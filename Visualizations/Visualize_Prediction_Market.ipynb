My aim is to express my views on the importance of election contracts in the regulated marketplace.\\nAs a business owner, I proactively use the predictive value that Kalshi\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s markets provide to anticipate economic and political shifts (that are caused by who is elected or who is leading the polls in an election race) that oftentimes end up impacting my own business. This tool is great because the predicted political and economic shifts they provide helps me make strategic decisions that ensure my business continues to grow and adapt. This is crucial for small business owners like myself who need to navigate the uncertainties of economic and political landscapes.\\nI would like to highlight that the CFTC's election cop argument is not credible, and the current interpretation undermines the potential benefits these contracts offer for the predictive value, market transparency, and ability to manage risk associated with one's own finances and the finances of their business.\\nI am also concerned about the general approach of the CFTC. Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to ask questions, do the hard work to understand these markets, and engage more actively with stakeholders to understand the practical implications of these regulations. Thus, I request that the CFTC extend the comment period an additional 60 days.\\nThank you for your consideration.\\nSincerely,\\nDavid Chen\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"has attachments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"attachment link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://comments.cftc.gov/Handlers/PdfHandler.ashx?id=35402\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"attachment filename\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"73949IlyaBeylin.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Classification\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PRO\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Key Evidence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 768,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am in complete opposition to the Commission\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s proposed rule\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI strongly encourage the Commission to approve Kalshi's contract for listing\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt seems perverse to prevent would-be hedgers from using a product that would benefit them on the basis that too many others would use it for speculation.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt would be disappointing to see these novel standards applied to Kalshi\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s contract as precedent for future submissions.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reasoning\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 776,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The commenter explicitly states they do not want the markets eliminated or interfered with and argues they cause no harm.

My aim is to express my views on the importance of election contracts in the regulated marketplace.\\nAs a business owner, I proactively use the predictive value that Kalshi\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s markets provide to anticipate economic and political shifts (that are caused by who is elected or who is leading the polls in an election race) that oftentimes end up impacting my own business. This tool is great because the predicted political and economic shifts they provide helps me make strategic decisions that ensure my business continues to grow and adapt. This is crucial for small business owners like myself who need to navigate the uncertainties of economic and political landscapes.\\nI would like to highlight that the CFTC's election cop argument is not credible, and the current interpretation undermines the potential benefits these contracts offer for the predictive value, market transparency, and ability to manage risk associated with one's own finances and the finances of their business.\\nI am also concerned about the general approach of the CFTC. Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to ask questions, do the hard work to understand these markets, and engage more actively with stakeholders to understand the practical implications of these regulations. Thus, I request that the CFTC extend the comment period an additional 60 days.\\nThank you for your consideration.\\nSincerely,\\nDavid Chen\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"has attachments\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"attachment link\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://comments.cftc.gov/Handlers/PdfHandler.ashx?id=35402\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"attachment filename\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 183,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"73949IlyaBeylin.pdf\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Classification\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"PRO\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Key Evidence\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 768,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI am in complete opposition to the Commission\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s proposed rule\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cI strongly encourage the Commission to approve Kalshi's contract for listing\\u00e2\\u0080\\u00a6\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt seems perverse to prevent would-be hedgers from using a product that would benefit them on the basis that too many others would use it for speculation.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d, \\u00e2\\u0080\\u009cIt would be disappointing to see these novel standards applied to Kalshi\\u00e2\\u0080\\u0099s contract as precedent for future submissions.\\u00e2\\u0080\\u009d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Reasoning\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 776,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The commenter explicitly states they do not want the markets eliminated or interfered with and argues they cause no harm.
