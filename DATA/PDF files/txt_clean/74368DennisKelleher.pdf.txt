## Re: Comment on Proposed Rulemaking on Event Contracts

## Dear Chair Behnam,

We are writing in response to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's ("CFTC') proposal to amend its rules concerning event contracts in certain excluded commodities (the 'Proposal'). We, the undersigned individuals and organizations, firmly support the CFTC's Proposal due to the substantial and multifaceted threats that political event contracts pose to our democratic processes, financial market integrity, public trust, and the CFTC's important mission serving the American people.

Firstly,  political  event  contracts  undermine  the  integrity  of  elections  by  introducing  financial incentives that can drive manipulation and interference. Allowing betting on election outcomes creates dangerous circumstances where individuals or groups might attempt to influence electoral processes for financial gain. This not only threatens the fairness of elections but also encourages unethical and potentially illegal activities aimed at skewing results.

Secondly, the Proposal is vital to prevent the erosion of public trust in our electoral system. In an era where misinformation and disinformation are rampant, adding a layer of financial speculation to  elections will exacerbate public skepticism. By prohibiting these contracts as against public policy, the CFTC would help protect the right to vote, ensure that those elected reflect the will of the voters, preserve the sanctity of the electoral process, and reinforce the message that elections are about civic duty and democratic participation, not financial speculation.

Moreover, our support for the Proposal is rooted in several key aspects of the amendments, which are  crucial  for  maintaining  the  integrity  and  fairness  of  both  our  financial  markets  and  our democratic  systems.  For  example,  the  amendments  focus  on  simplifying  the  criteria  for  what constitutes an event contract that "involves" an enumerated activity, such as political events, is significant and important. By concentrating solely on contracts that "involve" these activities, the CFTC can more effectively prevent contracts that may indirectly link to gambling from being listed or  cleared.  This  is  essential  to  close  loopholes  that  could  otherwise  be  exploited  to  introduce harmful speculative practices into the market.

Furthermore, clarifying the definition of "gaming" within the CFTC's regulatory framework is a vital component of this Proposal. By explicitly including the staking or risking of something of value  on  the  outcome  of  various  contests,  including  political  contests,  the  CFTC  can  more effectively identify and regulate these event contracts. This clarity helps ensure that any event contract involving political contests, such as elections, is appropriately categorized as gaming. This includes not only the outcomes of elections but also related events such as candidate entries or  withdrawals  and  polling  results.  This  comprehensive  approach  is  necessary  to  address  all potential avenues for speculative gambling on political events.

Most  importantly,  the  proposed  amendment  to  categorically  determine  that  event  contracts involving political contests are contrary to the public interest is a decisive and necessary measure. By prohibiting these contracts from being listed for trading or accepted for clearing on CFTC regulated markets, the CFTC is taking an appropriately strong stance to protect the public interest. This prohibition addresses the significant public interest concerns associated with political event contracts,  ensuring  that  the  integrity  of  our  elections  and  the  public's  trust  in  the  democratic process are not compromised by speculative financial activities.

From a regulatory  perspective,  the  CFTC's  mandate  is  to  oversee  commodity  and  derivatives markets, making sure they function effectively for hedging and price discovery. That ensures that vitally important commodities are available to the American people when they want them, in the amounts they want, and at prices that reasonable reflect supply and demand. Whether the CFTC does that job well or poorly impacts everything from cereal and coffee at breakfast, bread and peanut butter in lunch sandwiches, gas for cars and trucks, cotton for shirts and skirts, and sugar in  almost  everything.  In  contrast,  political  event  contracts  offer  no  such  significant  hedging benefits and do not contribute to price discovery. Instead, they represent speculative gambling that falls outside the CFTC's regulatory expertise, experience, and purview, and will detract the CFTC from  its  primary  mission.  By  focusing  on  commodities  that  impact  everyday  life,  such  as agricultural  products  and  energy  resources,  the  CFTC  can  continue  to  serve  and  protect  the American people.

In conclusion, the CFTC's Proposal is a necessary and decisive action to protect our democratic institutions,  uphold  market  integrity,  and  maintain  public  confidence.  By  prohibiting  political event contracts, the CFTC will prevent the introduction of significant risks and ensure that its regulatory  focus  remains  aligned  with  its  core  mission  of  safeguarding  the  integrity  and functionality  of  the  commodity  and  derivatives  markets.  We  urge  the  CFTC  to  finalize  and implement the Proposal without delay.
