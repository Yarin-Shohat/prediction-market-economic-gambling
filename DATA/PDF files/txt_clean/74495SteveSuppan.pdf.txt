17 CFR Part 40 RIN 3038 -AF14 Event Contracts Notice of proposed rulemaking ('NPR') (https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2024/06/2024-12125a.pdf)

Submitted electronically

Dear Mr. Kirkpatrick,

The Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy ('IATP') (IATP is a nonprofit, 501(c)(3) nongovernmental organization, headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with offices in Washington, D.C. and Berlin, Germany. IATP participated in the Commodity Markets Oversight Coalition (CMOC) from 2009 to 2015, the Derivatives Task Force of Americans for Financial Reform from 2010 to 2016, and the AFR Wall Street Reform Working Group from 2016 to the present. IATP is a member of the Commission's Technology Advisory Committee. Since 2010, IATP has submitted over 50 comment letters to the Commission.)  appreciates the opportunity to comment on the Event Contracts NPR.  We most recently wrote about one event contract proposal referenced in  the NPR  in  our July  24, 2023,  letter on the  Kalshi 'Control Contracts.' (https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=72722&amp;SearchText=)  We urged the Commission to not approve that contract and such self-certified political event contracts and election-based betting contracts in general. IATP thanks the Commission for its decision to disapprove the 'Control Contracts.' (Regarding  KalshiEX LLC - Commission Regulation  40.2(a) Notification Regarding  the Initial Listing of the 'Will <chamber  of Congress>  be controlled by <party>  for <term>?' Contract  ['Control  Contract'] 'CFTC Disapproves Kalshi EXLLC's Congressional Control Contracts,' September 22, 2023. https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8780-23)

IATP strongly supports the preamble of the NPR and the proposed amendments to the § 40.11 'Review  of event contracts based upon certain excluded commodities.'

This  short  comment emphasizes  the well-reasoned  statutory and  regulatory foundation for the NPR.

## Regarding the definitions of 'war' and 'terrorism' in an amended § 40.11

We  propose  that the  Commission consider  further  definitions of 'excluded commodities'  in §  40.11  to  anticipate  possible  regulatory  evasion  of  prohibited contracts. For example, should the current prohibition on contracts involving 'war' need further definition to include not just hostile military acts between states but also state sponsoring of or state affiliation with private actors that attempt to destroy or disable  computer  networked  physical  and  financial  infrastructure? The  preamble states,  'The Commission  does not believe that  it  is  necessary to define 'terrorism,' 'assassination,' or 'war' at this time.' (Federal Register ('FR'), p. 48977) A footnote to this  sentence  explains,  'The  Commission  clarifies,  however,  that  it  believes  that cyberattacks and other acts of cyberterrorism constitute terrorism, and in some cases war, and are also likely to constitute activity  that is unlawful under state or federal law.' (Footnote 85)

While IATP appreciates this clarification, preambles, although crucial for understanding an agency's reasoning about a regulation, are not legally enforceable. The  federal  definitions  of  terrorism (https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331) do  not  anticipate  that  the  intention  of  a terroristic attack could  be  economic gain or disruption. The  Commission's Technology  Advisory Committee's cybersecurity subcommittee will soon  be presenting its report and recommendations on cybersecurity and financial markets. Before  the  Commission  finalizes  its  definitions  for  the  revised  §40.11,  it  should review the report to help it decide whether the risks to markets of cyberattacks and cybersecurity failures merits an amended definition of 'war' and 'terrorism' in the rule or whether the footnoted clarification will suffice.

In  theory,  the  statute  and  the  § 40.11's  inclusion  of  'similar  activities'  to  those explicitly  prohibited  as  involved  in  event  contracts  might  be  considered  as  an adequate  firewall  against  such  event  contract  regulatory  evasion  of  prohibited 'Enumerated Activities.'  However, we live in a perilous jurisprudential landscape in which long-standing  precedents  in the  delegation  of  statutory authority  and administrative  law  are in jeopardy. Therefore, we contend, the Commission should consider defining 'war' and 'terrorism' as prohibited activities involved in the listing of  derivatives  contracts.  If  the  Commission  decides  that  such  definitions  are  not warranted, we urge the Commission to include footnote 85 in the amended rule itself.

## Regarding the NPR's proposed methodology for evaluating event contracts

The NPR is not a review of a single proposed event contract. (For readers unfamiliar with  event  contracts,  the  NPR  gives  a  sample  of  those  contracts  that  Designated Contract  Markets  (DCMs)  have  self-certified for  trading. ('These have included event contracts based on the occurrence or nonoccurrence of international events, natural disasters in specific U.S.  cities,  heating/cooling degree days and cumulative average temperature in specific cities,  the timing of video game a nd album releases, Oscar award winners, COVID-19 case levels and restrictions, the outcome of cases pending before the Supreme Court of the United States, the passage of specific laws by the U.S. Congress,  U.S.  Presidential approval ratings, confirmation of U.S. executive branch officials, National Football League (''NFL'') television ratings, the discovery of exoplanets, and the occurrence of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration moon landing before a certain date.' Federal Register  / Vol.  89, No. 112 / Monday, June 10, 2024 / Proposed Rules, p. 48969, footnote 9) ) It is  important  to understand the status of the NPR because if it were a review of a single contract, then Commissioner Caroline Pham would be correct to expect that  the preamble to the NPR  include  a  summary  of  comments  on  the  Commission's  review  of  a  single application  for the  Commission's  approval of political  control event  contracts.  By deciding not to include a summary of comments from the Commission's review of the Kalshi Control Contracts, the Commission is  not engaged in 'selective  amnesia,'  as Commissioner Pham charges. ('Appendix 4: Statement of Commissioner Caroline Pham,' 'Missing Comments,' FR, 49900.)

The  NPR  cites  comments  neither  supporting  nor  opposing  the  Kalshi  Control Contracts because the NPR concerns types of event contracts in general, not the Kalshi Control Contracts per se. If, in her invitation to request comments about the so-called 'Missing Comment Letters,' the Commissioner seeks to build an evidentiary pathway to overturning an Event Contracts final rule for putatively violating the Administrative Procedures Act, IATP believes her request for comments about the so called 'Missing Comment Letters' will prove to be legally irrelevant.

In  2022, the  Futures Industry  Association (FIA)  asked the  Commission  to provide guidance on categories of event contracts that were among the Enumerated Activities that would be contrary to the public interest: 'In conducting this review [of the first Kalshi Control Contracts self-certification], we urge the Commission to set forth clear ex-ante guidance to market participants about which  event contracts are permissible under the  Act  and  applicable  CFTC Regulations,  including  Regulation  40.11. ' (https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=70906&amp;SearchText=, p. 2.) The Commission  cannot  provide  ex-ante  guidance  on  a  contract  by  contract  basis.  In effect, the NPR responds to the FIA request for ex-ante guidance. The preamble notes, ' As  part  of any  final  rule  resulting  from  this  Notice  of Proposed Rulemaking,  the Commission intends to include an Appendix E to Part 40 containing guidance in the form  of  factors  the  Commission  may  consider,  in  addition  to  other  factors  the Commission deems appropriate in light of individual  facts and circumstances, when making a determination under § 40.11(a)(2) that such event contracts are contrary to the public interest.'  (FR, p. 48984) Appendix E,  together with  the final rule, will supply the ex-ante guidance that FIA and other market participants  have requested about event contracts.

The NPR describes a two-step general methodology to determine whether a proposed event contract (or swap contract) is 'contrary to the public interest.'

First, the Commission must assess whether a contract in a specified excluded commodity ''involve[s ] '' an activity enumerated in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i)(I) -(V) (each,  an  ''Enumerated  Activity'') or  other  similar activity  as determined by the Commission by rule or regulation (''prescribed similar  activity'').  If  the  Commission  determines  that  the  contract  involves such activity,  the Commission must assess whether the contract is contrary to the public interest. (FR, 48971)

Although  this  methodology  is  clear  and  straightforward,  its  application  to  each proposed event contract  would  be time  and  resource intensive  both  for the  DCM researching and designing the proposed contract and Commission staff reviewing it according to the two-step  process. Therefore, the preamble and the  amended rule advise  DCMs of which  types  of contracts involving  Enumerated  Activities,  such  as 'war' and 'gaming,' that the Commission will determine to be 'contrary to the public interest' and therefore ar e prohibited.

IATP agrees with the Commission's reasoning and conclusion that the amended rule will  both  assist  DCM's  business  planning  and  contract  design  while  conserving Commission staff resources from repeated reviews of individual contracts that may be 'contrary to the public interest. ' (FR, p. 48972) Nevertheless, despite this two-step methodology for types of event contracts, the preamble allows that the Commission may have to review individual  contracts in cases where the contract characteristics involved  with  'gaming'  do not  clearly identify  it  as  a  prohibited  contract.  (FR,  p. 48974) In sum, this methodology is pragmatic but not inflexibly dogmatic.

In the following section, IATP affirms the Commission's statutory authority for and regulatory implementation  involving types of contracts determined to be 'contrary to the public interest.' We conclude our comment with remarks on 'gaming,' the one Enumerated Activity  that the Commission proposes to define in its amendments to § 40.11.

## The alignment of the Commission's statutory authority and §40.11

The  statutory authority  for  the NPR  provides  for  the  Commission to  make determinations about which type of event contracts [and swaps] are 'contrary to the public interest:' ' the  Commission may determine that such agreements, contracts, or transactions  are  contrary  to  the  public  interest  if  the  agreements,  contracts,  or transactions involve' ('Special rule for review and approval of event contracts and swaps contracts,' in U.S. Code 7 § 7.a -2- 'Common provisions applicable to registered entities,' https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/7/7a 2#fn002034)  followed by a short list of types of event contracts that would be  prohibited  as  'contrary  to  the  public  interest. 'Such,'  meaning  'of  the  type previously mentioned' or 'of the type about to mentioned,' (Oxford Languages, https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/)   demonstrates that the statute concerns types of contracts and not individual contracts per se.

IATP disagrees with Commissioner Summer Mersinger's interpretation of the statute and  as  a  result  with  much  of  her dissent:  ' There is  no  provision  in  CEA  Section 5c(c)(5)(C)  for public  interest  determinations  regarding event contracts  involving enumerated activities  to be made by category.' (Appendix 3, Statement of Commissioner Summer K. Mersinger, FR, p. 48994.)  A plain text reading of the statute shows that Commission has the discretion ('may determine') to make public interest determinations on categories of contracts. Furthermore, the Commission notes, ' the statute does not require this public interest determination to be made on a contractspecific  basis.' (FR,  p. 48978) If  the CEA  required the Commission  to make  public interest  determinations  on  a  contract-by-contract  basis,  much  of the  work  of the Division  of  Market  Oversight  would  be  delayed,  given  the  refusal of  Congress to provide the Commission with resources adequate to oversee expanding markets in the hundreds of new contracts DCMs self-certify annually.

This NPR proposes that the Commission will  evaluate a category of event contracts, namely prohibited contracts,  by revising 17 CFR  § 40.11, which  currently reads in part:

(a) Prohibition. A registered entity shall not list for trading or accept for clearing on or through the registered entity any of the following:

(1) An agreement, contract, transaction, or swap based upon an excluded commodity, as defined in Section 1a(19)(iv) of the Act, that involves, relates to, or references terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or an activity that is unlawful under any State or Federal law; or

(2) An agreement, contract, transaction, or swap based upon an excluded commodity, as defined in Section 1a(19)(iv) of the Act, which involves, relates to, or references an activity that is similar to an activity enumerated in § 40.11(a)(1) of this part, and that the Commission determines, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest. ('§ 40.11 'Review of event contracts based upon certain excluded commodities,' https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/40.11)

IATP supports the Commission's proposal to delete 'relates to, or references' from § 40.11 to align the rule more closely with the language of its corresponding statutory authority. We also agree that 'gaming' should be further defined, as we outline in the next section. 

The impetus for the proposed amendments to § 40.11 is not the review of any one event contract, but the rapid increase in the number of DCM self-certified event contracts since §40.11 was promulgated in 2011. (The preamble does not refer to any Commission review of a swap contract based on an excluded commodity.) This increase is summarized in NPR footnote 9, which reads in part: 

From 2006 -2020, DCMs listed for trading an average of approximately five event contracts per year. In 2021, this number increased to 131, and the number of newly-listed event contracts per year has remained at a similar level in subsequent years. Since 2021, DCMs also have listed for trading a substantial number of event contracts not associated with traditional commodities, financial indices, or economic indicators. 

Some of these event contracts do not serve the commercial hedging purpose of traditional commodity derivatives contracts, nor do they have corresponding cash markets whose trading data form the underlying assets of derivatives contracts. Furthermore, event contracts are no longer the domain of retail investors, as registered entities are organizing to attract institutional investors to event contracts. (Lydia Beyoud, 'Susquehanna's New Trading Desk Bets on Events from Bitcoin to Taylor Swift,' Bloomberg, April 3, 2024. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/susquehanna-starts- trading-desk-for-event-contracts-on-kalshi)

There are event contracts that involve financial, economic and foreign exchange indicators and rates that 'would generally fall outside of the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and § 40.11.' (FR, p. 48973) IATP agrees with the proposed non -exhaustive list of indicators and rates proposed by the Commission for event contracts that are not prohibited under an amended §40.11. 

In response to the Commission's question, 'Are there additional types of event contracts that should be explicitly identified by the Commission in the non-exclusive list of contract types that would generally fall outside of the scope of CEA section 5c(c)( 5)(C) and § 40.11?' (FR, p. 48973) IATP believes that event contracts involved with cryptocurrencies and other digital assets (e.g., carbon credits tokens), when used in legitimate commercial activities may require explicit identification. (IATP concurs with researchers who find legitimate use cases for cryptocurrency to be scarce. IATP notes that the CFTC Director of Enforcement reported that half of its enforcement activities in 2023 involved cryptocurrencies. 'Remarks by Enforcement Director Ian McGinley at the White Collar City Bar: Trends in Cryptocurrency Enforcement,' May 23, 2024. https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opamcginley Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the political and lobbying support to legitimize cryptocurrency transactions and clearing through legislation and regulation. As a result, if the Commission becomes the predominant regulator of digital assets, we make our recommendation to include cryptocurrency contracts in the non-exhaustive list of types of contracts not covered by §40.11.)

## The proposed redefinition of 'gaming'

Since  rule § 40.11  was  promulgated  in  2011,  only  event  contracts  concerning 'gaming'  have been  presented by  DCMs  for the  Commission's  formal review  and approval. The Commission proposes to define 'gaming' so that designers of proposed event contracts can evaluate wheth er the Commission 'may determine' that event contracts involved with gaming are contrary to the public interest. The NPR states,

Proposed § 40.11(b)(2) states that ''gaming'' includes, but is not limited to, the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon: (i) the outcome of a political contest, including an election or elections; (ii) the outcome of an awards contest;  (iii)  the  outcome of a game in  which  one or more athletes compete; or (iv)  an occurrence or nonoccurrence in connection with  such a contest  or game,  regardless of whether  it  directly  affects the  outcome. The Commission  emphasizes  that  the  list  of  examples  provided in  proposed § 40.11(b)(2) is non-exclusive. (FR, 48975)

IATP  agrees  with  this  definition  because  it  is  clearly  stated  and  will  assist  the Commission to determine what type of event contracts are contrary to the  public interest in the use of derivatives contracts, e.g., the price basing utility of  a contract.

Part (i) of this  definition, as explained in the preamble, is comprehensive, covering the  widest  range  of  domestic  and  foreign  jurisdictions,  to  include  one  or  more elections that result in a gaming outcome, such as the party control of a chamber of a legislature.  Furthermore,  a  contract  involving  an  occurrence  or  non-occurrence affecting  political  contests,  such as  the withdrawal  of a  candidate,  would  likewise apply to the definition of 'gaming,' even if the occurrence or non -occurrence did not affect the outcome of the contest. (FR, p. 48976)

Gamblers who attempt to distract  or disrupt athletic  contests while  gambling with the  use of their  cellphones has become a feature of sporting events. (E.g.,  Danny Funt, 'One soundtrack at the U.S. Open: Heckling from gamblers,' The Washington Post June 17, 2024. https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2024/06/17/one-soundtrack-us-open-heckling- gamblers/)   As the  NPR notes, some state laws that allow gambling on sports events do not allow betting on occurrences  or  non-occurrences  (e.g.,  a  player doesn't  play)  associated  with  a sporting  event.  (FR,  p.  48976) Derivatives  contracts based  on 'gaming'  and  such occurrences as heckling or the injury of a player during a contest would be prohibited under the definition of 'gaming' in the amended §40.11. Likewise, IATP believes it would  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest  if  retail  or  institutional  investors  were allowed  to  bet  on occurrences or non-occurrences associated  with  political  event contracts, such as a contract based on which candidate was first to report X amount of political campaign contributions by Y date.

The  likelihood  would  be  high  that such  a  contract  would  be  susceptible  to manipulation, in violation of Core Principle 3. For example, an event contract investor could  produce a  deep  fake  that  disrupts  political  contributions  and  make  a  High Frequency Trading killing on the contract involving the candidate benefiting from the deep fake. IATP strongly agrees with the preamble's statement that 'The lack of price forming  information  for  contracts  involving  ''gaming,'' or  the  availability  of  only opaque and/or unregulated sources of price forming information, may increase the risk  of manipulative  activity  relating  to  the  trading  and pricing  of such contracts, while  decreasing the ability  of the offering exchange, or the Commission,  to detect such activity.' (FR, p. 48982)

It may be the case that threatened or actual litigation  against the revised §40.11 rule and/or a campaign of comment letters  from retail  and  institutional  political  event contract investors opposing the rule will  cite the 2018 U.S.  Supreme Court decision striking  down  the  1992  federal prohibition  against  commercial  gambling  in  most states. (E.g.,  Adam Liptak and Kevin Draper, 'Supreme Court Ruling Favors Sports Betting,' Times The New York ,  May 14, 2018. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new- jersey.html) IATP does not believe that the  definition of 'gaming,'  in the context of an amended §40.11 applied to derivatives  contracts, contravenes that  ruling  to allow states to license commercial gambling establishments offering cash-based contracts.

However, IATP cannot predict how courts will  review a final amended §40.11 rule. The Commission is prudent to ask, 'If, on judicial review, it is determined that staking something of value on the outcome of a political contest does not involve ''gaming,'' the Commission may consider whether that activity  is ''similar to'' g aming. Is staking something of value on the outcome of a political  contest similar  to gaming?' (FR, p. 48977) In the event of an adverse court ruling concerning a final amended §40.11, the  Commission  should consider whether  a  political  event  contract  is  'similar  to' gaming. A strong foundation for this consideration is the Commission's analysis of the public  interest  in  derivatives  contracts  that  have  commercial  hedging  and  price basing utility  function, among other economic purposes that can be evaluated based on standardized, transparent and reliable data historically associated with categories of physically backed and financial derivatives contracts.

## Defining and interpreting 'contrary to the public interest'

IATP supports a review  of event  contracts 'similar  to' gaming in  part because the Commission's very well -founded analysis of the public interest in derivatives trading and  clearing  cannot  be  overturned  by  the  courts  without  also  overturning  the economic  purpose,  analytic  tools  and  the  supporting  data  of  that  purpose  of derivatives trading embedded in a history of Commission decisions. Furthermore, as noted above, the Commission will reference other public interest factors in Appendix E to Part 40, which will be published with the final rule. (FR, p. 48984)

The NPR notes, 'The term 'public interest' is not defined in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C). As discussed more fully below, historically, the Commission has evaluated whether a contract is contrary to the public interest with reference to the contract's commercia l hedging or price-basing utility.  The Commission has also, however, regularly stated that  other  public  interest  factors  may  be  considered.'  (FR,  p.  48978)  The  NPR identifies  five  other  factors: 'identified  in  section  15(a)  of the  CEA:  protection  of market participants and  the public; efficiency, competitiveness, and  financial integrity of the markets; price discovery; sound risk management practices; and other public interest considerations.' (FR, 48991)

Commissioner  Mersinger  dismisses these  factors  but  inadvertently raises  an important  regulatory issue: 'Aside from the ''economic purpose test,' the  Proposal points to a hodgepodge of other factors to try to justify prohibiting entire categories of event contracts, whose terms and conditions the Commission has never seen, from being  traded  on  exchanges.'  (FR.,  p.  48996)  It  i s  unfortunate  that  DCM  selfcertifications  of  hundreds  of  contracts  as  consistent  with  the  CEA  and  the  Core Principles allows such contracts to enter into trade, often without an adequate staff review of the co ntract's supporting documentation, much less a Commission review of the contracts, even those with  novel features, such as the Global Emissions Offset futures  contract. (Steve Suppan, 'What underlies the underlying (asset) of CO₂ emissions offset futures contracts?' Institute for Agriculture  and Trade Policy, March 31, 2021. https://www.iatp.org/blog/202103/what - underlies-underlying-asset-co2-emissions-offset-futures-contracts)   Self-certification  allows,  but  does  not  require,  a  Commission perennially  starved  of  resources by  Congress to  delegate  its  authority  over  new contracts to the DCMs. Commissioner Mersinger's disparagement points to a need for a Commission review of how self-certification  documentation  is  reviewed by staff generally, not just for event contracts. (Lee Reiners, 'Bitcoin Futures: From Self-Certification to Systemic Risk,' Global Association of Risk Professionals, January 24, 2019. https://www.garp.org/white-paper/bitcoin-futures-from-self-certification- to-systemic-risk)

Commissioner Mersinger argues that the CFTC is being 'paternalistic' when it seeks to  protect  retail  market  participants  who  are  investing  in  event  contracts  in competition with large institutional  investors. (FR, p. 48996) While it is true that the Commission  lacks  the  rules  and  staffing  comparable to  that  for the  Security  and Exchange Commission's protection  of retail  customers, it  does not follow  that  the Commission should ignore or diminish the protection of retail market participants in event  contracts.  If  a  category  of  event  contracts  disadvantages  retail  market participants,  compared to  institutional  investors with  far greater information  and financial resources, the Commission's protection of retail investors is not paternalistic.  The Commission  has  various  means  to  protect  retail  investors,  e.g., fraud  alerts  and  educational  programs.  But  the  discretion  to  determine  which category of contracts are contrary to the public interest is yet another indispensable means of market participant protection.

## Conclusion

IATP  thanks  the  Commission  for  releasing  for  comment  this  very  timely  and important  NPR.  We  hope  that  our  comments  assist  the  staff  and  Commission  to expeditiously finalize this rule.

Respectfully submitted, Steve Suppan, Ph.D. Senior Policy Analyst
