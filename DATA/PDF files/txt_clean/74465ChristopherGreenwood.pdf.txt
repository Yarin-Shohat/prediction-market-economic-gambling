## Re: Comments on KalshiEx, LLC's Proposed Congressional Control Contracts

## Commissioners:

We sincerely appreciate the opportunity to comment on the submission by KalshiEx, LLC of its proposed Congressional control contracts for Commission review and approval. The question of election event contracts raises important issues of both law and public policy, and we commend the Commission for recognizing their importance and seeking public input.

We submit this comment on behalf of an anonymous client with a deep interest in the lawfulness of election event contracts.

We believe the Commission has a sound basis in law and policy for approving Kalshi's proposed contracts.  As to the law, we believe that election event contracts like Kalshi's do not 'involve gaming' under Section 5c(c)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) or Rule 40.11 of the Commission's regulations, and so are not proscribed by those provisions.   In addition,  we  believe  that  Rule  40.11,  properly  understood  in  light  of  the  CEA  and  the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), affords the Commission discretion to approve election event contracts even if those contracts do 'involve gaming.'  Finally, as to policy, we believe election  event  contracts  promote  the  public  good  by,  among  other  things,  enhancing  the accuracy  of  political  predictions,  promoting  new  forms  of  democratic  participation,  and serving  as  an  economic  hedge  for  both  firms  and  individuals.    We  thus  encourage  the Commission to approve Kalshi's proposed contracts.

## I. Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 Do Not Apply to Election Event Contracts.

Under the CEA, the Commission must approve contracts submitted to it unless the Commission affirmatively finds that they violate the CEA or the Commission's regulations. 7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(B); 17 C.F.R. § 40.3(b).  The Commission has expressed concern that election event contracts may conflict with Section 5c(c)(5)(C) of the Act and Rule 40.11, which together prohibit event contracts based on gaming, four other enumerated activities, or 'other similar activity determined by the Commission, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest.'  But an election is not gaming, nor any of the other four prohibited activities, nor a 'similar activity determined by the Commission, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest.'  Thus, Kalshi's contracts are lawful and should be approved.

The Commission previously found an election event contract to be gaming because the contract itself was a form of gaming. N. Am. Derivatives Exch., Inc. ( Nadex ), slip op. at 3 (CFTC Apr. 2, 2012).  Respectfully, we believe the Commission erred in that Order and should not adhere to that position here.  Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 prohibit event contracts where the event on which the event contract is based is an act of gaming.  They do not prohibit event contracts simply because entering into the contract might itself be construed as a form of gaming.  Indeed, as explained below, all event contracts involve making predictions (and related wagers) about future 'occurrences' that are outside of the relevant parties' control. Were  this  facial  similarity  with  'gaming'  all  that  were  required  to  fall  within  Section 5c(c)(5)(C)'s  reach,  every  event  contract  would  be  implicated-a  plainly  untenable  result. Moreover, even if considered under the Nadex Order's framing, an election event contract is still not gaming.  'Gaming' has a well-established and precise meaning: betting on games of chance.  An election is not a game of chance-or even a game at all-so staking money on an election is not gaming.  Finally, at the very least, Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 do not clearly prohibit election event contracts and several traditional canons of construction weigh against construing them to do so here.

## A. Standard of Review.

The meaning of the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commission's regulations is a question of law to be answered using 'the traditional tools of construction.' Kisor v. Wilkie , 139 S. Ct. 2400, 2415 (2019) (cleaned up).  In particular, the Commission must apply these provisions according to their 'ordinary meaning.' Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States , 138 S. Ct. 2067, 2070 (2018) (citation omitted).  The term 'gaming' in Rule 40.11(a) comes from Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i)(V)  of  the CEA without alteration.  Thus, even if genuine ambiguity remains after  applying  the  traditional  tools  of  construction,  the  Commission  still  must  apply  the term's  ordinary  meaning. See Kisor ,  139  S.  Ct.  at  2417  n.5  (an  agency  does  not  receive 'deference' when it 'interprets a rule that parrots the statutory text').

## B. An Election Event Contract Is Based on an Election-Not Gaming or Any Other Prohibited Activity.

Under  the  CEA,  an  event-that  is,  an  'occurrence,  extent  of  an  occurrence,  or contingency' outside of the relevant parties' control-can be an excluded commodity that forms the basis of a contract.  7 U.S.C. § 1a(19)(iv).  Under Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i) of the Act, the Commission may determine that an event contract is contrary to the public interest if the contract 'involve[s]' an event falling within one of six categories: 'activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law,' 'terrorism,' 'assassination,' 'war,' 'gaming,' and 'other similar activity determined by the Commission, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest.' Id. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i).  Contracts that the Commission finds to be against the public interest are prohibited. Id. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(ii).  Rule 40.11 provides that any contract 'based upon an excluded commodity … that involves, relates to, or references' the first five categories is prohibited.  17 C.F.R. § 40.11(a)(1).

These provisions are best read to exclude election event contracts.  Elections are not games and so cannot be seen as gaming.  Nor can the election event contract itself supply the requisite  'gaming,'  as  that  would  upend  the  statutory  scheme  by  converting  every event contract  into  'gaming.'    After  all,  every  event  contract  is  based  on  an  uncertain  future occurrence.  Such an interpretation of 'gaming' would thus, in turn, read out of the statute the other terms in Section 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i)-'war,' 'assassination,' etc-because each would be 'gaming' under that view.  Such an interpretation is not plausible, as detailed further below.

1. The Statutory and Regulatory Text Shows That Election Contracts Are Based on Elections Rather Than Gaming or Other Prohibited Activities.

An  election  for  public  office  is  not  any  of  the  activities  enumerated  in  Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i).  It is (obviously) not an unlawful activity, terrorism, assassination, or war.  But neither is it gaming.  'Gaming' is the playing of 'games of chance for money.' Game , New Oxford American Dictionary (3d ed. 2010).  Unlike dice, roulette, and other games of chance, elections are not primarily decided by pure luck; they are decided by the voters' deliberate choices as to who should hold the public office in question.  And even more fundamentally, elections  are  not  'games'  in  the  first  place.    They  are  not  'engaged  in  for  diversion  or amusement,' Game , Merriam-Webster's  Collegiate  Dictionary (11th  ed.  2020),  but  to determine who will occupy political offices across the country.  Finally, an election also does not fall within the final category of a 'similar activity determined by the Commission, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest,' 7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i)(VI), as elections are  not  similar  to  unlawful  activities,  terrorism,  assassination,  war,  or  gaming.    Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 are thus best read as not outlawing election event contracts.

The Commission's Nadex order took a different approach, asking instead whether 'the contract, considered as a whole,' constitutes gaming.  Slip op. at 2.  Respectfully, we believe that this analysis misconstrues the word 'involve' in the Act.  Section 5c(c)(5)(C) gives the Commission the power to ban contracts that 'involve' gaming-not contracts that might be seen as themselves constituting gaming when 'considered as a whole.'  Specifically, the CEA and the Commission's other regulations consistently use the term 'involve' to identify the commodity (event) on which the contract is based. (See,  e.g. ,  7  U.S.C.  §  6c(b)  ('No  person  shall  offer  to  enter  into  …  any  transaction  involving  any commodity ….'); id. § 15b(e) ('Each cotton futures contract … shall be in writing plainly stating … the terms of such contract , including the quantity of the cotton involved ….'); id. § 16(e)(1)(B) ('Nothing in this chapter shall supersede or preempt … the application of any Federal or State statute … to any transaction in or involving any commodity ….'); id. 23(b)(1) ('The Commission may set different terms and conditions for transactions involving different commodities.'); 17 C.F.R. § 1.17(c)(5)(iii)(C)(1)(iii) ('In the case of over-the-counter swap transactions involving commodities, 20 percent of the market value of the amount of the underlying commodities.'); id. § 5.9(d) ('A major currency pair security deposit percentage is only applicable when both sides of a retail over-the-counter foreign exchange transaction  involve  major  currencies.'); id. § 31.8(a)(2)(ii)  ('Permissible  cover  for  a  long  leverage contract is limited to: … one type of bulk gold coins for leverage contracts involving another type of bulk gold coins ….').)   For purposes of the Act, an event contract thus 'involves' gaming when the contract is based on a gaming event.

Rule 40.11 confirms as much.  The Rule is titled:  'Review of event contracts based upon certain  excluded  commodities.'    17  C.F.R.  §  40.11  (emphasis  added).    And  its  text prohibits any  '[a]greement,  contract, transaction,  or  swap based  upon an  excluded commodity,  as  defined  in  Section  1a(19)(iv)  of  the  Act,  that  involves,  relates  to,  or references … gaming.' Id. (emphasis added).  The Rule is thus clear that the contract must be  'based  upon'  the  particular  excluded  commodity  rather  than  itself  being  part  of  that commodity.  In other words, the contract must be based upon gaming rather than the contract itself constituting gaming.

Thus, an event contract that turns on whether a winner will be announced at the next Mega Millions Lottery drawing 'involves' gaming within the meaning of the Act, because such a contract is based on a gaming event-a lottery is a game of chance played for money. In contrast, an event contract that turns on the performance of a particular harvest, sector of  the  energy  industry,  or  election  for  public  office  does  not  'involve'  gaming  within  the meaning of the Act, because that sort of contract is not based on a game of chance.  Contrary to Nadex 's  reasoning, it is not dispositive-indeed, it cannot be dispositive-that entering into an event contract might be akin to gaming in some sense ( i.e. , staking money or other resources on the occurrence of a future event that is outside of the relevant parties' control). See slip op. at 2 & nn. 1 &amp; 2.  After all, every event contract shares this characteristic.  Such an interpretation of Section 5c(c)(5)(C) would thus preclude entering into any event contract under the CEA and Rule 40.11-an outcome that is self-evidently untenable, as explained at greater length below.

2. The Statutory and Regulatory Context Confirms That Election Contracts Are Based on Elections Rather Than Gaming or Other Prohibited Activities.

Context confirms that Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i) and Rule 40.11 are best understood to not reach election event contracts.  By their terms, these provisions apply only to contracts that are based on an excluded commodity that is an event outside the contracting parties' control. (Section  5c(c)(5)(C)(i)  refers  to  commodities described in 'section 1a(2)(i) of this  title,' a provision which does not exist, rather than Section 1a(19)(iv), which defines when an occurrence or contingency is  an  excluded  commodity.    That  is  a  scrivener's  error,  as  Rule  40.11  recognizes. See 17  C.F.R. 40.11(a)(1) (referring to commodities 'defined in Section 1a(19)(iv)').  And that definitional provision defines 'excluded commodity' to include, in relevant part, 'an occurrence … beyond the control of the parties  to  the  relevant  contract,  agreement,  or  transaction;  and  associated  with  a  financial, commercial, or economic consequence.'  7 U.S.C. § 1a(19)(iv)(I)-(II).) Likewise, the other listed activities are events outside the parties' control.  An event contract cannot itself constitute an act of terrorism, assassination, or war, whereas such acts can be the excluded commodities that underly an event contract.  It would be very strange if gaming were the only term in Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i) that referred to the nature of the entire contract rather than to the underlying excluded commodity.

Construing 'gaming' to include both the underlying occurrence and the contracts on that occurrence would, moreover, make the other subsections of Section 5c(c)(5)(C) surplus. After all, event contracts on whether New York City will be bombed in October ('terrorism'), whether Kim Jong Un will be killed ('assassination'), or whether Ukraine will defeat Russia ('war') are all equally bets on the outcomes of future events.  Each of these could simply be prohibited as a 'gaming' contract under the reasoning in the Commission's Nadex Order. Indeed, the broad Nadex construction would even risk supplanting the catchall provision for 'any other similar activity' the Commission identifies 'by rule or regulation,' 7 U.S.C. § 7a2(c)(5)(C)(i)(VI), since any event contract could be prohibited as 'gaming' under that view. That is not plausible.

Finally, although we do not believe the Commission should rely on Section 5c(c)(5)(C)'s legislative history to interpret Section 5c(c)(5)(C), (As the Supreme Court has explained, 'legislative history is not the law'; statutory interpretation must instead be based on 'statutory text' and 'structure.' Azar v. Allina Health Servs. , 139 S. Ct. 1804, 1814 (2019) (cleaned up).)  it too supports the view that election event contracts are not gaming.  When asked about the scope of the Commission's power to ban gaming  contracts,  Senator  Lincoln  replied  that  it  would  cover  event  contracts  based  on 'sporting  events  such  as  the  Super  Bowl,  the  Kentucky  Derby,  and  Masters  Golf Tournament.'    156  Cong.  Rec.  S5907  (daily  ed.  July  15,  2010).    All  these  examples  are contracts where the underlying commodity is the outcome of a game, which an election is not.

## C. An Election Event Contract Is Not Itself Gaming.

But  even  if  the Nadex Order  were  correct  to  consider  the  contract  as  well  as  the underlying commodity, we respectfully submit that the Order was still mistaken to apply that  reasoning  to  election  event  contracts.    Event  contracts  based  on  the  outcome  of  an election might be wagers , but not all wagers are gaming .  'Gaming' refers to placing stakes on the outcome of a game of chance.  And as noted above, an election is not a game of chance, a game of skill, or even a game at all.

The  ordinary  meaning  of  the  word  'gaming'  is  betting  on  games  of  chance. See Gaming , Oxford English Dictionary (3d ed. 2013) ('To take part in an indoor game, of a kind on which stakes or wagers may be placed; esp. to  play games of chance for such stakes or wagers'); Game , New Oxford American Dictionary , supra ('play games of chance for money'); Game , Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961) ('to  play for  a  stake  (as with cards, dice, or billiards)'); Gaming , The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary (4th ed. 2013) ('the risking of money in games of chance, especially at a casino').  Hence courts have long recognized that 'betting is not gaming unless the wager be laid upon a game.' In re Opinion of the Justs. ,  63  A.  505,  507  (N.H.  1906).    Had  Congress  wanted  to sweep  more broadly, it could have used the more common term 'gambling,' which encompasses bets on both games of chance and 'the  outcome of particular events' more generally. Gambling , Oxford English Dictionary , supra .  Indeed, the statutes relied upon in the Nadex Order to support  a  purported  'link'  between  'gaming'  and  'betting  on  elections'  mostly  use  the broader term 'gambling,' not 'gaming.'  See slip op. at 2 &amp; n. 1.

For contracts to constitute 'gaming,' there must thus be underlying games of chance. Elections are not games, let alone games of chance.  Election event contracts are thus best understood to not constitute gaming.

## D. Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 Do Not Clearly Prohibit Election Event Contracts.

We  further  believe  that  four  traditional  tools  of  construction  weigh  against  the Commission  applying  Section  5c(c)(5)(C)  and  Rule  40.11  to  election  event  contracts:  the federalism canon, the major questions doctrine, the presumption of validity, and the rule of lenity.  For the reasons detailed above, we do not believe these provisions are best read to include election event contracts.  But at a minimum, they do not clearly include election event contracts.  The Commission acknowledged as much when promulgating Rule 40.11, noting that  'the  term  'gaming'  requires  further  clarification'  and  may  not  extend  beyond 'participation in  traditional  'gaming'  activities.'    Final  Rulemaking, 76  Fed.  Reg.  44,776, 44,785 (July 27, 2011).  Accordingly, the Commission should not interpret these provisions to prohibit election event contracts.

## 1. The Federalism Canon and the Major Questions Doctrine

The Federalism canon provides that Congress must 'enact exceedingly clear language if it wishes to significantly alter the balance between federal and state power.' Ala. Ass'n of Realtors v. HHS , 141 S. Ct. 2485, 2489 (2021) (citation omitted).  Likewise, under the major questions doctrine, the Supreme Court has explained that Congress must 'speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.' West Virginia  v.  EPA ,  142  S.  Ct.  2587,  2605  (2022)  (citation  omitted).    We  believe  that  both principles are implicated here.

The regulation of gambling has long been 'the particular domain of state law.' Ala. Ass'n , 141 S. Ct. at 2489.  As a government of enumerated powers, the federal government does not possess a 'general police power,' which is instead 'retained by the States.' United States v. Lopez , 514 U.S. 549, 567 (1995).  Legislation 'to protect the public morals' lies at the core of the police power. Chi., B. &amp; Q. Ry. Co. v. Illinois , 200 U.S. 561, 592 (1906).  And gambling laws are quintessential public morals legislation. See Murphy , 138 S. Ct. at 1469. Hence, the lawfulness of gambling has long been a question of state law. See id. at 1468-71. The 'general federal approach' has been to prohibit certain interstate activities related to gambling, but 'only if that conduct is illegal under state or local law.' Id. at 1483; see 18 U.S.C. §§ 1084, 1952, 1953, 1955; 31 U.S.C. § 5363.

The regulation of gambling is also a matter of vast political and economic significance. Gambling is both a 'controversial issue' and an 'immensely popular' pastime, Murphy , 138 S. Ct. at 1469, 1483, which involves a great deal of money.  In 2020, for instance, customers of a single British betting company collectively staked £434 million (about $566 million) on the  outcome  of  the  U.S.  presidential  election.    T.  Adinarayan  &amp;  D.  Chowdhury, Bettors Stampede  Back  in  Favor  of  Biden  as  Results  Stream  in , Nat'l  Post (Nov.  4,  2020), https://tinyurl.com/4w54t2dk.  If the Commission interprets 'gaming' broadly, the size of the economic activity implicated will naturally be even greater. See Ala. Realtors , 141 S. Ct. at 2489 (evaluating the 'majorness' of a question by the larger consequences of the agency's assertion of authority, not merely the consequences of the specific outcome it is defending).

Given these considerations,  the  Commission should  not read  Section  5c(c)(5)(C)  to require that it ban event contracts which do not involve traditional gaming activities, i.e. , games of chance.  If Congress had wished to confer that authority on the Commission, it would have said so explicitly.

## 2. The Presumption of Validity

Under the presumption of validity, an 'interpretation that validates outweighs one that invalidates.'  Scalia &amp; Garner, supra , at 66.  Accordingly, the Commission should not adopt an interpretation of Rule 40.11 that would place it in conflict with Section 5c(c)(5)(C) or the APA if another interpretation is fairly possible. Cf. Jennings v. Rodriguez , 138 S. Ct. 830, 836 (2018) (applying the same principle for a statute vis-à-vis the Constitution).  Because reading  Rule  40.11  to  cover  election  event  contracts  would  place  it  in  conflict  with  those statutes,  we  respectfully  submit  that  the  Commission should not  read  it  to  apply  beyond contracts involving games of chance.

Section 5c(c)(5)(C) empowers the Commission to prohibit contracts involving gaming only by 'determin[ing]' that such contracts are 'contrary to the public interest.'  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i), (ii).  And the APA requires the Commission to give a reasoned explanation for its determination.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. ,  463 U.S. 29, 48 (1983).  In issuing Rule 40.11, the Commission noted that the term 'gaming' may not extend beyond 'participation in traditional 'gaming' activities'  and  that  it  would  'continue[]  to  consider'  whether  there  are  'bases  for distinguishing' such activities from 'trading in contracts linked to the occurrence (or nonoccurrence) of events.'  Final Rulemaking, 76 Fed. Reg. at 44,785.  The Commission thus never  determined  that  election    event  contracts  or  other  event  contracts  that  are  not traditional  gaming  activities  are  contrary  to  the  public  interest.    Still  less  did  it  give  a reasoned explanation for such a determination.  If Rule 40.11 covers these event contracts, then it conflicts with Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and is arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  The rule should thus instead be read to apply only to contracts involving games of chance.

## 3. Rule of Lenity

Where 'a reasonable doubt persists' about the scope of a penal provision, the provision must be construed not to impose liability. Moskal v. United States , 498 U.S. 103, 108 (1990). A penal provision is one whose violation may be punished with a civil or criminal penalty. See Wooden v. United States , 142 S. Ct. 1063, 1086 &amp; n.5 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in the judgment) (collecting authorities); Scalia & Garner, supra , at 297.  Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 implicate both kinds of penalty.  The Commission may civilly punish a registered entity that violates Rule 40.11 with suspension or revocation of its registration.  7 U.S.C.

§ 7b.  And any person who willfully violates Rule 40.11(a) is guilty of a felony. Id. § 13(a)(5). Nor does it matter that the Commission does not seek to punish Kalshi in this proceeding. 'The  rule  of  lenity  …  is  a  rule  of  statutory  construction  whose  purpose  is  to  help  give authoritative meaning to statutory language.' United States v. Thompson/Ctr. Arms Co. , 504 U.S. 505, 518 n.10 (1992).  As such, it always applies to a penal provision, even when the provision is being applied in a nonpenal context. Id. Once the rule of lenity is applied, Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and Rule 40.11 are best understood to not cover election event contracts, given the Commission's own stated doubt concerning whether  contracts involving 'gaming' include wagers on events that are not games of chance or even games.

## II. Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and the APA Require an Individualized Public-Interest Determination in This Proceeding.

If the Commission nevertheless determines that Rule 40.11 applies to election event contracts, then we believe it should interpret that Rule as giving it discretion to nonetheless approve them-an approval it should grant for the reasons detailed in Part III below.   Section 5c(c)(5)(C) and the APA are best understood as requiring case-by-case determinations by the Commission for contracts falling in the enumerated categories.  That means the Commission must  make  a  public-interest  determination  and  give  a  reasoned  explanation  for  such  a determination here.  This is especially true in light of the fact that the Commission has not yet determined whether gaming generally or Kalshi's contracts in particular are contrary to the public interest nor given a reasoned explanation for any such determination.

## A. Section 5c(c)(5)(C) Requires an Individualized Public-Interest Determination.

Under Section 5c(c)(5)(C), the Commission must decide whether contracts involving gaming  are  contrary  to  the  public  interest  on  a  case-by-case  basis.    The  statute  is  best understood to not permit a categorical determination that such contracts are always contrary to the public interest.

Start with the relevant text of Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i):

In connection with the listing of agreements, contracts, transactions, or swaps in  excluded  commodities  that  are  based  upon  the  occurrence,  extent  of  an occurrence,  or  contingency  …  by  a  designated  contract  market  or  swap execution  facility,  the  Commission  may  determine  that  such agreements, contracts, or transactions are contrary to the public interest if the agreements, contracts, or transactions involve … gaming.

7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i).  The Commission may make a public-interest determination only '[i]n connection with the listing of agreements, contracts, transactions, or swaps … by a' registered entity. Id. That is, the determination must be in response to a registered entity listing  a  contract  involving  gaming.    Moreover,  the  determination  applies  to  ' such agreements,  contracts,  or  transactions  …  if the agreements,  contracts,  or  transactions involve'  gaming. Id. (emphases  added).    When  used  as  an  adjective,  'such'  refers  to particular  things  already  mentioned. See  Such , Oxford  English  Dictionary , supra ('The previously described or specified; the (person or thing) before mentioned.'); Such , Black's Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) ('That or those; having just been mentioned').  The use of the definite article also indicates that the clause speaks of particular contracts, not contracts involving gaming generally.  And the verb 'determine' offers further support:  It carries an adjudicative connotation, suggesting a case-by-case decision. See Determine , Black's Law Dictionary , supra ('The act of deciding something officially; esp., a final decision by a court or administrative agency'); Determine , Oxford English Dictionary , supra ('To settle or decide (a dispute, question, matter in debate), as a judge or arbiter.').

Zooming  out,  the  sentence  structure  of  Section  5c(c)(5)(C)  would  be  awkward  and redundant if it was meant to refer to contracts involving gaming generally.  Had that been Congress's  intent,  it  could  simply  have  said,  'The  Commission  may  determine  that agreements, contracts, or transactions that are based on certain excluded commodities … are contrary to the public interest if they involve gaming.'

Moreover, another clause of Section 5c(c)(5)(C), which addresses the clearing of swaps, uses the same sentence structure to unambiguously require an individualized determination:

In connection with the listing of a swap for clearing by a derivatives clearing organization ,  the  Commission  shall determine ,  upon  request  or  on  its  own motion, the initial eligibility, or the continuing qualification, of a derivatives clearing organization to clear such a swap under those criteria, conditions, or rules that the Commission, in its discretion, determines.

7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(iii)(I) (emphases added).  A single derivatives clearing organization's 'initial eligibility' and 'continuing qualification' can only be individualized determinations. And the Commission's implementing regulation recognizes as much. See 17 C.F.R. § 39.5 (outlining process for reviewing swaps on an individualized basis).

In  addition,  Section  5c(c)(5)(C)(iv)'s  deadline  makes  sense  only  if  it  refers  to  an individualized determination.  'The Commission shall take final action under clauses (i) and (ii) in not later than 90 days from the commencement of its review unless the party seeking to offer the contract or swap agrees to an extension of this time limitation.'  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(iv) (emphases added).  This language is best understood as acknowledging that a determination under Section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i) concerns a specific contract brought by a specific party.   Thus, 'final action' under that provision cannot be the issuance of a rule of general applicability.  On top of that, a 90-day deadline is likely too short in the context of notice-andcomment  rulemaking.    For  instance,  two  hundred  sixty-seven  days  elapsed  between  the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) and the Final Rulemaking for Rule 40.11.

Finally, Rule 40.11 assumes that the Commission will determine the public interest on a case-by-case basis.  While Rule 40.11(a)(1) may seem like a categorical prohibition when read  in  isolation,  Rule  40.11(c)  provides  that  the  Commission  can  prohibit  a  contract involving gaming only after public notice and a 90-day review period.  That would be quite unnecessary if the Commission only needed to decide whether a contract involved gaming, which would be cut and dry in many cases. See infra Part III.A (discussing Rule 40.11(c) further).

But even if the statute could be read to empower the Commission to categorically prohibit every contract that 'involves' gaming, we submit it would exceed the statute's scope to  prohibit  every  contract  that  merely  'relates  to'  or  'references'  gaming.    17  C.F.R. 40.11(a)(1).    Section  5c(c)(5)(C)  allows  the  Commission  to  prohibit  only  contracts  that 'involve' gaming.  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i).  Rule 40.11 is best understood as staying within that statutory constraint and as not expanding the Commission's power beyond contracts 'involving' gaming, as detailed in Part I above.

## B. The  Commission  Has  Not  Yet  Made  an  Applicable  Public-Interest Determination.

Even if Section 5c(c)(5)(C) did not require an individualized public-interest determination,  we  respectfully  submit  that  the  Commission  should  make  one  here.    The Commission can ban contracts involving gaming only if it first determines that such contracts are 'contrary to the public interest.'  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i), (ii).  But the Commission has not yet made a public-interest determination that applies to Kalshi's contracts.

Nor did the Commission determine that gaming contracts are always contrary to the public interest when it issued Rule 40.11.  The text of Rule 40.11(a)(1) does not mention the public interest.  Neither did the NPRM, which said only that Section 5c(c)(5)(C) 'authorizes the Commission to prohibit' contracts involving gaming and that the Commission is acting '[p]ursuant  to  this  authority.'    75  Fed.  Reg.  67,282,  67,288-89  (Nov.  2,  2010).    The Commission did mention the public interest in the Final Rulemaking, where it said that it 'would  like  to  note  that  its  prohibition  of  certain  'gaming'  contracts  is  consistent  with Congress's intent to 'prevent gambling through the futures markets' and to 'protect the public interest from gaming and other events contracts.''  76 Fed. Reg. at 44,786 (quoting legislative history).  But this is not a determination by the Commission that gaming contracts violate the public interest.   It is  an observation that Congress has  found  gaming  contracts to  be contrary  to  the  public  interest  and  that  the  Commission  is  simply  complying  with  that finding.  Although we appreciate the Commission's desire to respect the will of Congress, Congress left it to 'the Commission' to 'determine' whether gaming contracts 'are contrary to  the  public  interest.'    7  U.S.C.  § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i).    But  finally  and  besides,  even  if  this discussion  did  amount  to  a  public-interest  finding,  as  discussed  above,  it  was  limited  to 'traditional  'gaming'  activity,'  which  does  not  include  election  event  contracts.    Final Rulemaking, 76 Fed. Reg. at 44,785; supra Part I.D.2.

Appropriately, the Commission did make an individualized public-interest determination in its Nadex Order.  Slip op. at 4.  But that finding by its terms was limited to 'the Political Event Contracts,' id. ,  the defined term the Commission used for the specific contracts Nadex had proposed in that proceeding, id. at  1.    Naturally,  the  Commission's finding was also based on the specific facts and arguments presented in that proceeding, which  are  not  identical  to  the  ones  presented  here.    Accordingly,  if  the  Commission determines  that  Kalshi's  contracts  involve  gaming-which,  as  discussed  above,  would  be contrary to the ordinary meaning of both 'involve' and 'gaming'-we believe it should also make an individualized public-interest finding to conform to the requirements of Section 5c(c)(5)(C).

## C. The  Commission  Has  Not  Yet  Explained  Any  Applicable  PublicInterest Finding.

For  similar  reasons,  we  believe  the  Commission  should  make  a  public-interest determination here to conform to the APA.  The APA requires agencies to give reasoned explanations for their decisions.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The Commission has not yet given a reasoned  explanation  on  whether  Kalshi's  contracts  or  gaming  contracts  generally  are contrary to the public interest.  To the contrary, the Commission acknowledged that it would 'continue[] to consider' whether contracts involving events that are not 'traditional 'gaming' activities' should be banned at all.  Final Rulemaking, 76 Fed. Reg. at 44,785.

In addition, the APA requires the Commission 'to appreciate the full scope of [its] discretion' when making decisions. See DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. , 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1911 (2020).  When issuing Rule 40.11, the Commission appeared to believe that Congress had already determined that gaming contracts are contrary to the public interest. Supra Part II.B.  We believe the Commission should acknowledge its discretion (and obligation) to make its own public-interest determination and exercise it.

Moreover, even setting aside the text of Section 5c(c)(5)(C), we do not believe the legislative  history  of  that  provision  justifies  a  determination  that  gaming  contracts  are contrary to the public interest.  The Final Rulemaking discerned Congress's intent from a single  colloquy  by  two Senators.    Final  Rulemaking, 76 Fed. Reg.  at 44,786 &amp;  nn. 34-35 (citing 156 Cong. Rec. S5906-07 (daily ed. July 15, 2010) (statements of Sens. Lincoln and Feinstein)).  But Congress does not speak authoritatively through legislative history, only through duly enacted statutes. Allina Health Servs. ,  139 S. Ct. at 1814.  And even when courts consult legislative history, they accept only 'clear evidence of congressional intent.' Milner v. Dep't of Navy , 562 U.S. 562, 572 (2011).  Floor statements by individual Senators are not enough.  Such statements 'rank among the least illuminating forms of legislative history.' NLRB v. SW Gen., Inc. ,  137  S.  Ct.  929,  943  (2017); accord Advoc. Health Care Network v. Stapleton , 137 S. Ct. 1652, 1661 (2017).

## III. Election Event Contracts Promote the Public Interest.

If the Commission determines that Kalshi's contracts involve gaming, we submit that the Commission retains the discretion to find that they are not contrary to the public interest. It should exercise that discretion to approve them.

## A. Rule 40.11 Permits the Commission to Consider the Public Interest Here.

Nothing  in  the  CEA  or  the  Commission's  regulations  prohibit  it  from  approving individual contracts that fall within Rule 40.11(a).  Rule 40.11(a) forbids a 'registered entity' to 'list' for trading a contract that involves gaming (emphasis added).  It says nothing about what the Commission can do.  Rule 40.11(c) requires the Commission to 'issue an order approving or disapproving' the contract by the end of the 90-day review period.  But it does not identify the standard by which the Commission must approve or disapprove requests or otherwise limit the Commission's discretion in any other way.  Thus, nothing in Rule 40.11 prevents the Commission from approving a contract involving gaming on the ground that the contract is consistent with the public interest.  Nor does any provision of the CEA.  To the contrary, the Act requires the Commission to determine the public interest on a case-by-case basis.  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i); supra Part II.A.

## B. The Predictive Value of Election Event Contracts Serves the Public Interest.

As the Commission recognized in its Nadex Order, the public-interest standard is not limited to the narrow question of whether a contract satisfies the economic purpose test.  Slip op. at 4.  Despite recognizing this general principle, the Commission has not yet publicly considered  the  benefits  of  election  event  contracts  beyond  whether  it  has  an  economic purpose.  Such contracts have a separate and unique benefit to the public-they provide a mechanism for accurately predicting election results.

An academic study of the Iowa Electronic Markets found that the markets have 'no obvious biases' in forecasting election results and have 'considerable accuracy.' J. Berg et al., Results  from  a  Dozen  Years  of  Election  Futures  Markets  Research , in 1 Handbook of Experimental Economics Results 742, 746 (Charles R. Plott &amp; Vernon L. Smith eds., 2008). The  Iowa  Markets  consistently  outperform  conventional  polls,  predicting  presidential election results within 1.5%, compared to 1.9% on average for polls. Id. The Iowa Markets are also 'more stable than polls over the course of election campaigns.' Id. at 747.  And their prices 'do not follow poll results'; rather, they 'predict changes in polls.' Id. at 749.

More accurate predictions promote the public interest.  Accurate information about the  future  is  as  vital  to  politics  as  to  business.    Politicians  and  the  public  both  rely  on predictions  about  elections  in  the  form  of  polls  and  expert  commentary  to  shape  their behavior.  Politicians use this information to understand whether their message is resonating with the public and to reshape it as needed.  The public uses this information to know what candidates and events are worth paying attention to, and to make decisions as to how to most effectively allocate scarce resources.  By providing more accurate predictions, election event contracts  can  only  improve  our  democracy.    The  CEA  recognizes that  commodity  futures trading serves the 'national public interest by providing a means for … discovering prices' and 'disseminating pricing information through trading.'  7 U.S.C. § 5(a).  Election events contracts provide an analogous public benefit in the political arena, in addition to the price discovery benefits discussed below.

Election event contracts can be particularly useful in down-ballot races and for less established candidates.  National polling firms are less likely to conduct polls for district level and local races.  Whatever polling is conducted is less accurate, and campaigns have to spend money to conduct internal polling  that is not released to the public.   According  to academic researchers, election prediction markets remain 'extremely accurate' even at the district level.  J. Wolfers &amp; E. Zitzewitz, Prediction Markets , 18 J. of Econ. Perspectives 107, 112 (2004).  Election event contracts would thus allow the public and candidates with lower levels of funding to have accurate predictions in races that would otherwise be neglected. Democratizing  the  availability  of  accurate  predictive  information  for  less  well-funded candidates and races in smaller markets serves the ends of democracy by helping to level the playing field for these otherwise marginalized candidates and races.

Election prediction markets promote democratic values and expand participation in our  democracy  in  additional  ways.    To  obtain  analysis  of  future  election  results  today, members of the public largely have to rely on polls conducted by a small number of elite firms and a small class of expert commentators in the media.  If election event contracts were to become more widespread, ordinary members of the public would be able to improve political discourse and learn from their fellow citizens through participation in prediction markets. Election event contracts have the power to harness the wisdom of the crowd and to open up a new avenue of political participation that would not otherwise exist.

The Commission's rationale in Nadex for concluding that the contracts at issue there harmed the public interest was that those contracts could create 'monetary incentives to vote for particular candidates even when such a vote may be contrary to the voter's political view of such candidates.'  Slip op. at 4.  Naturally, this would be concerning if it took place on a large scale, but it seems unlikely to occur in any given case.  The effect of a single vote on any election is negligible, so any financial incentive to vote against one's political views would likewise be negligible.  And to the extent someone tried to guarantee a favorable outcome on a contract by buying the votes of others, that would be a crime under federal law.  18 U.S.C. § 597.

## C. Election Event Contracts Pass the Economic Purpose Test.

In  any  event,  election  event  contracts  serve  the  public  interest  even  under  the economic purpose test.  In Nadex , the Commission asserted that 'the unpredictability of the specific economic consequences of an election means that' the contracts Nadex had proposed 'cannot reasonably be expected to be used for hedging purposes.'  Slip op. at 3.  But the Commission did not explain its reasoning on this point, and there are good reasons to think otherwise.

First, on an intuitive level, it is easy to see how even one election result can have significant economic consequences for certain firms and individuals. (Many individuals have commented in this proceeding identifying consequences of elections against which election event contracts would allow them to hedge. See, e.g. , Comment of Ian W., No. 69730 (Sept. 22, 2022) (explaining that Congress this term 'was literally *one vote* away from changing the capital gains tax treatment' that applied to him); Comment of Valentin Perez, No.  69725 (Sept. 21, 2022) (as a small business owner, taxes and immigration policy); Comment of Jacob Faircloth, No. 69683 (Sept. 13, 2022) (explaining that the SALT deduction is unlikely to be fully restored in the near future  unless  the  Democrats  control  Congress);  Comment  of  Mike  Ee,  No.  69681  (Sept.  12,  2022) (explaining that changes to Medicare funding would affect the income of his wife, who works at a hospital);  Comment  of  Amir  K.  Kaushik,  No.  69656  (Sept.  5,  2022)  (as  an  international  student, immigration policy).)   Although there are many elected officials in America, much of the law governing business today comes in the form  of  regulations  issued  by  administrative  agencies.    Administrative  agencies  largely answer to  one person:  the  President.    Presidential  candidates  can  have  starkly  different positions  on  how  certain  industries  should  be  regulated,  meaning  the  outcome  of  the presidential election can have significant financial consequences for firms in those industries. Control  of  Congress,  the  subject  of  Kalshi's  proposed  contracts,  has  similarly  observable consequences.  Which party controls Congress after the midterms will determine whether the country will have a united or divided government for the next two years, and economically significant legislation favored by one of the two major parties is much more likely to pass under a united government.  And on many issues, the major parties have clear differences in their platforms that party leaders ensure are followed once they are in power, so one can often foresee the sorts of policies a united government will enact into law.

Second, there is concrete empirical evidence of the economic impact of elections.  One study, for instance, examined the equity prices of 41 firms whose activities would be favored under the policy platforms of George W. Bush and 21 firms favored under those of Al Gore in the wake of the 2000 presidential election.  Brian Knight, Are Policy Platforms Capitalized into Equity Prices?  Evidence from the Bush/Gore 2000 Presidential Election 2 (Nat'l Bureau of Econ. Res., Working Paper No. 10,333, 2004).  The study found a statistically significant effect: on average, the value of Bush-favored firms was 3% higher than they would have been under a Gore administration, while the value of Gore-favored firms was 6% lower. Id. at 910.  The difference was more pronounced in industries where the difference in the candidates' policy views was greater.  Tobacco firms, for instance, were worth 13% more under Bush relative to Gore. Id. at 11.  For firms sensitive to regulation in areas where candidates have significant  policy  disagreement,  election  event  contracts  would  easily  be  able  to  serve  a hedging function.

We  again  thank  the  Commission  for  seeking  public  input  on  these  important questions.  We urge the Commission to approve Kalshi's proposed contracts because they do not involve gaming and are not contrary to the public interest.
