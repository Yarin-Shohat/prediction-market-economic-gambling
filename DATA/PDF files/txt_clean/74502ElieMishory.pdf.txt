## STOCK INDEX FUTURES
## CLAYTON  YEUTTER

GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO ADDRESS THIS GROUP. LAST YEAR, WHEN I TALKED  TO YOU AT  THE SCIA  ANNUAL  MEETING IN BURGENSTOCK, I TOLD YOU OF THE DYNAMIC GROWTH THE FUTURES INDUSTRY WAS UNDERGOING. I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THAT GROWTH CONTINUED  IN  1983. THE  CHICAGO  MERCANTILE  EXCHANGE  HAD  ITS  SEVENTH CONSECUTIVE RECORD-BREAKING YEAR, TOPPING 1982 TRADING VOLUME BY MORE THAN 13  PER  CENT. SINCE  1972  WE HAVE SEEN OUR  ANNUAL VOLUME GROW FROM  4.5  MILLION  CONTRACTS  TO  38.1  MILLION  CONTRACTS--A  TRULY PHENOMENAL  RECORD!

I ALSO  TOLD  YOU ABOUT  AN EXCITING  NEW FUTURES INSTRUMENT  THAT HAS PACED OUR GROWTH--THE STANDARD AND POOR'S 500 STOCK INDEX FUTURES. WE NOW HAVE A "FAMILY" OF STOCK INDEX PRODUCTS WHICH INCLUDES  S&P  500  FUTURES, BEING  USED  BY  MORE  AND  MORE  INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS 1 S&P 100 FUTURES, AIMED PRIMARILY AT THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTOR; AND S&P 500  OPTIONS,  WHICH  GIVES INSTITUTIONAL  USERS THE CHANCE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN OPTIONS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS FOR RI SK PROTECTION. WE WILL SOON ADD AN S&P ENERGY SUB-INDEX (AND OTHER SUB-INDICES  LATER) GIVING  OUR  EXCHANGE AN EXTENSIVE  RANGE OF THESE VALUABLE NEW INVESTMENT TOOLS. OUR S&P PRODUCTS NOW ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY  70  PER  CENT  OF  INDUSTRY-WIDE  STOCK INDEX  VOLUME.

IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, S&P 500 FUTURES HAVE BECOME ONE OF FIVE  MOST HEAVILY USED FUTURES PRODUCTS. AND VOLUME CONTINUES TO GROW  ASTRONOMICALLY. IT  TYPICALLY  TAKES ABOUT FOUR  YEARS BEFORE A FUTURES INSTRUMENT REACHES AN ANNUAL VOLUME OF THREE MILLION CONTRACTS. WITH THE S&P 500  -LAUNCHED IN  APRIL  1982  -VOLUME

CLAYTON YEUTTER IS  PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER  OF THE  CHICAGO  MERCANTILE  EXCHANGE. HE IS  A  FORMER  ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE AND SERVED AS DEPUTY SPECIAL TRADE REPRESENTATIVE  DURING  THE  FORD  ADMINISTRATION.

FOR THE FIRST FULL YEAR WAS MORE THAN EIGHT MILLION CONTRACTS. CLEARLY, STOCK INDEX INSTRUMENTS ARE ONE OF THIS INDUSTRY'S  ALL TIME  SUCCESS  STORIES.

I  THOUGHT  IT  MIGHT  BE  HELPFUL  TODAY IF  I  WERE  TO  DESCRIBE  THIS NEW INVESTMENT TOOL IN MORE DETAIL AND TELL YOU HOW IT IS BEING USED TO TRANSF"ER INVESTMENT RISK. EACH DAY WE HEAR REPORTS OF OTHER FUTURES EXCHANGES AROUND THE WORLD WHO PLAN TO INTRODUCE STOCK INDEX FUTURES--HERE IN EUROPE, IN THE FAR EAST, AND EVEN IN LATIN AMERICA. THOUGH THESE PROPOSED NEW CONTRACTS ARE DESTINED TO SPREAD STOCK INDEX FUTURES WORLDWIDE, I MUST CONFESS THAT FUTURES CONTRACTS ARE PROBABLY THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD OF ALL FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS. THE STEREOTYPE OF A  FUTURES EXCHANGE IS  A MARKETPLACE  WHERE  ONLY SPECULATION  OCCURS AND ·WILD-EYED  GAMBLERS· DRIVE  PRICES  UP  AND  DOWN.

NOTHING COULD BE MORE FALLACIOUS. FUTURES MARKETS DO NOT CREATE RISK. THEY MERELY TRANSFER IT FROM INVESTORS, BUSINESSMEN, AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS AND BANKERS TO PROFESSIONAL TRADERS  WHO ARE  WILLING  TO ACCEPT THAT RISK IN THE HOPE OF MAKING SUBSTANTIAL PROFITS. THIS IS THE VITAL ECONOMIC FUNCTION OF FUTURES  MARKET. IT  IS  WHAT  THEY  ARE  ALL  ABOUT.

UNTIL  1972,  THIS  TRANSFERRAL  OF  RISK  WAS  AVAILABLE  ONLY IN  THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. BUT IN THAT YEAR THE CHICAGO MERCANTILE EXCHANGE  LAUNCHED  THE ERA  OF  FINANCIAL FUTURES  WITH  TRADING IN  THE INTERNATIONAL  CURRENCIES. AS  A  CONSEQUENCE, IT  IS  NOW POSSIBLE  TO TRANSFER INTEREST RATE RISK, EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND, WITH STOCK INDEX  FUTURES, STOCK  PORTFOLIO  RISK  TO  THOSE  WILLING  TO  ACCEPT  IT.

WITH THE ADVENT OF ENORMOUS STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE 19706,  THE VULNERABILITY  OF INSTITUTIONAL PORTFOLIOS BECAME QUITE APPARENT  TO  INVESTMENT  MANAGERS. THIS  MADE THE S&P 500 ESPECIALLY ATTRACTIVE  WHEN IT  BECAME AVAILABLE. IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS, S&P FUTURES HAVE BECOME A MAJOR NEW TOOL IN EQUITY PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT.

THE MARKETPLACE IS STILL THE BEST PROVING GROUND FOR A NEW PRODUCT, SO LET'S  LOOK AT SOME OF THE USERS OF THESE INSTRUMENTS AND  THE  STRATEGIES  THEY  HAVE  DEVELOPED.

SEVERAL LARGE CORPORATE PENSION FUNDS, INCLUDING EXXON AND WESTINGHOUSE  ELECTRIC  USE  STOCK INDEX FUTURES AS HEDGING  VEHICLES. HARVARD  UNIVERSITY  USES  THEM IN  THE  MANAGEMENT  OF  THE  VARIOUS FUNDS IT CONTROLS. THE UNIVERSITY HAS FOUND THAT IT CAN REDUCE THE MARKET  RISK  ASSOCIATED  WITH LARGE ENDOWMENTS  AND INCREASE THE RATE OF RETURN ON ITS INVESTMENTS. THE PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY USES STOCK INDEX FUTURES IN THE MANAGEMENT  OF  THE PRUDENTIAL BACHE OPTION GROWTH FUND. TRAVELERS INSURANCE AND CITIBANK USE STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO ASSIST IN THE MARKET TIMING OF THEIR INVESTMENT FUNDS.

LET'S  WALK THROUGH A  HYPOTHETICAL CASE WHERE A  MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION WANTS TO USE STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO HEDGE ITS STOCK PORTFOLIO. LET US SAY THAT THE CORPORATION HAS A TWO MILLION DOLLAR  DIVERSIFIED  PORTFOLIO  OF  STOCKS  THAT  CORRELATES  CLOSELY  WITH THE  GENERAL  MARKET. THE  PORTFOLIO  MANAGER BELIEVES  THE MARKET MAY BE VULNERABLE TO A  DECLINE AND WISHES TO PROTECT HIMSELF WITHOUT

HAVING TO SELL INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES. WHEN THE S&P 500 INDEX IS PRICED  AT  160.00,  HE  DECIDES  TO  HEDGE  TWO-THIRDS  OF  HIS  PORTFOLIO  BY SELLING SEVENTEEN S&P 500 FUTURES CONTRACTS WHICH ARE TRADING AT 160.40. WHEN  THE  S&P INDEX  THEN FALLS  FROM  160.00  TO  150.00  AND  THE FUTURES  CONTRACT  FALLS  FROM  160.40  TO  150.10,  HE  WILL  CLOSE  OUT  HIS POSITION. BY  HEDGING, HE  HAS  LIMITED  THE  DECLINE  IN  HIS  PORTFOLIO'S VALUE TO 1.8  PERCENT. HAD HE NOT HEDGED, THE DECLINE  WOULD HAVE BEEN  6.25  PERCENT. AND  HAD  HE  DECIDED  TO  HEDGE  HIS  ENTIRE  PORTFOLIO INSTEAD OF TWO-THIRDS, HIS DECLINE WOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY ELIMINATED. IN  FACT, HE  WOULD  HAVE  PROFITED  BY  $3,750.

OF COURSE THERE ARE A  NUMBER  OF  OTHER  STRATEGIES  THAT CAN BE DEVELOPED AROUND STOCK INDEX FUTURES. FOR EXAMPLE, THEY CAN BE USED  TO  SHIFT  THE  MIX  OF  AN  EQUITY  PORTFOLIO. THEY  CAN  BE  EMPLOYED TO CAPTURE A  RISK-FREE RETURN WHILE HOLDING ON TO EQUITIES. THE CME MARKETING DEPARTMENT CONSTANTLY HEARS OF NEW STRATEGIES THAT THE  MARKETPLACE  HAS  DEVISED  FOR  THESE  CONTRACTS.

YOU'LL REMEMBER THAT I REFERRED EARLIER TO THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTION  THAT  FUTURES  MARKETS  ARE  GAMBLING  DENS  POPULATED  ONLY BY  SPECULATORS. NOW  OBVIOUSLY, THE SPECULATOR  IS  A  VERY IMPORTANT PART  OF  THE  MARKET. WITHOUT  THE  SPECULATOR--WHETHER  HE  BE  A  FLOOR TRADER  OR  AN  OUTSIDE  CUSTOMER--THE  MARKETS  WOULD  HAVE  NO  LIQUIDITY. WITHOUT  LIQUIDITY,  THE  MARKETS  WOULD  DRY  UP  AND  DISAPPEAR. SO,  THE SPECULATOR  IS  IMPORTANT.

BUT WHEN YOU CONSIDER  WHAT I'VE  JUST BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT LARGE INSTITUTIONAL USE OF OUR MARKETS AND THE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, YOU REALIZE THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS LEGITIMATE HEDGING APPLICATIONS FOR FUTURES MARKETS. TYPICALLY, WHEN WE INTRODUCE A  NEW CONTRACT THE MARKET IS FIRST USED BY BLOCK TRADERS AND THE SPECULATOR  UNTIL  VOLUME BUILDS TO A CERTAIN LEVEL. THEN AS BANKS, CORPORATIONS, PORTFOLIO MANAGERS, INVESTORS AND OTHER  MARKET PARTICIPANTS LEARN HOW TO USE THE NEW CONTRACT, THE HEDGER COMES IN. ONLY THEN DOES A MARKET TAKE OFF--THE  WAY  THE  S&P  500  HAS -TAKEN  OFF,FOR  EXAMPLE.

OBVIOUSLY, WE SEE A  BRIGHT FUTURE FOR STOCK INDEX PRODUCTS. S&P 500 FUTURES COULD SOON BE THE NUMBER ONE FUTURES CONTRACT IN OUR  INDUSTRY. THE S&P 100  IS  DOING  WELL, AND S&P  500  OPTIONS  SEEM READY TO ADVANCE TO HIGHER TRADING LEVELS. AND NEW SUB-INDICES WILL  PERMIT  INVESTORS  A  MUCH  WIDER  RANGE  OF  STRATEGIES. THAT'S  THE BEAUTY  OF  STOCK INDEX  PRODUCTS--AS  WE  LAUNCH  NEW  PRODUCTS,  WE  BRING NEW BUSINESS TO ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE INDEX AND OPTION -FAMILY.-

IF  ONE LOOKS AT THE  NUMBER  OF  POTENTIAL  USERS OF STOCK INDEX FUTURES, THE NECESSARY CONCLUSION IS THAT POTENTIAL GROWTH IS VIRTUALLY UNLIMITED. SOME STUDIES INDICATE THAT THERE ARE ABOUT 350,000  PERSONS  WHO  ACTIVELY  USE  FUTURES  MARKETS. THIS  COMPARES  TO ABOUT 35 MILLION PERSONS WHO HOLD ·SECURITIES. STOCK INDEXES OBVIOUSLY ARE A  REVOLUTIONARY NEW PRODUCT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SPUR  GROWTH IN  FUTURES  MARKETS FOR  MANY YEARS  TO  COME.

CERTAINLY,  WE  AT  THE  CHICAGO  MERCANTILE  EXCHANGE  SEE  THESE  AND OTHER  INDEX FUTURES  AS  A  STRONG  FACTOR  IN  OUR  ONGOING  PLANS  FOR  THE YEARS  AHEAD.
