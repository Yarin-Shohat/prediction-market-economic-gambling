I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposal to ban election contracts and prediction markets. Instead of an outright ban, I believe there should be a robust regulatory framework to ensure these markets operate safely and transparently within the United States.

Banning election markets risks pushing this valuable activity to offshore and unregulated platforms, where there is no consumer protection or oversight. This could lead to increased risks of fraud and market manipulation, undermining the very integrity the ban seeks to protect.

Proper regulation can address potential concerns while preserving the benefits these markets offer. Prediction markets provide valuable insights into public sentiment and can serve as important tools for hedging against political risks. By establishing clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms, the CFTC can ensure that these markets contribute positively to the financial ecosystem.

I urge the CFTC to reconsider its proposal and focus on developing a regulatory framework that allows election markets to operate legally and effectively. This approach would support innovation, enhance market efficiency, and protect participants, ensuring that the U.S. remains a leader in financial market innovation.
