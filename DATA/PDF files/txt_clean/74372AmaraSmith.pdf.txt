I want to take the time to highlight former Senator Blanche Lincoln's comment. It is important. In particular I want to submit for comment this portion of her comment:

I am deeply troubled by the recent proposal put forth by the CFTC, the federal agency that is tasked with administering the CEA. In prohibiting broad categories of contracts, the CFTC's proposal relies heavily on a 2010 Senate colloquy between me and the late Senator Feinstein for support. But the CFTC proposal goes well beyond what we intended. This heavy-handed proposal to ban markets, rather than regulating them, risks undermining the core principles that underpin our financial markets - principles we strived to uphold through carefully crafted legislation that encourages innovation and provides consumer protections.
