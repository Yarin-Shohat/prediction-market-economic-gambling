SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 10, 2024, the Commission approved proposed amendments to its rules concerning event contracts in certain excluded commodities. (See ''CFTC to Hold a Commission Open Meeting May 10,'' CFTC Rel. No. 8906-24, available at https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/ 8906-24.) The proposed amendments would further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of section 5c(c)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (''CEA'') and are contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity. Among other things, the proposed amendments would further specify the types of event contracts that involve ''gaming.'' In addition, the proposed amendments would further align the language of the Commission's event contract rules with the statutory text of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C), and make certain technical changes to the rules in order to enhance clarity and organization.

The NPRM was published on the Commission's website on May 10, 2024, and was made available for public comment through July 9, 2024, for a total comment period of 60 days.

The Commission is extending the comment period by an additional thirty days, until August 8, 2024, in order to allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposal and prepare their comments.

Issued in Washington, DC, on June 27, 2024, by the Commission.

## SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Withdrawal of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Termination of Rulemaking Proceeding

1. On January 19, 2021, the Commission issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) proposing to revise its regulations regarding the Electric Reliability Organization's (ERO) performance assessments pursuant to section 215 of the Federal Power Act (FPA). (Revisions to Regulations on Elec. Reliability Org. Performance Assessments, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 86 FR 7518 (Jan. 29, 2021), 174 FERC ¶61,031 (2021).) The Commission received seven comments in response to the NOPR. (The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Regional Entities, jointly; the Western Interconnection Regional Advisory Body (WIRAB); the ISO/RTO Council; the American Public Power Association, Edison Electric Institute, Electric Power Supply Association, the Large Public Power Council, National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, and Transmission Access Policy Study Group, jointly (Joint Trade Associations); Public Citizen, Inc. (Public Citizen); and the Foundation for Resilient Societies (Resilient Societies).) After reviewing the comments received, the Commission has decided to retain its existing regulations regarding the ERO's performance assessments. For the reasons set forth below, we are exercising our discretion to withdraw the NOPR and terminate this rulemaking proceeding.

## I. Background

A. Commission Regulations on the ERO Performance Assessment

2. Section 215 of the FPA requires the Commission to issue regulations that, among other things, provide for the certification of an entity as the ERO if it meets certain criteria. (16 U.S.C. 824o.) On February 3, 2006, the Commission issued Order No. 672, which amended the Commission's regulations to implement the requirements of FPA section 215. (Rules Concerning Certification of the Elec. Reliability Org.; and Procedures for the Establishment, Approval, and Enforcement of Elec. Reliability Standards, Order No. 672, 71 FR 8662 (Feb. 17, 2006), 114 FERC ¶ 61,104, at P 186, order on reh'g, Order No. 672-A, 114 FERC ¶61,328 (2006).) The specific requirements for the ERO performance assessments are set out in the Commission's regulations in §39.3(c). (18 CFR 39.3(c) (2023).) On July 20, 2006, the Commission certified NERC as the ERO. (N. Am. Elec. Reliability Corp., 116 FERC ¶61,062, order on reh'g and compliance, 117 FERC ¶61,126 (2006), aff'd sub nom. Alcoa Inc. v. FERC,)

## B. NOPR

3. In its NOPR, the Commission proposed to amend its regulations regarding the ERO performance assessments. First, the Commission proposed to require the ERO to submit assessments of its performance every three years instead of every five years. Second, the Commission proposed to add a requirement for the ERO to include in its performance assessment a detailed discussion of any areas of the ERO's responsibilities and activities, or a Regional Entity's delegated functions, beyond those required by the Commission's regulations, that the Commission has identified at least 90 days prior to the expected performance assessment submission date. Finally, the Commission proposed to formalize the method for the ERO and Regional Entities to receive and respond to recommendations by the users, owners, and operators of the Bulk-Power System, and other interested parties for improvement of the ERO's operations, activities, oversight, and procedures.

4. The Commission explained in the NOPR that it believed that the proposals would provide better continuity in its review of the ERO's operations, activities, oversight, procedures, and evaluation of the effectiveness of each Regional Entity in the performance of delegated functions. Further, the Commission explained that shorter performance assessment cycles could provide an opportunity for timelier identification and implementation of potential improvements to ERO performance and improve the efficiency of the overall performance assessment process. (NOPR, 174 FERC ¶61,031 at P 1.)

5. Notice of the NOPR was published in the Federal Register , 86 FR 7518 (Jan. 29, 2021), with comments due by March 1, 2021.

## C. Comments

6. In their joint comments, NERC and the Regional Entities oppose all proposed modifications. They assert that the proposed changes would place undue burden on ERO staff by directing their focus away from key activities that ''would outweigh any potential benefits.'' (NERC and Regional Entities Joint Comments at 2.) They explain that the existing five-year performance assessment cycle provides ''greater opportunity to demonstrate evolution of 564 F.3d 1342 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (ERO Certification Order) (certifying NERC as the ERO responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory Reliability Standards).
