Commodity Futures Trading Commission,

MOTION OF PROFESSOR JOSEPH A. GRUNDFEST FOR LEAVE TO FILE BRIEF AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Professor Joseph A. Grundfest respectfully files this unopposed motion for leave to file a brief as amicus curiae in support of Plaintiff KalshiEx LLC's motion for summary judgment.

Under Local Rule 7(o)(1), a proposed amicus brief 'may file a brief only upon leave of Court.'  Under Local Rule 7(o)(2), a 'motion for leave to file an amicus brief shall concisely state the nature of the movant's interest; identify the party or parties supported, if any; and set forth the reasons why an amicus brief is desirable, why the movant's position is not adequately represented by a party, and why the matters asserted are relevant to the disposition of the case.'

Movant's interest . Professor Joseph A. Grundfest is the W.A. Franke Professor of Law and Business, Emeritus, and Senior Faculty, Rock Center for Corporate Governance, at Stanford Law School.  Professor Grundfest is a nationally prominent expert on capital markets, corporate governance, and securities litigation. Before joining the Stanford Law School faculty in 1990, Professor Grundfest was a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission and served on the staff of the President's Council of Economic Advisors as counsel and senior economist for legal and regulatory matters.

Professor  Grundfest  has  expertise  specific  to  the  operation  of  derivatives  markets  and statutory construction, the primary subject matters of this dispute.  He holds U.S. Patent 8,452,620 B1, Parametric Directors and Officers Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts, and related Financial Instruments  (granted  May  28,  2013),  which  describes  the  construction  of  novel  derivatives products  and  markets  related  to  the  outcome  of  litigation  events.    While  serving  as  an  SEC Commissioner  he  was  actively  involved  in  legislative  and  regulatory  matters  related  to  the evolution of stock market-based futures and other derivative products.  His scholarship explores various  aspects  of  derivatives  analytics,  including  a Yale  Law  Review article (Joseph A. Grundfest, The Limited Future of Unlimited Liability: A Capital Markets Perspective , 102 Yale L.J. 387 (1992).) explaining  how derivative instruments could be used to avoid pass-through stockholder liability, and a Stanford Law Review article describing how litigation can be modeled as a derivative-more precisely, a real option. (Joseph A. Grundfest &amp; Peter H. Huang, The Unexpected Value of Litigation: A Real Options Perspective , 58 Stan. L. Rev. 1267 (2006).) He has also taught about the design and operation of derivative markets, particularly in connection with the financial crisis of 2008-2009.

Professor Grundfest, with other professors, submitted a comment letter to the CFTC in the underlying administrative proceeding urging the CFTC to permit Kalshi to list the proposed event contracts.  Professor Grundfest respectfully disagrees with the CFTC's order and has an interest in explaining to this Court why that order should be overturned.

As for statutory interpretation, one of Professor Grundfest's Harvard Law Review articles describes a novel form of regulatory constraint and demonstrates the interpretation's consistency with  statutory  text  and  legislative  intent. (Joseph A. Grundfest, Disimplying Private Rights of Action Under the Federal Securities Laws: The Commission's Authority , 107 Harv. L. Rev. 961 (1994).) Another Stanford  Law  Review article  describes  the strategic  use  of  textual  ambiguities  as  a  mechanism  that  supports  legislative  compromise  and describes the judicial response to the ensuing interpretive challenges. (Joseph A. Grundfest &amp; A.C. Pritchard, Statutes with Multiple Personality Disorders: The Value of Ambiguity in Statutory Design and Interpretation , 54 Stan. L. Rev. 627 (2002).) A recent Business Lawyer article addresses the interaction of federal and state law, and the 'narrow interpretation' doctrine that is applied to certain forms of securities fraud litigation. (Joseph A. Grundfest, The Limits of Delaware Corporate Law: Internal Affairs, Federal Forum Provisions, and Sciabacucchi, 75 Bus. Law. 1319 (2020).)

Why an amicus brief is desirable and relevant .  Although KalshiEx is undoubtedly well represented, Professor Grundfest's proposed amicus brief is still desirable and relevant.  Professor Grundfest's experience and scholarship relating to the operation and regulation of these markets gives him a perspective that is difficult for other counsel and amici to replicate.

'Even when a party is very well represented, an amicus may provide important assistance to the court.' Neonatology Assocs., P.A. v. Commissioner , 293 F.3d 128, 132 (3d Cir. 2002) (Alito, J.).  'Some friends of the court are entities with particular expertise not possessed by any party to the case. Others argue points deemed too far-reaching for emphasis by a party intent on winning a particular case. Still others explain the impact a potential holding might have on an industry or other  group.' Id. (quotation  marks  omitted); see  Arias  v.  Dyncorp ,  No.  01-1908,  2011  WL 13377371, at *1 (D.D.C. Nov. 21, 2011) (granting law professors' motion for leave to file amicus brief and citing Neonatology ).

As explained above, Professor Grundfest has 'particular expertise' in this matter.  Further, his reasoning as an amicus extends beyond KalshiEx's arguments: while KalshiEx's arguments are understandably tailored to the particular event contracts it seeks to list, Professor Grundfest's proposed amicus brief explains how the CFTC's reasoning jeopardizes all event contracts.   For the same reason, Professor Grundfest's brief will help the Court because it explains the broader impact of the CFTC's order.

Courts in this District frequently grant motions for leave to file amicus briefs, see, e.g. , Asylum Seekers Trying to Assure their Safety v. Lechleitner , No. 23-cv-163, 2023 WL 8619411, at *3 (D.D.C. Dec. 13, 2023); United States v. Sutton , Crim. No. 21-0598, 2023 WL 3478484, at *2 (D.D.C. May 16, 2023), including motions for leave to file amicus briefs by law professors. See Arias ,  2011 WL 13377371, at *1 (granting law professors' motion for leave to file amicus brief because proposed brief presented 'legal analysis offered by legal scholars' (quotation marks omitted)); Wilderness Soc'y v. Trump, No. 17-cv-02587, 2019 WL 11556601, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 20, 2019).  The Court should follow that authority and grant Professor Grundfest's motion for leave.

## STATEMENT OF INTEREST (Pursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  29(a)(4)(E)  and  D.D.C.

Professor Grundfest respectfully disagrees with the CFTC's order and has an interest in explaining to this Court why that order should be overturned.

## SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

The CFTC erred in holding that political event contracts 'involve gaming.'  'Gaming' refers to playing games, like roulette or the slots, or betting on the outcome of games, such as the Super Bowl.  But elections are not 'games' as that term is used in the statute.  The CFTC failed to apply the appropriate canons of statutory construction when it reasoned that, because an election is a type of 'contest,' participating in political event prediction markets must be 'gaming.'  That logic leads to irrational and unsustainable interpretations of the statute.  The CFTC's policy views on  prediction  markets,  whatever  their  merit,  do  not  authorize  the  CFTC  to  take  statutory interpretation  into  its  own  hands.  The  Supreme  Court  is  currently  considering  two  cases  that challenge the extent of deference that courts owe to agency interpretations of the statutes they administer. (Relentless, Inc. v. Dep't of Com. , 144 S. Ct. 325 (2023) (mem.) (granting cert on question whether the Court should overrule Chevron ); Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo , 143 S. Ct. 2429 (2023) (mem.) (same).) But  whatever  the  outcome  of  those  pending  cases,  the  CFTC's  interpretation  of 'gaming' is so irreconcilable with the statute's plain text and purpose that it clearly cannot stand.

The CFTC's public-interest analysis is also fatally flawed.  The proposed contracts serve an empirically supportable hedging function, and the CFTC's analysis of the utility of hedging was far  too  narrow.    It  also  failed  to  recognize  the  non-economic  benefits  of  prediction  markets. Finally,  the  CFTC  concluded  that  KalshiEX's  prediction  markets  might  lead  to  election manipulation, but it failed to explain why it reached that conclusion in the face of abundant contrary evidence.  The CFTC's reasoning is especially troubling because it can extend to many prediction markets that are not related to elections-thus causing a major and unwarranted expansion of the CFTC's regulatory authority in a manner that would, contrary to the statute's plain text, cause multitudes of event contracts to be forbidden by the agency.

## ARGUMENT

## I. THE  CFTC'S  INTERPRETATION  OF  'GAMING'  IS  INCONSISTENT  WITH THE STATUTE.

The CFTC concluded that political event contracts 'involve gaming' within the meaning of the Commodity Exchange Act, thus authorizing the CFTC to ban them.  Indeed, the CFTC's decision to reject the proposed contract hinges critically on the determination that the proposed election contract 'involves' a 'game': if an election is not a game, or does not 'involve' a game, the CFTC has no statutory basis upon which to reject the contract.  The definition of 'gaming' and of the term 'involve' is thus outcome dispositive. But here, the CFTC's decision misreads the statute and gives the CFTC arbitrary and unrestrained authority far exceeding the Act's intended scope.

## A. The CFTC's Logic Violates the Presumption of Consistent Usage.

Under the Commodity Exchange Act, the CFTC 'may determine' that event contracts 'are contrary to the public interest' if the event contracts 'involve-(I) activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law; (II) terrorism; (III) assassination; (IV) war; (V) gaming; or (VI) other similar activity determined by the Commission, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest.'  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C).

The CFTC concluded that it had  authority to  ban  KalshiEX's  proposed  political  event contracts because they 'involve … gaming.'  As KalshiEX correctly argues, the CFTC's statutory analysis is wrong.  An event contract 'involves' an activity only if the underlying event constitutes that activity.  For example, an event contract 'involves' terrorism, assassination, or war if the event underlying the event contract is terrorism, assassination, or war.

The CFTC, however, did not assess whether the event underlying KalshiEX's contracts constituted 'gaming.'  Instead, the CFTC assessed whether the act of trading KalshiEX's contracts would be 'gaming.'  That reasoning is wrong.

As Justice Scalia explained, '[a] word or phrase is presumed to bear the same meaning throughout a text,' and this presumption 'makes sense when applied … pragmatically.' (Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law 170-71 (2012).) As the Supreme Court put it, '[T]here is a natural presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.' Atl. Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States , 286 U.S. 427, 433 (1932).

The  CFTC's  statutory  analysis,  however,  violates  this  canon.    The  CFTC's  analysis requires that the word 'involve' mean one thing with respect to 7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i)(II), (III), and (IV) (contracts that 'involve' terrorism, assassination, or war), and something  entirely  different  with  respect  to  § 7a-2(c)(5)(C)(i)(V)  (contracts  that  'involve' gaming).  In subsections (II), (II), and (IV), a contract 'involves' terrorism, assassination, or war if the underlying event is or relates to terrorism, assassination, or war.  But in subsection (V), under the CFTC's reading, a contract 'involves' gaming if the act of buying or selling the contract is itself gaming.  The CFTC's interpretation of the word 'involve' as bearing two totally different meanings within the same sentence is untenable under the presumption of consistent usage, and defies common logic.  This error is an independent and sufficient cause to grant Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.

## B. Elections Are Not 'Games,' and Trading Political Event Contracts Is Not 'Gaming.'

Even if the CFTC was correct that it has the authority to regulate 'gaming,' it would still lack authority to ban KalshiEX's prediction markets because participating in those markets is not 'gaming.'  Contrary to the CFTC's view, having a financial stake in the outcome of a future event and playing a 'game' are not the same thing. More to the point, congressional elections are not games, and contracts indexed to the outcomes of those elections are also not games and do not 'involve' games.

'Gaming' means playing a game.  It is what people do at a casino or during their weekly poker night.  When people play roulette or the slots, they are 'gaming.'  Likewise, people who bet on games-like people who go to a casino and put down money on the Super Bowl-might be said to engage in 'gaming.'

But an election is not a 'game,' and putting down money on the outcome of an election is not 'gaming.'  Of course, every person who purchases a political event contract has a financial stake in the outcome of a future event.  And often, the person does so for purposes unrelated to hedging.  But that is true for all financial markets, whether derivative or not. A retail investor who purchases Apple stock, or options on Apple stock, or an SP500 mini contract, is not hedging any risk, but that does not mean that the investor is gaming or involved in a game. If that were true, a huge swath of financial contracts that have been blessed for decades by the CFTC would have to be prohibited.  The Commission's logic on this point is dramatically overbroad and proves far, far too much. This is an additional, independent reason the Commission's interpretation must fail.

Further,  non-hedging  traders  add  exceptional  value  to  secondary  markets,  including derivative markets. It is commonly understood that '[a] financial market is a place where many speculators  with  different  pieces  of  information  meet  to  trade,  attempting  to  profit  from  their

information. Prices aggregate these diverse pieces of information and ultimately reflect an accurate assessment of firm value,' (Philip Bond, Alex Edmans &amp; Itay Goldstein, The Real Effects of Capital Markets , 4 Ann. Rev. Fin. Econ. 339, 340 (2012).) or, in this case, of the probability of an event coming to fruition. The participation of these non-hedging investors can thus improve market performance, not detract from it.

The CFTC also offered no persuasive explanation of how 'gaming' could be transmuted to 'all event contracts where the underlying event involves people contesting something.'  The CFTC's reasoning is as follows: (1) some dictionaries equate 'gaming' with 'gambling,' and (2) '[u]nder  most  state  laws,  'gambling'  involves  a  person  staking  something  of  value  upon  the outcome of a game, contest, or contingent event.'  Order at 8 &amp; n.22 (CFTC Sept. 22, 2023) ('Order').  The CFTC also pointed to a federal statute defining 'bet or wager' as 'the staking or risking by any person of something of value upon the outcome of a contest of others, a sporting event, or a game subject to chance.'  Order at 9.

This reasoning fails at multiple levels.  The fact that some dictionaries use 'gambling' and 'gaming' in the same breath does not imply that broad statutory definitions of 'gambling' always mean the same thing as 'gaming.'  Dictionaries commonly include multiple definitions of each term, an observation sufficient to prove that the terms are not synonymous. (E.g. , American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 721-22 (4th ed. 2000) (providing eight  definitions  for  'gambl[ing]'  and  two  for  'gaming'); Webster's Third New International Dictionary 932-33  (1993)  (providing  four  definitions  for  'gambling'  and  two  for  'gaming'); Oxford English Dictionary , www.oed.com (last accessed Jan. 30, 2024) (providing nine definitions for 'gambling' and fourteen definitions for 'gaming').)

Likewise,  a  federal  statute  defining  'bet  or  wager'  sheds  little  light  on  what  the  word 'gaming' means.  Indeed, it would be absurd if 'gaming' stretched as broadly as the statutes cited by the CFTC.  To the extent the CFTC believes that 'staking something of value upon the … contingent event' (Order at 8) is enough to make an activity 'gaming,' all derivatives markets would constitute gaming and therefore be illegal and the CFTC would put itself out of business. Anyone who buys wheat futures is 'staking something of value'-their money-on a 'contingent event'-an increase or decrease in the cost of wheat in the future. By the CFTC's logic, they are involved  in  a  'corn  game'  that  cannot  be  permitted  on  an  approved  contract  market.  The contradiction is obvious.

Recognizing the absurdity of this position, the CFTC suggested that its decision might be limited to prediction markets for elections because an election is a type of 'contest.' See Order at 9 ('To bet or wager on elections is to stake something of value upon the outcome of contests or others, namely, contests between electoral candidates.'); id. at 10 n.25 ('To take a position in the Congressional Control Contracts would be to stake something of value upon the outcome of a contest  of  others,  since  the  Congressional  Control  Contracts  are  premised  on  the  outcome  of contests  between  electoral  candidates  (which  ultimately  determine  the  party  affiliation  of  the Speaker and the Pres Pro Temp).').  According to the CFTC, limiting 'gaming' to 'contests' would draw the appropriate line because 'futures contracts traditionally have not been premised on the outcome of a contest of others.' Id. at 10 n.25.

This reasoning again fails and is also dramatically overbroad.  Even if an election campaign might in some sense be said to be a 'contest,' that does not mean that purchasing political event contracts is 'gaming.'  Whether something is 'gaming' turns on whether it involves playing a game,  not  on  whether  the  event  underlying  the  event  contract  is  a  'contest.'    Moreover,  a substantial literature characterizes the outcome of market processes as equivalent to the results of elections in which market participants vote with currency on a weighted voting basis, rather than through a one-person-one-vote mechanism. Put another way, every market can be reframed as a weighted voting process, or as a contest between buyers (who want lower prices) and sellers (who want higher prices) as to where to set the equilibrium price. (James  M.  Buchanan  &amp;  Gordon  Tullock, The  Calculus  of  Consent:  Logical  Foundations  of Constitutional Democracy (1962); William J. Baumol &amp; William G. Bowen, Performing Arts: The Economic Dilemma (1966) (explaining that markets are akin to electoral processes in which firms compete for consumer 'votes' by offering better products and prices); Friedrich Hayek, The Use of Knowledge in Society ,  35 Am. Econ. Rev. 519 (1945) (analogizing prices to the outcome of voting  processes  in  which  consumers  express  preferences  for  goods  and  services  instead  of candidates).) Thus, if every market is also a game, and  the  Commission  offers  no  principled  basis  upon  which  to  conclude  otherwise,  then  no derivative  on  any  market  could  be  approved  under  the  Commission's  logic  because  every derivative  would  'involve  gaming.'  Again,  this  interpretation  of  the  statute  makes  no  sense because it would negate the very existence of the markets that the statute is designed to regulate. But the agency provides no rational basis to prevent that interpretation from being applied to every market process. The agency's interpretation of the statutory language is thus unreasonable at best, and irrational at worst.

The state statutes cited by the CFTC also fail to support its position. At most, those statutes show that the word gambling can refer to betting on the outcome of a game or a contest-which, in context, is something similar to a 'game.'  So, if one bets on the outcome of the Super Bowla 'game'-or the Olympic 100-meter dash-which might not qualify as a 'game,' but is a type of 'contest'-then one is engaging in 'gambling.'  These statutes do not show that 'gaming' encompasses  betting  on  the  outcome  of  a contest ,  and  certainly  do  not  show  that  'gaming' encompasses participating in a political prediction market.  Indeed, these statutes are irrelevant multiple  times  over-they  distinguish  between  'game'  and  'contest';  distinguish  between 'game'-the underlying event (such as a football game)-and 'gambling'-the act of betting money (which the CFTC is referring to as 'gaming'); and say nothing about whether 'contest' encompasses elections.

Under the CFTC's view, playing craps, roulette, poker, blackjack, rummy, and mah jongg and entering into positions in political event prediction markets are all 'gaming'-the first six because they involve actual gaming, and the seventh because the underlying event in the event contract involves a kind of competition.  Meanwhile, under the CFTC's view, markets that involve predicting  anything  that isn't a  'contest'-whether  Congress  will  enact  immigration  reform, whether the Supreme Court will overrule Chevron , whether there will be 1 million new COVID cases, or anything else-are not gaming because the underlying events are not competitive.  It is simply  impossible  to  wring  this  line  from  the  word  'gaming.'    An  event  contract  turning  on whether a candidate will win an election (which the CFTC thinks is 'gaming') is clearly more similar to an event contract turning on whether Congress will pass a particular statute (which is not 'gaming' under the CFTC's view) than it is to mah jongg.

Further,  the  CFTC's  interpretation  of  'gaming'  would  appear  to  encompass  any  event contract turning on the outcome of a process that involves competition-which could give that term an unexpectedly broad scope.  For example, the business world is sharply competitive.  Would prediction  markets  turning  on,  for  example,  which  company  would  be  the  market  leader  in  a particular area constitute 'gaming' because companies compete against each other?

## C. The CFTC Engaged in Policy Analysis, Not Statutory Construction.

The CFTC also took the view that 'the economic impacts of the outcome of contests for Congressional control are too diffuse and unpredictable to serve the hedging and risk management functions that futures contracts have traditionally been intended to serve.'  Order at 10 n.25.  As explained below, Professor Grundfest respectfully disagrees with the CFTC's assessment of the utility of event prediction markets.  But even setting the CFTC's policy views aside, the CFTC's analysis does not support its statutory interpretation of 'gaming.'  Whether an election is a type of 'contest'-the statutory standard invented by the CFTC-has little to do with whether a particular event contract would 'serve[] … hedging and risk management functions.' Id. The CFTC would likely deny the hedging utility of a prediction market on whether Congress would pass a statute , yet even under the CFTC's view, such a prediction market would not count as 'gaming.'  The CFTC should have interpreted 'gaming' as written rather than rewriting it to conform to its policy views on the particular prediction market proposed by KalshiEX.

The CFTC's analysis is not entitled to deference under Chevron USA, Inc. v. NRDC , 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  Under Chevron , courts defer to agency interpretations only if they are reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes-not when  agencies rewrite unambiguous  statutes. Moreover, if the Supreme Court overrules or narrows Chevron in Relentless, Inc. v. Department of Commerce , No. 22-1219, or Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo , No. 22-451, then this case is  an  even  more  straightforward  candidate  for  vacatur.    Because  this  Court  should  interpret 'gaming' without deference to the agency's obviously incorrect construction, the outcome of this case  turns  on  the  Court's  (not  the  agency's)  interpretation  of  'gaming,'  applying  traditional statutory-construction techniques, rather than the agency's policy views about prediction markets. And there is no path by which traditional statutory construction supports the outcome reached by the CFTC.

## II. THE CFTC'S PUBLIC INTEREST ANALYSIS IS ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS.

Assuming the CFTC has statutory authority to conduct a 'public interest' analysis, that analysis  must  conform  with  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act.    Here,  it  did  not.    The  CFTC committed three errors of law:

- It adopted an arbitrary and unsupported view of what 'hedging' means and, as a result, ignored the proposed contracts' legitimate hedging purposes.
- It ignored the fundamental point that the 'public interest' goes beyond hedging.
- It did not explain why it rejected the empirical evidence offered by KalshiEX and its supporters.

## A. The Proposed Contracts Serve Legitimate Hedging Purposes.

First,  the  CFTC  was  dead  wrong  on  what  qualifies  as  'hedging  utility.'    The  CFTC acknowledged that 'control of a chamber of Congress could, following a number of independent intervening events, generally affect a wide variety of personal liabilities and economic factors.' Order at 17.  But, in the CFTC's view, 'that does not establish that the Congressional Control Contracts can be used for specific, identifiable hedging purposes and thus does not establish the hedging utility of the Congressional Control Contracts.' Id. Thus, according to the CFTC, an event  contract  has  hedging  utility  only  if  it  'can  be  used  for  specific,  identifiable  hedging purposes.'

As a matter of basic economics, this reasoning is indefensible.  A political event contract plainly can be used for 'specific, identifiable hedging purposes.'  Financial market participants routinely consider the probability of a particular candidate winning an election to accurately price assets.  It is inevitable that some businesses benefit when Republicans are in charge and other businesses benefit when Democrats are in charge.  As those probabilities change, the value of the assets change.  For this reason, political event contracts have bona fide hedging utility: they reduce a  company's  exposure  to  the  risk  associated  with  a  particular  candidate  winning.    Suppose  a company knows that if one candidate wins, it will likely be able to drill for oil on a particular piece of land, and if that candidate loses, it likely will not.  The company's value may swing dramatically depending on the outcome of the election-making it prudent to purchase a political event contract as a hedge.  That hedging purpose is both 'specific' and 'identifiable.'

Indeed, significant economic research confirms that 'outcomes of elections or referendums have an impact on financial markets.' (Michael  Hanke,  Sebastian  Stöckl  &amp;  Alex  Weissensteiner, Recovering  Election  Winner Probabilities from Stock Prices , 45 Fin. Rsch. Letters 102 (2022).) A 2022 article by Michael Hanke, Sebastian Stöckl, and Alex  Weissensteiner  documents  that  the  probability  of  the  outcome  of  the  2020  presidential election could be derived from observed stock market prices, meaning that election expectations cause stock price changes.

Econ. 428 (2018); Tomasz Piotr Wisniewski, Is There a Link Between Politics and Stock Returns? A Literature Survey , 47 Int'l Rev. Fin. Analysis 15 (2016).) The same line of research establishes the existence of 'Democratic stocks' and 'Republican stocks'-stocks that outperform when Democrats control and stocks that outperform when Republicans control-and that it is possible to construct 'long-short portfolios that show a positive return conditional on correctly forecasting the election outcome.' (Hanke et al., supra note 12, at 103.) Prediction markets are thus 'useful both for investors who want to speculate on the election outcome and for those who want to reduce the exposure of their portfolio (or hedge against) the election outcome.' (Id.)

Similar research was presented to the CFTC by multiple commenters. (E.g. , KalshiEx,  LLC,  Comment  Letter  on  Commission's  Specific  Questions  Related  to KalshiEx,  LLC's Proposed Congressional Control Contracts at App. C at 4-6 (July 23, 2023) (CFTC  Comment  No.  72716)  (discussing  evidence  of  election  risk  and  hedging  need  and reviewing literature finding that 'changes in political control result in changes to the prices of traded  assets'),  AR2728-30;  Eric  Zitzewitz,  Comment  Letter  on  Review  of  KalshiEx  LLC's Proposed Congressional Control Contracts Pursuant to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation  40.11(c)  at  1  (Sept.  24,  2022)  (CFTC  Comment  No.  72449),  AR1404-05;  Adam Ozimek, Comment Letter and Attachments (Sept. 22, 2022) (CFTC Comment No. 72467), AR 1484-1523 (discussing benefits and accuracy of prediction markets and citing literature discussing elections).) An organized, regulated election prediction market would therefore better allow investors to hedge against the electoral risk that is evidently embedded in stock market prices.

Kalshi's large position limits and order sizes also reinforce the proposed contracts' value for hedging purposes. These regulatory safeguards reduce the number of casual speculators and increase the number of participants who purchase the contracts for risk-mitigation purposes.

Indeed,  today,  investors do hedge  against  adverse  elections  outcomes,  but  they  do  so through indirect and inefficient hedging strategies. It would be more efficient and transparent if businesses and investors could simply enter into such hedging arrangements directly.

## B. The Proposed Contracts Generate Legitimate Non-Hedging Public Benefits.

Even assuming that political event contracts lack hedging value, an assumption contrary to evidence, the CFTC failed to consider a basic point: there is more to life than hedging.

The CFTC stated:

[I]n  evaluating whether the Congressional Control Contracts are contrary to the public interest, the Commission has considered the contracts' hedging utility and price-basing utility.    Additionally,  the  Commission  has  considered  the  potential impact that trading in the Congressional Control Contracts may have on election integrity,  or  the  perception  of  election  integrity-as  well  as  the  extent  to  which permitting  trading  in  the  Congressional  Control  Contracts  could  require  the Commission to assume a role in overseeing the electoral process.

Order  at  15  (footnotes  omitted).    In  other  words,  in  assessing  the  public  interest,  the  CFTC considered:  (1)  'hedging  utility  and  price-basing  utility,'  and  (2)  potential  harmful  outcomes related to election integrity.

This analysis presents a paradigmatic case of an agency 'entirely fail[ing] to consider an important aspect of the problem.' Auto. Ins. Co. Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n, of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut.,  463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  There is a crucial aspect of the public interest that the CFTC failed to consider: the non-economic value of prediction markets in predicting the future. Prediction markets assemble the wisdom of crowds to achieve estimates of election outcomes that are superior to predictions by any one pundit alone. (See Bond et al, supra note 9.) In  a  world with miniscule poll response rates, sky-high polarization, and rampant fake news, prediction markets offer an objective indicator of the probability of particular election outcomes.  The public interest supports combatting fake news and providing a better mechanism for the revelation of truth.

Prediction  market  probabilities  also  benefit  academic  research.    Some  researchers  use prediction  market  probabilities  to  assess  how  elections  influence  economic  variables. (See, e.g. , Hanke et al., supra note 12 and citations therein.) For instance, they may analyze whether an increase in the market's assessment of the probability of a particular  candidate  prevailing  is  correlated  with  an  increase  or  decrease  in  other  economic variables.  Alternatively, they may use prediction markets to learn which events actually influence campaigns.  If a particular news story  causes a  candidate's probability of victory to spike (as measured through prices of political event contracts), researchers can predict that the news story impacted  the  election  rather  than  attempting  to  reconstruct  the  reasons  a  particular  candidate prevailed after the fact.  Legalizing prediction markets will increase participation and make them more liquid and more useful for academic purposes.  The CFTC ignored all of this; it concluded that because prediction markets cannot be used for hedging (a conclusion that was itself wrong), prediction markets must be bad.

True, the CFTC stated in passing that it had 'considered assertions by Kalshi and other commenters that the Congressional Control Contracts would serve as a check on misinformation and inaccurate polling, stating that market-based alternatives tend to be more accurate than polling or  other  methods  of  predicting  election  outcomes.'    Order  at  21.    'Stating  that  a  factor  was considered, however, is not a substitute for considering it.' Getty v. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. , 805 F.2d 1050, 1055 (D.C. Cir. 1986).

The CFTC also seems to have ignored the observation that if a person seeks to manipulate election outcomes, manipulating the event market would be a foolish mechanism by which to achieve that result. First off, traders in this market must identify themselves to intermediaries and therefore cannot remain hidden. Manipulators do not rationally gravitate to markets that mandate this level of transparency. Second, contributing to dark-money pools that can purchase advertising and engage in other forms of influence would likely be far more efficient in influencing outcomes than  attempting  to  influence  event  contract  prices.  Third,  markets  can  be  self-correcting.  If  a manipulator tries to inflate the prices of a Democratic or Republican victory, the manipulator will only attract traders on the other side of the market. Dark-money contributions have no equivalent offsetting mechanisms because, they are, by definition, hidden and dark, and do not operate in markets that allow for the formation of offsetting positions.

The risk of manipulation is thus rationally analyzed as a comparative phenomenon. From that perspective, the proposed contract is highly unlikely to contribute to electoral manipulation precisely  because  of  the  existence  of  alternative,  superior  methods  of  manipulation.  Indeed,  if anything, the self-correcting nature of the contract suggests that it is more likely to have an antimanipulative effect.

The  CFTC  showed  no  signs  of  giving  meaningful  consideration  to  any  of  these  noneconomic benefits.  Affirming that reasoning is particularly troubling because it would allow the agency to apply that approach to any prediction market, not just congressional control contracts. The  Court  should  not  allow  the  CFTC  to  extinguish,  based  on  incomplete  and  unexplained reasoning, a tool of great potential social and academic value.

## C. The Order Fails to Adequately Explain Its Concerns Regarding Manipulation.

Third, the  CFTC  did  not  adequately  explain  its  conclusions  regarding  the  risk  of manipulation.    As  Professor  Grundfest  and  other  commenters  explained  to  the  CFTC,  several studies of existing prediction markets have shown that price 'pump' attempts are short-lived and, as  explained  above,  disciplined  by  the  market's  self-correcting  mechanisms.    Moreover,  the relatively low position limit means any one participant is unlikely to be able to move the market in a meaningful way as traders enter on the other side of the market to profit from the mispricing. As  for  concerns  about  manipulation  of  elections,  commenters  offered  abundant  empirical  and theoretical evidence suggesting it would not occur.

Of course, the CFTC, as an expert administrative agency, was free to review the evidence and make a predictive judgment as to the risk of manipulation.  But it gave no sign of having actually made such a predictive judgment.

The  CFTC  observed:  '[T]here  is  also  research  suggesting  that  election  markets  may incentivize the creation of 'fake' or unreliable information in the interest of moving the market, and a number of commenters also raised this concern.'  Order at 22.  But there also is research showing that election markets would decrease misinformation-as the CFTC acknowledged. Id. at 21.  With conflicting evidence in the record, the CFTC must show its work.  It did not.  Instead, it merely noted the existence of 'research' suggesting that election prediction markets might be harmful, and then leapt to the conclusion that they must be contrary to the public interest.  It was incumbent on the CFTC to grapple with the conflicting evidence in the record and give a reasoned explanation of why it reached its conclusion.

CONCLUSION
KalshiEx's motion for summary judgment should be granted.
