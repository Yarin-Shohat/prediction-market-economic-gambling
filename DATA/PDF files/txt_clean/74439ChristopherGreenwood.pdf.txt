## INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE

Aristotle International, Inc. ('Aristotle'), through its PredictIt, Inc. subsidiary, acts as a clearing house and service provider to Victoria University of Wellington's PredictIt market, which has offered contracts comparable to those at issue in this matter.

PredictIt began operating pursuant to a No Action Letter issued to Victoria University by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC' or 'Commission') Division of Market Oversight  in  2014. (CFTC Letter No. 14-130.) Within  the  bounds  of  the  2014  No  Action  Letter,  PredictIt  has  offered Congressional Control Contracts for the 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2022 election cycles.  In servicing these  markets,  Aristotle  has  generated  valuable  experience  and  data  relevant  to  issues  in  this matter.

Aristotle is a plaintiff in a challenge to the CFTC's arbitrary and capricious decision to withdraw the 2014 No Action Letter. (Clarke v. CFTC , 74 F.4th 627 (5th Cir. 2023).)

Aristotle also has applied to operate a Designated Contract Market ('DCM'), which would allow  it  to  operate  similarly  to  Kalshi,  the  Plaintiff  in  this  matter.    Aristotle's  application  is currently pending before the CFTC.  If Aristotle's application is approved, Aristotle intends to offer contracts similar to those offered by Kalshi on a DCM.

## INTRODUCTION

KalshiEX LLC ('Kalshi') is a Designated Contract Market ('DCM') regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ('CFTC' or 'Commission').  On June 6, 2023, Kalshi notified the CFTC that it intended to list two contracts for trading ('Proposed Contracts'). ('Re: KalshiEX LLC - Commission Regulation 40.2(a) Notification Regarding the Initial Listing of the 'Will &lt;chamber of Congress&gt;  Be Controlled by &lt;party&gt; for &lt;term&gt; ?'Contract,' KalshiEx LLC, June 12, 2013, www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/ptc/23/06/ptc0612232834. pdf.) While the Proposed Contracts are described as 'Congressional Control' contracts, they ultimately resolve based upon the political party affiliation of either the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United States or the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate. (Id. at 7.)

Pursuant to the relevant regulation, (17 CFR § 40.11(c).) the CFTC subjected the Proposed Contracts to a 90day  review  period,  which  ended  with  the  rejection  of  the  relevant  contracts  in  a  Final  Order ('Order' or 'the Order'). ('In  the  Matter  of  the  Certification  by  KalshiEX  LLC  of  Derivatives  Contracts  with Respect to Political Control of the United States Senate and United States  House  of Representatives,' Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Sept. 22, 2023, www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/documents/2023/orgkexkalshiordersig230922.pdf.)

The  Administrative  Procedure  Act  requires  courts  to  set  aside  agency  action  that  is 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.' 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  In making a decision, the  agency must 'address important aspect[s] of the problem.' Gresham v.  Azar , 950 F.3d 93, 102 (D.C. Cir. 2020) ( internal citation omitted ).  The agency also must demonstrate that it considered arguments and evidence to the contrary; it may not merely state that it has considered the concern. Id. at 103.  The agency may not 'offe[r] an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.' Am. Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue , 873 F.3d 914, 923 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  It also must not 'brush[] aside critical facts.' Id. at 932.  When departing from past practices, the agency must 'acknowledge the change and offer a reasoned explanation for it.' Id. at 923.

Before it prohibits a DCM from listing a contract, the CFTC is required to adhere to a twostep  process.    7  U.S.C.  §  7a-2(c)(5)(C).    First,  it  must  determine  that  the  contracts  involve: (1) activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law; (2) terrorism; (3) assassination; (4) war; (5) gaming; or (6) other similar activity determined by the Commission, by rule or regulation, to be contrary to the public interest.  Second, it must determine that the contracts are contrary to the public interest.  Importantly, the statute requires the CFTC to find that a contract meets both prongs of the test before the CFTC may prohibit its listing.

The CFTC found that the Proposed Contracts relate to both gaming and activity that is unlawful under State law and that the Proposed Contracts are contrary to the public interest.  The Commission's Order, however, deviates from the legal requirements found in the statute, fails to consider arguments and evidence presented to the Commission during the notice and comment period, and fails to demonstrate that it seriously considered arguments and evidence that disagree with the Commission's final conclusions.  The Order is also inconsistent with the Commission's previous treatment of contracts offered by DCMs, (The  Order  is  consistent  with  the  logic  of  the  Commission's  2012  NADEX  order prohibiting similar contracts.  As discussed below, both the NADEX Order and the Kalshi Order are inconsistent with the current regulatory environment. See In the Matter of the Self-Certification by  North  American  Derivatives  Exchange,  Inc.,  of  Political  Event  Derivatives  Contracts  and Related Rule Amendments under Part 40 of the Regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,  Order  Prohibiting  the  Listing  or  Trading  of  Political  Event  Contracts ,  at  4, https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/6224-12.) including those offered by Plaintiff Kalshi, and risks creating chaos in regulated markets.  For these reasons, the Order should be found to be arbitrary and capricious.

## ARGUMENT

## I. ELECTION CONTRACTS ARE NOT GAMING

According to the CFTC, Kalshi's Proposed Contracts are akin to a spin of a roulette wheel: a game of chance with no economic utility.  This characterization of the Proposed Contracts is both unsupported within the Order and is out of sync with market realities.

The CFTC's Order found that the Proposed Contracts constitute gaming, which the CFTC defines as being synonymous with gambling, betting, or wagering.  The CFTC broadly defines these terms to mean that the relevant statute prohibits risking something of value based upon the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a future event, or a contest of others.  Order at 8-10.  Noting that many regulated futures contracts would potentially fit this definition, the CFTC adds that gaming, by definition, does not correlate to the price of commodities and other financial instruments. Order at 10 n.25.  The CFTC then claims that 'the economic impacts of the outcome of contests for Congressional control are too diffuse and unpredictable to serve the hedging and risk management functions that futures contracts have traditionally been intended to serve.' Id.

## The proposed contracts serve an economic purpose

Several  of  the  comments  submitted  during  the  CFTC's  Notice  and  Comment  Period disputed the CFTC's premise regarding the hedging function of these products.  The CFTC is required to provide its rationale for disregarding significant objections and evidence to its decision making. Stewart v. Azar , 313 F. Supp. 3d 237, 264 (D.D.C. 2018) (citing Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System , 419 U.S.  281, 296, 95 S.Ct. 438, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974)).

The CFTC fails to grapple with the clear flow of economic effects from elections.  It notes the reasoning of the many commentors who describe a clear link between election results and economic outcomes, and merely characterizes this link as 'diffuse and unpredictable.'  Order at 16.  It states, ignoring comments to the contrary, that Kalshi and the commentors have failed to identify specific links between elections and economic consequences.  Order at 17.  The CFTC had an obligation to do more than '[n]od[] to concerns raised by commenters only to dismiss them in a conclusory manner.' Gresham , 950 F.3d at 103.  The CFTC's conclusion is divorced from reality, and ignores clear evidence that traders already consider election results in their investing strategies.

PredictIt Data, for example, already appears on the Bloomberg Terminal, where investors can see current probabilities of election winners.  BlackRock offers a Geopolitical Risk Indicator, which highlights several potential risks, including those of US-China strategic competition and technology decoupling, and climate policy gridlock, which are directly impacted by American congressional elections. ('BlackRock Geopolitical Risk Indicator,' BLACKROCK, www.blackrock.com/corporate/ insights/blackrock-investment-institute/interactive-charts/geopolitical-risk-dashboard.) Political  risk  insurance is already widespread, (Political Risk Insurance, NAIC, https://content.naic.org/cipr-topics/political-riskinsurance. See also, e.g. , https://starrcompanies.com/Insurance/Casualty/Political-Risk; https://www.allianz-trade.com/en_global/news-insights/business-tips-and-trade-advice/what-ispolitical-risk-and-how-to-protect-against-it.html; https://www.aig.com/business/insurance/ political-risk; https://www.lloyds.com/conducting-business/risk-locator/business-guidance/ political-risk; https://www.marsh.com/us/services/politicalrisk/insights/political-risk-map2021.html; https://www.aon.com/risk-services/crisis-management/political-risks.jsp.) and political risk is a staple topic at leading business schools including Wharton, (See How  Companies  Can  Navigate  Political  Risks  Successfully ,  KNOWLEDGE  AT WHARTON, https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/companies-can-successfully-navigatepolitical-risks/.) Stanford, (See Political Risk: How Businesses and Organizations Can Anticipate Global Insecurity , STANFORD UNIVERSITY, https://fsi.stanford.edu/publication/political-risk-how-businesses-andorganizations-can-anticipate-global-insecurity.) and Harvard. (See Managing 21st-Century Political Risk , HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW, https://hbr.org/2018/05/managing-21st-century-political-risk.) While political risk insurance has traditionally been offered to American or European-based companies doing business in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia, coverage for U.S.-based risks is now under discussion. (See Political risk coverage for US may be live issue after riots shake country ,  S&amp;P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE, https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/newsinsights/latest-news-headlines/political-risk-coverage-for-us-may-be-live-issue-after-riots-shakecountry-62627872; Insuring Political Risk in the United States , PILLSBURY, https://www.policyholderpulse.com/insuring-political-risk-united-states/.)

American elections have clear and predictable economic consequences.  One paper found that a full 4.35 percent of U.S. companies could be labeled as 'blue,' meaning their stocks perform better  under a Democratic President. (Yan, Yuxing, Red vs. blue stocks: politics and profitability of firms , PROCEEDINGS OF 27TH INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS RESEARCH CONFERENCE, June 12, 2014.) The  same  study  found that 'red' firms constitute 5.11 percent of stocks.  Red and blue stocks are subject to 48 percent higher volatility than colorless ones in election years.  An investment strategy of longing and shorting opposite-colored stocks at the beginning of a new administration was projected to generate an abnormal return of 9.3 percent per year. (Id. at 190.)

Many  of  the  economic  effects  of  elections  are  both  direct  and  entirely  predictable. Candidate Biden, for example, repeatedly campaigned on his plan to revoke the permit for the Keystone  XL  Pipeline. (Oliphant, James, Democrat Biden Says He Would Kill Keystone XL Pipeline , REUTERS, May 19, 2020, available at www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22V0RF/.) He  followed  through  with  this  promise  on  his  first  day  in  office. (E.O.  13990, Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis (Jan. 20, 2021).) Investors in Keystone's operator and related companies clearly could have hedged their positions based  on  projected  outcomes  in  the  Presidential  race.  As  discussed  below,  partisan  control  of Congress  has  similarly  predictable  consequences  for  red  and  blue  stocks,  leading  to  obvious hedging opportunities.

The CFTC attempts to undermine this predictability of these economic consequences by pointing out that there are several steps between an election and the enactment of a law, such as approval by both Chambers of Congress and a presidential signature.  Order at 16 n.16.  While it is  certainly  true  that  there  are  steps  between  elections  and  the  enactment  of  legislation,  both lawmakers and market participants are already fully capable of tempering their expectations as to whether certain types of legislation will be enacted based on the partisan control and makeup of both Chambers, and on the occupant of the White House.

Consider, for example, the reaction to the news that Democrats had won control of the Senate, clinching a legislative trifecta (meaning that Democrats held majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the President was a Democrat), after the Georgia runoffs in the 2020 elections.  Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the results 'change the dynamic in the Senate, but also in the country.' (Ferris,  Sarah et  al ., Jubilant  Democratic  Leaders  Look  to  Move  Fast  after  Georgia Surprise ,  POLITICO,  Jan.  6,  2021, available  at www.politico.com/news/2021/01/06/congressdemocratic-takeover-georgia-senate-455333.)

Senator Wyden (D-OR), the contemporaneous incoming Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said that the change in Senate control 'gives us the opportunity to have a very different set of choices.' (Emma,  Caitlin, Georgia  Just  Delivered  Democrats  Their  Most  Powerful  Weapon , POLITICO,  Jan.  8,  2021, available at www.politico.com/news/2021/01/08/georgia-senatedemocrats-powerful-weapon-budget-456116.)

Both of these lawmakers were referring to the possibility of passing legislation through the Budget Reconciliation process, which they immediately understood would allow them to pass partisan legislation on a limited set of topics.  The subsequent reconciliation bills, known as the American  Rescue  Plan  and  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act,  included  $1.843  trillion (Congressional  Budget  Office, Estimated  Budgetary  Effects  of  HR  1319,  American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 as Passed by the Senate on March 6, 2021 ,  Mar.  2021, available at www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-03/Estimated_Budgetary_Effects_of_HR_1319_as_passed_0.pdf.),(Congressional Budget Office, Estimated Budgetary Effects of H.R. 5376, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, as Amended in the Nature of a Substitute (ERN22335) and Posted on the Website  of  the  Senate  Majority  Leader  on  July  27,  2022 ,  Aug.  5,  2022, available at www.cbo.gov/system/files/2022-08/hr5376_IR_Act_8-3-22.pdf.) in  new spending through 2031 along with reductions in spending on prescription drugs and new tax credits for renewable energy and electric vehicle investment.  This spending was well within investor expectations of what a Democratic Congressional majority could focus its lawmaking power on.

As they demonstrated in early 2021, market participants can understand the legislative process.  The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF ($ICLN), an index of equities in the clean energy sector  (which  was  substantially  affected  by  the  Budget  Reconciliation  process),  rallied  after Democrats won control of the Senate, increasing by a full 17 percent between December 31, 2020, and January 8, 2021, far outpacing the Dow Jones Industrial Average which rose by 1.6 percent during  the  same  period.    The  Global  X  Lithium  &amp;  Battery  Tech  ETF  ($LIT),  which  tracks companies involved in the production and processing of Lithium, a key element of electric vehicle and other battery production, rose by 14.5% during this same period.  Investors did not consider it likely (A PredictIt market asking if the Democratic trifecta would raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour peaked at an average daily trade price of $0.17, implying that traders thought that such an increase was always below a 20% probability. See https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7075/Will-Biden-policy-to-raise-minimum-wage-to$15-per-hour-in-2021-succeed.) that Congress would pass other Democratic campaign priorities, such as a minimum wage increase, that could not easily be included in the Budget Reconciliation process. (Sozzi, Brian, Don't Expect a $15 Federal Minimum Wage: Goldman Sachs ,  YAHOO! FINANCE, Feb. 8, 2021, finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-expect-a-15-federal-minimum-wagegoldman-sachs-130431033.html.) 

The  CFTC  further  attempts  to  undermine  the  economic  purpose  of  these  contracts  by referring to their binary nature.  Order at 18.  According to the CFTC, the binary payout of these contracts limits their utility as a hedging vehicle, and makes them akin to sports betting.  While the contracts do payout in a binary fashion, this conclusion ignores the real-world utilization of prediction market contracts.

Prediction market positions are tradeable until the date of settlement.  On both PredictIt and Kalshi, traders who purchase shares at one price are free to sell shares prior to the resolution of the market.  In PredictIt's market asking about partisan control over Congress following the 2022 midterm elections, for example, 68 percent of shares purchased over the life of the market were sold at least once prior to the settlement of the market.  In the equivalent 2020 market, 80 percent of shares were sold at least once prior to settlement.  Contrast this with the typical all-ornothing structure of a gambling bet.  Once a gambling bet is made there is no secondary market where a participant can exit the bet.

While the final payout structures in gaming and prediction markets are similar-all to the correct side, and nothing to the incorrect side-the free tradability of prediction market positions prior to settlement makes the uses and behavior of prediction market positions quite different from gaming.  On PredictIt, typical traders do not buy and hold shares to the payout date for an all or nothing result, but instead make an investment, observe a profit or loss, and exit the market via a trade with a payout of some amount other than the binary $0 or $1.  Similar behavior is evident in non-binary futures  markets  where many traders  take  and  then  exit  positions  before  settlement dates.

Kalshi's Proposed Contracts, thus, are not equivalent to a spin of the roulette wheel or a bet on a football game.  There is clear evidence, which the CFTC failed to substantively address as required by the APA, that the Proposed Contracts have serious economic value.  Yes, there are steps between elections and the enactment of legislation.  No, these steps do not eliminate the hedging  value  of  Kalshi's  Proposed  Contracts.    The  CFTC's  conclusion  is  in  error,  and  its mishandling of record evidence is arbitrary and capricious, all in violation of the APA.

## II. THE CFTC IS IMPROPERLY SUBSTITUTING AN ECONOMIC PURPOSE TEST FOR THE STATUTORILY MANDATED PUBLIC INTEREST TEST

After finding that the Proposed Contracts constituted both gaming and activity that is unlawful under state law, the Commission was required by the statute to proceed to an analysis of whether the Proposed Contracts were within the public interest.  7 U.S.C. § 7a-2(c)(5)(C).  The CFTCciting to a single exchange between two Senators-proceeded to describe the mandated test as a 'form of the 'economic purpose test'' that was in a previous version of the statute.  Order at 13. The economic purpose test, however, was repealed in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA).  If Congress had intended only ten years later to re-enact that test, it would have used  the  same  phrase.    Instead,  Congress  deliberately  chose  to  use  a  facially  broader  phrase, 'public  interest.'    Indeed,  in  the  colloquy  cited  by  the  CFTC,  a  question  is  posed  regarding 'economic use' but answered using the statutory phrase 'public interest.' (56 Cong. Rec. S5906-07 (July 15, 2010) (statements of Sen. Diane Feinstein and Sen. Blanche  Lincoln), available  at https://www.congress.gov/111/crec/2010/07/15/CREC-2010-0715-senate.pdf.)

The CFTC cannot act in a way that 'is manifestly contrary to the statute,' as it did when it swapped in a repealed Economic Purpose test where the statute uses a Public Interest test. See, e.g ., Good Fortune Shipping SA v. Comm'r , 897 F.3d 256, 261 (D.C. Cir. 2018). (See also Dorszynski v. United States , 418 U.S. 424, 449 (1974); Escondido Mutual Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772 (1984) ('congressional intent finds clear expression in the words of the statute') (Marshall, J.,  concurring); North Dakota v. United States , 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983) ('[I]t should be generally assumed that Congress expresses its purposes through the ordinary meaning of the words it uses, we have often stated that '[a]bsent a clearly  expressed  legislative  intention  to  the  contrary,  [statutory]  language  must  ordinarily  be regarded as conclusive.'' (quoting Consumer Product Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc. , 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980)).) Indeed, the CFTC itself  has  proclaimed  that  it  has  'discretion  to  consider  other  factors  in  addition  to  the economic  purpose  test  in  determining  whether  an  event  contract  is  contrary  to  the  public interest.' (See In the Matter of the Self-Certification by North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc., of Political Event Derivatives Contracts and Related Rule Amendments under Part 40 of the Regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Order Prohibiting the Listing or Trading of Political Event Contracts , at 4, available at https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/6224-12.)

The  CFTC  then  erroneously  concluded  that  'it  has  not  been  demonstrated  that  the Congressional Control Contracts could reasonably be expected to be used for hedging and/or price basing  on  more  than  an  occasional  basis  or  that  the  Congressional  Control  Contracts  could reasonably be expected to be used predominantly by market participants having a commercial or hedging interest.'  Order at 19.  As discussed above, this conclusion is in error, and this Court should reject it.

## III. THE PROPOSED CONTRACTS ARE WITHIN THE PUBLIC INTEREST

As described above, the economic purpose of the Proposed Contracts has already been extensively demonstrated to the Commission, which has not seriously grappled with the evidence put before it.  The Proposed Contracts also pass the Public Interest test that the Statute requires the CFTC to follow.

In particular, the Proposed Contracts would serve the public interest through their ability to generate probabilities of the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.  In the context of elections, the general public has already demonstrated a significant interest in these probabilities.

When event contract markets, such as PredictIt and Kalshi, offer contracts for sale, they are initially offered without any sale price attached.  The contracts generate prices when traders one buying the 'Yes' side of the contract option and the other buying the 'No' side-agree on a price.  This price then repeatedly changes over the course of the life of the contract as traders digest new information.  These prices continuously reflect the probability of the specified event outcome occurring, and they reflect the consensus of the wide diversity of opinions and worldviews of a diverse pool of traders.

This is the essential public service that prediction markets offer.  They serve an information aggregation function for individual members of the public, as well as academics, companies, and governments who use them to further their research, manage their business operations, and set policy. (Hong, L., &amp; Page, S. (2012). Some Microfoundations of Collective Wisdom , a chapter in H.  Landemore &amp; J.  Elster (Eds.), Collective Wisdom: Principles and Mechanisms at  56-71, Cambridge University Press, doi: 10.1017/CBO9780511846427.004) Since its launch in 2014, PredictIt prices have generated significant public interest.  These prices have been widely cited in media (What to Expect in 2021 According to Prediction Markets , THE ECONOMIST, Jan. 2, 2021, https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2021/01/02/what-to-expect-in-2021-according-toprediction-markets) and among investment analysts, often as an alternative to polling or election models.  PredictIt data has been used by students and academics at over 130 universities  across  a  wide  range  of  subjects  including  microeconomics,  political  behavior, computer science, and game theory.

Well more than a million unique individuals visited the PredictIt website during the week of the 2020 election, far in excess of the number of individuals buying and selling contracts during this time period.  This activity indicates that members of the public were visiting PredictIt not only to make trades, but also to see how the market was reacting to information as it came in.  It also shows that the public sees prediction market data as an important tool in understanding election results,  which are often unclear and even misleading as individual counties across the country report partial results.  PredictIt traders, for example, had priced in that candidate Biden was likely to win the State of Michigan in 2020, well before ballot returns from Detroit gave him the lead in the official count.  In a recent example, PredictIt traders digested early returns and concluded that former President Trump was almost guaranteed to win the 2024 Republican Presidential Primary election in New Hampshire, even as these returns showed a close race. (Who will win the 2024 New Hampshire Republican primary? , PREDICTIT, available at https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/8071/Who-will-win-the-2024-New-HampshireRepublican-primary (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).)

PredictIt market prices receive significant attention from the news media, political actors, and  investors.    This  is  precisely  because,  over  time,  political  prediction  markets  have  built  a reputation for accurately reflecting the probability that a candidate or party will win an election.

The diversity of available viewpoints is essential to the accuracy of these price movements, and it distinguishes prediction markets from other tools such as expert forecasts. (Miller,  Thomas  W., Predicting  the  2020  Presidential  Election ,  DATA  SCIENCE QUARTERLY 1.1 (2021).) In a political prediction market, individuals make trades based on a significant number of data sources.  These include  objective  measures  like  polling  results,  fundraising,  and  endorsements,  but  they  also include subjective measures like debate performance, the perceived impact of press reports, local yard sign or bumper sticker sightings, and perceived crowd sizes.  One pool of traders, for example, may see a candidate's debate performance as likely to help earn votes, while others may see such a performance as likely to do more harm than good.  Substitutes like polling aggregates or expert forecasts cannot serve as substitutes for the public service that prediction markets provide.

The case for prediction markets relies on the same insight that supports democracy (This is not a new observation.  Two millennia ago, Aristotle, in his seminal work Politics , made a compelling case that collective judgment is as good or better than that of experts.) and the efficiency of a market economy. (Hayek, Friedrich A., The Use of Knowledge in Society , AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW 4 at 519-530 (1945).) The  aggregate of the decisions of millions of voters or consumers will produce better outcomes than decisions made by even the best qualified experts. Some modern research  suggests  that  both  diversity  of  viewpoint  and  individual  expertise  are important to the accuracy of prediction markets.

The Commission  is further concerned that unscrupulous individuals will spread misinformation  in  order  to  both  manipulate  Kalshi's  Proposed  Contracts  and  to  'influence elections or electoral perceptions' by causing price movement on the contracts.  Order at 20.  This concern  ignores  the  role  that  prediction  markets  already  serve  as  a  counterweight  to  the unscrupulous use of polling, which is already a widespread practice.

In  contrast  to  the  barriers  to  manipulation  in  well-functioning,  liquid  markets,  public opinion  polls  are  routinely  used  with  the  express  intent  of  manipulating  perceptions  of  likely success, fundraising, and voting.  Pollsters can publish the results of Push Polls, which measure voter attitudes about candidates, but only after the voters have heard targeted negative or positive messages about said candidates. (See Jonathan S. Fox, Push Polling: The Art of Political Persuasion , 49 FLA. L. REV. 563 (1997).) Partisan and in-house campaign pollsters routinely manipulate sampling methodologies, question design, and even polling times and methods to generate positive indicators for their clients, and release the most favorable results to the public.  Other pollsters may manipulate their data, using the same tactics discussed above, in order to prevent the release of outlier polls in a practice known as 'herding.' (Silver,  Nate, Here's  Proof  Some  Pollsters  Are  Putting  a  Thumb  on  the  Scale , FIVETHIRTYEIGHT,  Nov.  14,  2014, available  at fivethirtyeight.com/features/heres-proof-somepollsters-are-putting-a-thumb-on-the-scale/.) In the 2022 midterm elections, Democratic strategists  raised  credible  concerns  that  partisan  Republican  pollsters  were  'flooding'  polling averages in order to manipulate public perceptions. (Shepard, Stevan, The Biden Gap and the Partisan Poll Flood: Breaking Down the Latest Senate Surveys , POLITICO, Nov. 1, 2022, available at www.politico.com/news/2022/11/01/ biden-gap-senate-surveys-00064362.)

Efforts  to  manipulate  well-functioning  markets  in  similar  ways  are  simply  profit opportunities for informed traders, who are financially incentivized to discern fact from fiction. The approval of the Proposed Contracts would not lead to the sort of manipulation about which the  Commission  is  concerned.    Rather,  it  would  be  a  significant  tool  in  combating  election misinformation.

## IV. THE  CFTC  IS  ARBITRARILY  INTERPRETING  THE  COMMODITY EXCHANGE ACT IN A WAY THAT IMPERMISSIBLY DEVIATES FROM PAST PRACTICES WITHOUT OFFERING EXPLANATION

The CFTC's conclusion that Kalshi's Proposed Contracts constitute impermissible gaming, or are contrary to state law, is inconsistent with its treatment of other contracts.

The CFTC's Order claims that the use of the word 'involve' in the statute means that the CFTC can prohibit both 'contracts whose underlying [purpose] is one of the enumerated activities, and contracts with a different connection to one of the enumerated activities because, for example, they  'relate  closely'  to,  'entail,'  or  'have  as  an  essential  feature  or  consequence'  one  of  the enumerated activities.'      Order  at  6-7.    The  CFTC  then  cites  several  state  statutes  that  define gaming as akin to taking a stake on the outcome of a contest of others or on a future contingent event that is not influenced by one of the parties taking a stake. Id. at 8-9.  The CFTC also notes that some states explicitly prohibit gaming on elections. Id. at 9.  For the CFTC, the fact that an election is a contest of others is enough to define the Proposed Contracts as both impermissible gaming, and impermissible violations of state law. Id. at 8-12.

In effect, the CFTC argues that the enumerated prohibitions do not merely extend to what people are trading on, but can extend to the act of trading altogether.  This reading fundamentally deviates  from  the  CFTC's  interpretation  of  the  statute  in  other  contexts,  including  in  its  past dealings with Kalshi, and risks undermining the rationale for regulated futures markets altogether.

Consider, for example, the fact that the CFTC, for over a decade, has permitted Kalshi (Number of Hurricanes in 2023? , Kalshi, available at kalshi.com/markets/hurctot/number-of-hurricanes.) and other DCMs (Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Cantor Futures Exchange, L.P: Rule 40.2 New Contract Submission-Atlantic Named Storm Landfall Binary Option Contract Submission #2016-5 , Jun. 13, 2016, available at www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/filings/ptc/16/06/ptc061416 cantordcm001.pdf.) to list contracts that resolve based upon the number of hurricanes that hit in a given  calendar  year.  These  contracts  would  potentially  constitute  unlawful  gaming  in  several states. (See , e.g. , Ala. Code § 13A-12-20 ('A person engages in gambling if he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or someone else will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.' (emphasis added)); S.D. Codified Laws § 22-25A-1  ('For  the  purposes  of  this  chapter,  the  term,  bet  or  wager,  means  to  directly  or indirectly take, receive, or accept money or any valuable thing with the understanding or agreement that the money or valuable thing will be paid or delivered to a person if the payment or delivery is contingent upon the result of a race, contest, or game or upon the happening of an event not known to be certain .' (emphasis added)).) Kalshi has offered contracts on the outcome of the Academy Awards, (Oscar for Best Picture? , Kalshi, kalshi.com/markets/oscarpic/oscars-bestpicture#oscarpic-24 (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).) despite the fact that at least two states have already explicitly regulated these contracts as gaming. (Indiana Allowing Wagers on Who'll Win Oscars next Month , ASSOCIATED PRESS, Jan. 25, 2020, apnews.com/general-news-250e97f04a6e20dcdaf559b29289fcc1; New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement Announces Academy Award Wagering Information , NEW JERSEY OFFICE OF ATTORNEY  GENERAL,  Feb.  10, 2020, www.njoag.gov/new-jersey-division-of-gamingenforcement-announces-academy-award-wagering-information/.) Kalshi offers contracts on weather events in New York City, (Total  snow  in  NYC  this  month? ,  Kalshi,  https://kalshi.com/markets/snownym/totalsnow-in-nyc#snownym-24jan (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).) even though such bets would likely constitute unlawful gaming under New York State law. (See N.Y. Penal Law § 225.00(2) ('A person engages in gambling when he stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome.').)

The CFTC has an obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act to acknowledge and explain its departure from past practices, lest its actions be found to be arbitrary and capricious. Grace v. Barr , 965 F.3d 883, 903 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  This includes an obligation to reconcile the Order's interpretation or application of a statute with the agency's previous interpretations and applications of it.  In its Order, the CFTC fails to acknowledge, let alone explain, why the same logic that found the Proposed Contracts to relate to violations of state laws or gaming deviates so significantly from the statutory interpretation used to permit contracts on weather or the Academy Awards, among others.

The CFTC's attempts to defend this discrepancy is in a footnote.  There, it declares that elections are sometimes referred to as 'contests' and have uncertain economic effects.  Order at 10 n.25.  This footnote is part of a larger section attempting to explain why the Proposed Contracts constitute gaming.  Importantly, though, the CFTC fails to explain why it is applying this standard to Kalshi's Proposed Contracts, and not to other contracts, or even to the act of trading altogether. The Grammy Awards, which the CFTC sees as within the scope of allowable  contracts, (Grammy for Record of the Year? , Kalshi, https://kalshi.com/markets/gramroty/grammyfor-record-of-the-year#gramroty-66 (last visited  Jan. 31, 2024).) may be referred  to  as  contests.    The  CFTC  has  also  permitted  contracts  on  developments  in  Artificial Intelligence, (OpenAI  achieves  AGI  this  year? ,  Kalshi,  https://kalshi.com/markets/oaiagi/openaiachieves-agi#oaiagi (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).) the economic effects of which are fiercely debated. (What Will Artificial Intelligence Mean for Your Pay? , THE ECONOMIST, Nov. 16, 2023, available at www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/11/16/what-will-artificialintelligence-mean-for-your-pay.)

The Commission fails to acknowledge or grapple with the fact that its disapproval of the Proposed Contracts differs from its longstanding practices.  The future sale price of a traditional commodity is clearly a 'contingent event' not in the control of the parties to a futures contract. Under the reasoning the CFTC advances in the Order, nearly every transaction regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act would be in violation of some state gaming laws.

The CFTC's arbitrary interpretation of the relevant statute risks creating havoc in regulated event markets.  If the CFTC were serious about its interpretation of the legal standard articulated in the Order and applied it consistently elsewhere,  it would undermine the rationale for every market regulated under the Commodity Exchange Act, as nearly all futures markets may in some way 'involve' gaming or risk overlapping with state laws.  Nowhere in the Order does the CFTC address the sweeping consequences of the Order's interpretation of the Act.  Nor does the CFTC attempt to reconcile this interpretation with decisions it has made and contracts it has allowed in the past.  The CFTC's Order fails to adequately explain how it is that Kalshi's Proposed Contracts constitute gaming, but other contracts offered on DCMs do not.  Both of these shortcomings define the arbitrary decisionmaking prohibited by the Administrative Procedure Act.  The CFTC must provide the public with a definition of gaming that it can consistently and non-arbitrarily apply to proposed contracts.  It has not done so.

## V. THE COMMISSION MISUNDERSTANDS THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTS

Nor does the Commission's stated concern that approval of the Proposed Contracts could require  the  Commission  to  'investigat[e]  election-related  activities  -  potentially  including  the outcome of an election itself' - support the Commission's decision.  Order at 22.  The concern fundamentally misunderstands the Proposed Contracts that the Commission rejected, is at odds with the Commission's current practices, and is contrary to evidence in the rulemaking record. The Commission's reliance on this reason for rejection of the Proposed Contracts is arbitrary and capricious.

The Contracts in question would resolve based upon the political party affiliation of the individuals who fill two offices at a provided date: those of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate.  Both of these positions are filled, not as a direct result of popular elections, but by votes within their respective chambers. (Office of the Speaker , GOVINFO, Government Publishing Office, www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPRACTICE-108/pdf/GPO-HPRACTICE-108-35.pdf  (last visited  Jan.  30,  2024); President  Pro  Tempore ,  GOVINFO,  Government  Publishing  Office, www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-RIDDICK-1992/pdf/GPO-RIDDICK-1992-107.pdf (last visited Jan. 30, 2024).) Notably, PredictIt has run markets-within the same election cycle-on both the ultimate partisan composition of any given chamber of Congress, (Which party will win the House in the 2022 election? , Predictit, https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/6892/Which-party-will-win-the-House-in-the-2022election (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).) and on the election of the Speaker of the House. (Who will be Speaker of the House of Representatives in the next Congress? , Predictit, https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7326/Who-will-be-Speaker-of-the-House-ofRepresentatives-in-the-next-Congress (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).) The prices for these two markets do not always correlate. (On January 3, 2023, for example, PredictIt shares of Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries traded as high as $.07, indicating that Republican Leader McCarthy's failure to earn the necessary votes created a 7% chance that the Republican-majority House would elect a Democratic Speaker. See Who will be Speaker of the House of Representatives in the next Congress? , PredictIt, https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/7326/Who-will-be-Speaker-of-the-House-ofRepresentatives-in-the-next-Congress.)

Any claim of impropriety in an election, made in good faith or otherwise, would simply not be relevant to the resolution of these contracts, and would not require the CFTC to conduct an investigation regarding the results of an election.

This is exactly how the CFTC has treated other contracts run on Kalshi in the past, and the CFTC has not articulated why these contracts are distinct from contracts on the passage of the Bipartisan Innovation Act (Bipartisan Innovation Act by election day? , Kalshi, https://kalshi.com/markets/usica/bipartisan-innovation-act#usica (last visited Jan. 31, 2024).) or a NEPA Permitting Reform Bill, (NEPA permitting reform bill by January 02, 2023? , Kalshi, https://kalshi.com/markets/nepa/nepa-permitting-reform-bill#nepa-23jan02  (last  visited  Jan.  31, 2024).) among others.  These contracts, which  were  offered  without  objection  from  the  CFTC,  similarly  resolve  based  upon  votes  of members of the United States House of Representatives and United States Senate, without regard to any claim relating to the election of any given member.

## CONCLUSION

The CFTC's Order is arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise contrary to law.  The Order is an anomaly in the current regulatory environment, and the CFTC fails to explain why its treatment of the Proposed Contracts deviates so substantially from that of other contracts put before it.  The Order's conclusion that the Proposed Contracts lack an economic purpose is both unexplained and out  of  line  with  the  evidence  put  before  the  Commission.    The  Order  misapplies  the  statutemandated text, and proceeds to misunderstand both the value and the nature of the contracts.  For these  reasons,  the  Court  should  determine  that  the  Order  is  arbitrary  and  capricious,  hold  it unlawful, and set it aside under 5 U.S.C. § 706.
