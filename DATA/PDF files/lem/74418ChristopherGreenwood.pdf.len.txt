the

it

a

well
there
be
no

to

that

somehow
not

this
indeed
the

be
well
aware
of

ability
to
enforce

additionally
it
be
not
clear
why
kalshi
ability
to
enforce
a
rule
be
appropriate
for
public
comment
how
be
a
member
of
the
public
suppose
to
have
information
on
kalshi
system
and
procedure
and
internal
process
for
compliance
it
would
seem
that
the
most
appropriate
party
to
address
this
question
to
be
kalshi
and
kalshi
note
that
surprisingly
and
incongruously
the
commission
have
never
ask
kalshi
this
question
3
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
whether
take
a
position
on
election
or
congressional
control
be
define
as
game
under
state
or
federal
law
1
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
no
the
commission
should
not
consider
this
in
determine
whether
a
contract
be
gaming
and
subject
to
the
special
rule
for
event
contract
for
four
reason
1
presence
on
an
illegal
exchange
casino
or
sportsbook
do
not
by
right
cause
relation
to
gaming
for
example
if
corn
future
become
widely
trade
in
casino
and
sport
book
that
would
not
change
the
nature
of
the
corn
future
contract
into
a
gaming
contract
the
converse
be
also
true
if
a
traditional
future
exchange
start
a
roulette
parlor
the
bet
in
the
parlor
would
still
be
game
2
what
be
offer
at
such
venue
change
over
time
for
example
if
we
use
this
nature
of
the
venue
determine
nature
of
the
product
standard
many
commodity
future
and
security
might
have
originally
be
consider
game
because
bucket
shop
trade
those
product
in
large
volume
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
century
they
may
have
continue
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
bucket
shop
prohibition
3
the
commission
prevent
congressional
control
contract
from
be
list
on
exchange
in
the
nadex
order
it
would
be
circular
to
use
the
fact
that
such
activity
have
persist
off
exchange
as
evidence
the
activity
be
game
for
example
if
the
commission
prohibit
oil
future
and
oil
future
trading
move
to
casino
that
would
not
suddenly
change
the
economic
nature
of
oil
future
4
the
commission
do
not
consider
the
venue
offer
for
example
bitcoin
contract
prior
to
the
listing
of
bitcoin
contract
on
dcms
if
the
commission
consider
this
inquiry
to
be
dispositive
that
something
be
game
those
contract
would
be
game
contract
because
of
their
large
presence
on
such
venue
however
even
if
the
commission
do
consider
venue
as
relevant
in
determine
whether
the
contract
involve
game
congressional
control
be
not
offer
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
and
be
not
available
in
casino
like
those
in
las
vegas
mcintre

they
will
take
your
bet
on
the
election
in

bet
on
the
control
of
congress
be
accept
at
caesar
palace
or
the
bellagio
such
contract
be
only
currently
offer
on
some
overseas
bet
service
and
illegal
or
unregulated
venue
in
the
united
states
instead
of
consider
venue
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
subject
of
the
contract
involve
gaming
when
adjudicate
whether
a
contract
involve
gaming
per
kalshi
letter
on
the
special

should
the
commission
consider
take
a
position
on
election
or
congressional
control
be
define
as
game
under
state
or
federal
law
no
for
two
reason
first
because
per
the
special
rule
only
the
underlying
event
congressional
control
should
be
consider
in
determine
whether
the

not
equivalent
to
as
state
or
the
federal
government
may
define
it
wager
or

which
they

this
be
not
true
legally
interstate

in

as
father

richard
sandor
write
in
his
comment
letter
a
major
misconception
that
still
prevail
among
the
public
be
the
equivalence
of
gambling
and
speculation
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
gambling
be
an
artificial
self
construct
risk
create
for
recreation
speculation
be
the
assumption
of
risk
that
already
exist
in
the
real
and
financial
market
the
recreational
risk
of
gambling
be
not
present
until
the
casino
or
racetrack
be
build
and
wager
be
accept
on
the
other
hand
risk
in
the
production
of
good
and
service
in
the
economy
be
real
and
will
exist
even
in
the
absence
of
future
market
the
same
can
be
say
for
equity
and
interest
rate
and
risk
it
seem
reasonable
to
conclude
the
risk
associate
with
policy
change
from
different
election
outcome
be
most
similar
to
the
latter
the
transfer
of
risk
by
hedger
would
be
real
and
the
assumption
of
that
risk
by
speculator
would
be
proper

so
any

that

would
be
preempt
the

also

even

that

still
preempt

law
per
the
cfma
ibid
it
could
not
follow
more
plainly
that
cftc
regulate
derivative
have
the
same
preemptive
effect
congress
have
repeatedly
recognize
that
future
and
other
derivative
contract
serve
economic
purpose
and
therefore
state
law
that
purport
to
prohibit
or
regulate
future
or
derivative
contract
include
gaming
law
do
not
violate
the
cea
and
be
preempt
all
of
this
show
that
congress
and
the
state
understand
that
there
be
a
critical
distinction
between
bet
and
legitimate
financial
activity
election
contract
that
be
design
for
hedge
on
a
financial
market
constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
consider
the
contract
as
involve
unlawful
activity
as
these
law
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to
contract
like
kalshi
a
key
purpose
of
the
cea
and
grant
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
future
be
to
authorize
and
promote
trading
of
future
contract
notwithstanding
state
law
that
might
purport
to
prohibit
they
as
gamble
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
be
relevant
be
if
the
activity
underlie
the
event
contract
violate
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evasion
in
that
case
congress
want
to
make
sure
that
a
future
contract
would
not
legitimize
that
activity
without
the
commission
consider
whether
trade
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
obviously
would
not
be
concern
about
legitimize
election
even
if
the
focus
come
to
legitimize
the
trading
on
election
as
part
of
the
ultimate
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
have
already
cross
that
bridge
by
long
permit
market
participant
to
trade
such
contract
pursuant
to
no
action
letter
award
to
unregulated
market
the
notion
that
allow
a
regulated
exchange
to
offer
the
contract
be
what
change
the
public
interest
analysis
be
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
bet
the
wire
act
be
irrelevant
here
it
apply
only
to
sport
bet
and
wager
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
address
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the
internet
it
carve
out
derivative
contract
both
on
exchange
and
over
the
counter
from
the
definition
of
bet
and
wager
thereby
plainly
recognize
that
derivative
contract
serve
economic
purpose
that
distinguish
they
from

of

congress

alone
to

it

an

that

determine
whether

it
be

that

would
disagree
that
its

core

lead

the

the
question
be
whether

remain
just

shadow
market
this
be
of

not
a

to

independently
of

economic
utility

it
be
an
undeniably

in

the

need
this
product
fill
1
should
the

review
a

there
be
no
requirement
from

nor
mechanism
by
which
the

can
or
should
determine
hedge

as
a

on

outside

a

can
be
consider
as

as

what

should

theoretical
use
or

a

may
be
an
important
consideration
in

should
the

promote

mitigation
be
a

of

the

note
however
that
these
two

theoretical
versus

be
more
like
opposite
end
of
a
spectrum
and
there
be
variation
in
between
it

a
theoretical

standard
a
demonstrate

standard
could

the
creation
of

with
small

less
clear
market
have
no
clear
mechanism
by
which
it
can
be
determine
and
because
a
contract
only
theoretically
be
use
for
hedging
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
should
not
be
miss
that
the
standard
imply
in
the
last
part
of
this
question
some
minimum
require
amount
of
hedging
in
absolute
or
percentage
term
would
be
likely
to
have
unintended
consequence
if
impose

this
standard

case
for

to

themselves
without

none

would
be

and
thus
as

as

improve
a

even
in

the

a

if
they
know
it
will
be
hard
for

later
if

so
the

of

willing

volume
be
essential
to
encourage
the
original
round
of

to

since

the

can

either
that

directly
on

that

or
that

can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedge
utility
via
a
melange
of
other

assume
the
former
the
answer
be
yes
there
be
risk
that
can
not
be
currently
hedge

as
note
by

and

and
in
the

there
be
significant

such
as
the

outcome
on
the
fortune
of
medium
personality
medium
consultant
and
other
with

and
tie
to
the

in

these
risk
can
not
be
otherwise
hedge
by
traditional
product
as
discuss
early
change
in
general
risk
that
a
certain
congress
could
pose
to
various
industry
can
be
discern
well
in
advance
of
knowledge
of
the
particular
policy
that
may
be
implement
by
that
congress
and
provide
just
as
valid
a
hedge
rationale
this
difference
result
from
the
time
horizon
between
the
election
cycle
and
the
implementation
of
a
new
congress
specific
legislative
agenda
or
its
potential
response
to
current
event
for
example
follow
the
election
of
republicans
into
congress
in
2016
many
publication
speculate
that
trade
policy
would
become
more
restrictive
however
it
be
not
know
if
this
would
come
in
the
form
of

if
so
on
what
good
and
at
what
level
international

and
more
another

contract
or
future
on
taxis
or
public
policy
would
not
have
be
very
helpful
however
the
risk
of
a
more
restrictive
policy
be
there
because
of
who
would
win
the
election
exactly
what
kalshi
contract
allow
trader
to
hedge
another
example
be
new

that
would
burden
a

participant
once
the

draft

the
impact
will
begin
to
be
feel
immediately
on

cash

and

as

price

the

risk
have

of
its

market

participant
may

risk
from

many
firm
and

be

affect
by
a
suite
of
a

policy
and
thus
wish
to
hedge
the
many
different
change
in
risk
through
a
single
contract
for
example
an
oil
company
may
wish
to
hedge
the
risk
that
a
new
democratic
government
will
come
into
office
because
that
government
could
not
only
impose

also

for

only
kalshi
proposal
let
they
hedge
the
risk
they
actually
face
democratic
government
if
the
question
be
ask
instead
whether
market
participant
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedge
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instrument
the
answer
be
they
can
not
many
retail
and
small
business
market
participant
do
not
have
access
to
these
other
instrument
and
the
inherent
friction
and
transaction
cost
in
arrange
these
type
of
complex
proxy
play
be
prohibitive
it
seem
unlikely
that
the
commission
would
determine
it
in
the
public
interest
to
solely
rely
on
these
tool
that
be
inaccessible
to
many
of
the
market
participant
who
need
risk
management
tool
most
additionally
the
effectiveness
of
these
basket
and
combination
of
instrument
to
hedge
the
risk
from
political
control
be
considerably
less
than
a
contract
directly
on
political
control
importantly
the
question
imply
that
its
answer
matter
but
do
not
explain
why
it
would
a
reasonable
inference
be
that
the
commission
be
say
no
new
method
of
hedge
a
risk
should
be
permit
if
there
be
other
exist
method
of
hedge
that
risk
nowhere
in
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulation
be
there
such
a
standard
the
exchange
hop
this
be
not
the
commission
view
as
it
have
not
be
the
exchange
experience
when
engage
with
the
commission
on
prior
contract
for
example
should
the
commission
say
farmer
can
buy
crop
insurance
therefore
they
should
not
have
access
to
agricultural
future
product
furthermore
such
an
interpretation
would
be
highly
anti
competitive
such
an
interpretation
would
mean
that
if
one
firm
offer
a
contract
on
an
event
or
a
commodity
that
no
challenger
should
enter
the
market
with
a
similar
but
different
product
to
compete
with
it
in
fact
such
an
interpretation
would
consistently
punish
novel
or
innovative
product
in
many
case
it
be
possible
to
construct
a
hedge
use
exist
product
and
attempt
to
do
so
might
be
expensive
or
incur
excess
basis
risk
the
fact
that
election
risk
have
implication
for
other
asset
be
in
fact
much
of
the
justification
for
the
contract
hedge
utility
and
would
work
in
concert
with
such
asset
many
similar
and
compete
product
be
list
by
different
exchange
in
order
to
promote
a
vibrant
and
competitive
marketplace
for
hedger
this
be
also
an
important
component
of
the
contract
price
discovery
utility
discuss
in
a
later
question
such
an
interpretation
would
also
curtail
innovation
innovation
often
happen
through
iterate
on
already
successful
product
and
idea
as
in
the
early
example
the
existence
of
insurance
product
would
have
inhibit
the
creation
of
future
innovation
often
require
create
new
and
sometimes
flawed
product
in

to
try

optimize

case
for
market
participant
hedger
benefit
when
many

they
suffer
when
the
government
limit
their
option
it
in
the
public
interest
for
such
innovation
to
occur
and
for
that
to
happen
the
commission
should
not
take
the
view
that
this
product
should
not
be

because
it
purportedly
can
be

in

the
hedge
benefit
be
obvious
since
I
no
long
employ
through
my
union
my
wife
no
long
have
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seem
that
republicans
be
likely
to
take
control
I
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premium
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
small
or
that

although
some

claim
election

enough
to
be
a

those
who

the

those

see

they
can
not

give

that
all
the
people
who
identify
how
they
would
use
the

manage

be
mistaken
or
deficient
in
their
ability
to
recognize

and
potential
tool
to
manage
or
mitigate
that

it
would
be
arbitrary
for
the

to

only
to
those
who
assert
that
there

who
state
that

by

there
be
sufficient

the

show

even
if

it

still
easily
pass
the

there
be
one
area
where
the
full

requirement
become
relevant
and
that
be
in

to
responsible
innovation
as
a
foray
into
quasi
new
territory
it
make
sense
that
the
exchange
have
certify
only
a
fully
collateralized
product
this
requirement
will
prevent
excessive
leveraging
and
while
it
certainly
may
be
appropriate
to
have
margin
product
on
this
in
the
future
as
an
initial

it
be
prudent
and
sensible
to
maintain
kalshi

that

indeed
kalshi
should

there

it

to
determine
whether

not
a

be
appropriate
for

not
the

if
the

be
a
poor
fit
for

need
which
it
do
not
appear
to
be
especially
give
the
many
public

by
retail
small
business
and

in

then
kalshi
will
attract

in

will

structure
to
improve
the

of
the

and
hedger
be
align
substitute
the

judgment
for
the

would
short
circuit
that
valuable
process
accordingly
the
commission
inquiry
into
hedging
as
part
of
its
public

inquiry
should
be
whether
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
as
note
however
the
contract
here
have
significant
hedging
utility
that
would
pass
any
of
these
test
moreover
different
firm
have
different
hedging
need
and
different
structure
can
well
meet
those
need
what
work
for
one
firm
may
not
work
well
for
another
firm
as
a
result
the
commission
should
not
attempt
to
speculate
about
whether
a
particular
structure
would
work
as
they
may
miss
many
firm
for
whom
an
alternative
structure
be
well
the
utility
of
the
market
be
that
there
exist
a
profit
incentive
to
create
product
for
even
niche
group
of
buyer
and
insofar
as
private
firm
be
far
close

their

base
than
a
government
agency
which
do
not
interact
with
they
on
a

basis
unlike
an

it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
for
the
commission
to
impose
its
judgment
about
whether
a

meet

need
it

this

one
may

imagine

to

thus

this

have
be
test
several
time
by

who
have
conclude
that
all

have
fail
koleman

strumpf
in

examine

find
that
no

be
capable
of
sustain
anything
more
than

they

we
find

moreover
the

thus
even
more
prone
to

than
a

like

a

manipulation
on

be

indeed

find
one
major
reason
why

the

the
reasoning
roughly
track
as
follow
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
conflate
their
belief
as
preference
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
be
definitely
go
to
win
the
2024
presidential
election
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenge
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odd
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
express
belief
as
mere
signal
lend
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
be
at
stake
they
be
able
to
differentiate
their
belief
from
their
preference
in
other
word
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrink
and
individual
who
trade
on
election
market
become
more
attune
to
fact
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
in
conclusion
the
contract
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
it
strongly
support
the
public
interest
as
demonstrate
by
the
evidence
above
the
contract
will
improve
asset

provide

enhance

integrity

to
suit
this
question
1
the
contract
will
not
harm
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of

integrity
it
be
important
for
the
commission
to
engage
with
the
evidence
on
election
integrity
rather
than
speculate
the
nadex
order
suggestion
that
voter
could
be
incentivize
to
switch
their
vote
and
thus
harm
election
integrity
be
outright
speculative
in

and
have
since
be
disproven
by

success
without
any
claim
of
let

drive
by
those

political

what
experience

really
do

allow

if
anything
they
heighten

engagement

chief

of

even

and
for
that
brief
period
whenever
blowhard
partisan
insist
that
some
outcome
be
go
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on
the

and
ask
they
why
they
think
that
price
be
wrong
and
whether
they
actually
put
their

it

specifically
the

I
be
confident

they

similar

not

exist
in

chance
in

to
flatter
the

of
their

second
pundit
may
want
to
directly
contradict
a
so
call
mainstream
line
about
a
candidate
win
in
order
to
gin
up
controversy
and
draw
more
click

viewership
as
a
result
they
may
claim
an

the
true
favorite
and
to
further
court
controversy
and
viewership
claim
that

the
contrary

a
function
of
fraud
and
deception
third
even
when

attempt
to
be
honest
viewer
themselves
may
seek
out
information
that
confirm
their

the
reasoning
roughly
track
as
follow
when
no

people
conflate
their

a

partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a

be
definitely
go
to
win
the
2024
presidential
election
this

a
belief
when
in

they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the

a
preference
however
that

individual
when
challenge
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odd
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
be
at

people
express
belief
as
mere
signal
lend
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
be
at

they
be
able
to
differentiate
their
belief
from
their
preference
in
other
word
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrink
and
individual
who
trade
on
election
market
become
more
attune
to
fact
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
empower
researcher
and
policymaker
one
of
the
most
exciting
application
of

event
contract
be
their
ability
to
provide
powerful
new
causal
inference
tool
to
researcher
and
policymaker
right
now
estimate
the
effect
of

be
rather
difficult
one
can
not
merely
compare
economic
outcome
during

presidential

the
underlie

have
dramatically
change
likewise
compare

run
into

problem
include
that

be
close

and
that
the

have
already

in
some
probability
of
the
eventual
victor

enter
political

if

x
have
a
80
percent
chance
of
win
and
then
when
they
actually
win
on

night
a
stock
go
up

we
can
say
that
the
total
effect
of
the

be
5
percentage
point
if
go
from
80
to
100
be
1
then
go
from
0
to
100
be
roughly
5
but
it
can
get
even
strong
since
researcher
would
now
have
a
time
series
of
how
the
probability
change
over
time
they
can
use

the

this
serve

to

the

wish
as

at

early
in
this
response
and
in
kalshi
original
filing
american
election
be
not
readily
susceptible
to

in
fact
manipulation
of
which

control
the
congress
have
never
occur
this
be
in
contrast
to
exist
market
that
the
cftc
regulate
indeed
the
cftc
have
bring
numerous
enforcement
action
against
market
participant
who
either
manipulate
or
attempt
to
manipulate
market
in
oil
precious
metal
cattle
and
other
commodity
spot
and
future
market
the
commission
regularly
bring
almost
a
hundred
enforcement
action
per
year
and
order
billion
in
monetary
relief
then
of
course
there
be
digital
asset
market
where
the
commission
have
bring
dozen
of
action
in
an
incredibly
short
time
contrast
that
with
election
where
election
or
voter
fraud
be
extremely
rare
and
never
succeed
at
flip
the
outcome
of
which
party
control
congress
even
in
case
where
election
manipulation
have
be
attempt
it
have
only
succeed
in

extremely
small
local

any
attempt
to

the

would
most
certainly
involve
a
high
degree
of
speculation
the

be
in
regard
to
the
sum
of

it
be
not
even
possible

the

and
thus
easy

machine
themselves

quixotic
take
all

it

considerably
less

in

area
that
fall

critically
there
be
already
enormous
stake
in

create

for

manipulation
this

will
not
change
that
fact
as
discuss
in

in

in

and
to
anyone

the

what

the

20
should

if
so
how
would
the

the

take

to

possible

false

activity
involve
the

information
for
the

while
the
contract
be
trade
the
exchange
have
already
take
great
step
to
prevent
and
address
manipulative
behavior
as
in
some
of
the
prior
question
it
seem
odd
for
the
commission
to
request
only
the
public
input
in
this
regard
but
have
not
discuss
this
with
kalshi
regardless
the
exchange
have
numerous
safeguard
in
place
to
prevent
manipulation
additionally
the
exchange
note
that
in
particular
concern
regard
manipulate
this
contract
be
broadly
unlikely
the
market
for
credible
information
on

and
their

be
very
competitive
and
false

be
equally
as

the

make

that

it

this
be
no
different
it
be
also
important
to
note
what
the
correct
legal
standard
be
which
be
not
free
from
attempt

indeed
one
need
only
to
peruse
the
annal
of
the
cftc
enforcement
action
to
find
many
contract
that

manipulate
libor
or
the
subject
of
an
attempt

these
event
contract
such
as
oil
contract
interest
rate
swap
etc
be
significantly
more
likely
and
susceptible
to
be
manipulate
than
this
contract
indeed
the
fact
that
a
contract
like
this
on
a
regulated
market
be
so
unlikely
to
be
manipulate
successfully
be
one
of
the
reason
that
the
public
be
so
keen
on
see
the

which
will
be
far
more
reliable
than

do

an
actor
could
have
be
highly
unlikely
to
be
material
regard
the
outcome
of
in
total
several
hundred
congressional
race
it
be
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
argument
that
congressional
control
can
come
down
to
the
outcome
of
a
handful
of
race
and
some
race
can
be
decide
by
a
margin
of
several
thousand
hundred
or
even
individual
vote
have
little
to
no
bearing
on
the
contract
susceptibility
to
manipulation
the
margin
of
victory
before
an
election
be
unknown
if
a
nefarious
actor
attempt
to
manipulate
the
election
in
order
to
manipulate
the
contract
which
be
what
the
cftc
be
ask
in
this
question
the
actor
would
not
know
beforehand
what
the
margin
of
victory
would
be
that
nefarious
actor
would
have
to
assess
the
size
of
the
electorate
which
be
in
every
instance
go
to
be
large
accordingly
it
be
hard
to
conceive
of
the
definitive
piece
of
material
non
public
information
that
will
swing
the
outcome
of
the
contract
however
like
all
contract
on
kalshi
there
be
a
prohibition
to
trade
on
material
nonpublic
information
this
contract
be
no
different
in
that
regard
in
response
to
various
indication
from
the
commission
however
the
exchange
adopt
contract
specific
rule
for
this
contract
to
gate
out
certain
people
who
would
be
more
likely
to
have
information
that
could
be
consider
material
nonpublic
information
this
gate
itself
be
the
proverbial
safeguard
on
a
safeguard
as
in
other
question
kalshi
note
the
incongruity
of
ask
the
public
for
input
on
how
kalshi
will
enforce
a
rule
without
having
ask
kalshi
regardless
this
rule
be
enforceable
22
should
the
commission
be
responsible
for
surveille
and
enforce
against
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involve
the
price
form
information
for
the
contract
while
the
contract
be
trade
it
should
be
responsible
for
surveille
and
enforce
against
manipulative
and
false
reporting
activity
while
the
contract
be
live
as
much
as
it
be
responsible
for
do
so
with
other
list
contract
no
more
no
less
furth
the
exchange
note
that
one
of
the
benefit
of
have
this
activity
on
a
regulated
exchange
be
that
the
commission
will
for
the
first
time
gain
insight
into
the
amount
and
level
of
activity
of
trading
on
congressional
control
currently
if
for
example
congress
would
invite
the
cftc
to
the
hill
and
ask
the
cftc
to
describe
the
current
financial
activity
on
congressional
control
the
cftc
will
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
there
be
activity
some
on
otc
some
on
unregulated
market
some
overseas
when
press
for
detail
on
who
be
participate
the
cftc
will
have
to
confess
its
utter
ignorance
however
if
the
contract
be
to
trade
on
regulate
exchange
the
cftc
will
not
only
know
precisely
what
position
be
be
take
on
the
regulated
market
they
will
know
who
be
take
they
23
could
trade
in
the
market
for
the
contract
obligate
the
commission
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
if
so
be
this
an
appropriate
role
for
the
commission
there
be
no
reason
for
the
commission
to
believe
it
will
be
responsible
for
police
attempt
at
or
successful
election
fraud
no
more
and
no
less
than
the
cftc
be
responsible
for
any
other
type
of
underlie
fraud
that
have
impact
on
a
contract
early
this
year
there
be
two
individual
who
be
arrest
for
attempt
to
destroy
power
station
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
destroy
the
city
of
baltimore
if
successful
the
sabotage
would
have
impact
electricity
price
significantly
be
the
cftc
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
prosecution
of
these
two
individual
be
the
cftc
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
protecting
of
america
power
grid
impact
the
price
of
global
oil
include
the
future
market
that
the
cftc
regulate
be
the
cftc
therefore
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
meeting
be
the
cftc
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
determination
of
corporate
dividend
that
underlie
the
cme
contract
the
answer
to
all
of
these
be
that
the
cftc
will
get
involve
to
the
extent
that
it
be
necessary
for
it
to
administer
and
enforce
the
cea
the
cftc
do
not
in
any
of
these
case
assume
the
role
of
the
cop
on
the
beat
this
application
here
be
no
different
election
manipulation
be
a
crime
there
be
law
enforcement
agency
who
police
election
and
election
be
police
much
more
effectively
than
other
market
that
have
cftc
derivative
product
trade
on
they
the
commission
be
not
the
only
cop
on
the
beat
with
regard
to
election
fraud
election
unlike
many
other
reference
market
or
event
that
have
cftc
derivative
trade
on
they
be
govern
by
multiple
law
enforcement
agency
whose
very
existence
be
to
prevent
and
detect
election
manipulation
and
fraud
this
include
the
federal
election
commission
the
federal
department
of
justice
state
election
commission
state
secretary
of
state
and
state
ethic
commission
history
have
show
that
these
agency
be
very
good
at
their
job
the
other
day
the
cftc
bring
an
enforcement
charge
against
alexander

and
celsius

where
the

acknowledge
the

that

by
both

similarly
cody

the
cftc
also
charge

presumably
after
cooperate
with
the
relevant
criminal

these
be
two
example
of
many
the
cftc
be
well
verse
in
cooperate
with
the
relevant
law
enforcement
agency
be
it
the
fbi
or
doj
or
any
other
relevant
federal
or
state
authority
there
be
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
cftc
would
somehow
lose
that
competency
in
this
case
24
what
other
factor
should
the
commission
consider
in
determine
whether
these
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
have
never
fully
define
the
full
extent
of
the
factor
it
consider
under
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
even
the
nadex
order
admit
that
the
commission
can
consider
factor
other
than
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
be
not
an
expert
in
all
area
such
as
election
law
or
integrity
voter
confidence
or
how
to
foster
democracy
and
the
commission
should
instead
focus
on
what
it
know
the
value
of
a
contract
as
a
hedge
interest
and
the
value
of
a
contract
price
to
market
participant
as
we
note
in
response
early
these
contract
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
have
a
large
economic
purpose
would
serve
as
a
useful
tool
for
voter
the
medium
and
the
public
that
would
fight
information
and
improve
election
integrity
we
note
that
the
evidence
support
the
contract
be
wholly
consistent
with
the
state
finding
and
purpose
of
the

these

finally

in

business
face

of
potential
harm
that

these
potential

risk
include

access

possible

each
one
of
these
general
category
of

impact
each
business
accord
to
the

unique
activity
profile

et

in
addition

these
example
there
be
many
more
category
of
risk
include
strategic
risk
getting
outcompete
by
a
competitor
reputation
risk
liability
risk
and
beyond
there
be
three
step
that
business
generally
follow
when
they
be
manage
the
risk
of
harm
the
first
step
be
to
identify
the
risk
impact
mean
the
various
place
where
the
business
can
suffer
such
as
its
income
or
valuation
the
second
step
be
for
the
business
to
assess
how
likely
it
be
that
the
potential
harm
will
materialize
and
how
severe
or
acute
will
the
impact
of
these
harm
be
in
order
to
do
that
the
business
must
consider
the
factor
that
can
affect
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
the
risk
these
include
market
condition
and
all
relate
factor
that
can
have
a
bearing
on
the
potential
harm
this
three
step
process
characterize
an
appropriate
risk
management
framework
it
work
for
all
manner
of
risk
to
illustrate
a
business
might
identify
that
a
decline
in
profit
margin
be
a
harm
that
it
face
one
of
the
many
factor
that
could
cause
this
harm
be
change
in
demand
for
its
product
that
will
change
what
it
can
charge
the
business
will
stop
there
though
it
will
identify
what
trend
or
event
will
create
a
change
in
demand
for
its
product
for
example
the
business
will
consider
what
market
force
impact
its
core
customer
base
a
slowdown
in
that
sector
might
have
a
correspond
downward
impact
on
the
demand
for
the
business
product
to
illustrate
consider
a
builder
of
extra
large
river
barge
in
the
upper
midwest
they
know
that
change
in
demand
impact
their
risk
but
they
need
to
know
what
affect
demand
naturally
they
look
to
key
factor
such
as
low
grain
yield
in
the
upper
mississippi
river
v
alley
as
low
grain
yield
may
mean
low
need
for
river
barge
both
of
these
be
factor
that
will
impact
the
acuteness
of
the
risk
whether
the
harm
be
likely
to
happen
and
how
severe
it
will
be
if
it
do
happen
as
a
result
they
may
purchase
short
contract
on
grain
future
in
order
to
hedge
their
risk
similarly
many
business
face
potential
harm
that
be
impact
by
inflation
inflation
can
impact
nearly
all
term
contract
impact
the
business
real
cost
for
instance
a
firm
lock
into
a
10
year
commercial
lease
on
their
office
space
will
see
low
real
cost
as
a
result
of
inflation
than
with
a
short
lease
however
if
the
company
be
also
a
supplier
and
have
lock
in
their
sale
contract
they
have
agree
to
sell
ton
of
fertilizer
at
900
ton
then
the
real
value
of
those
sale
decline
and
inflation
will
harm
they
of
course
inflation
affect
many
other
risk
as
well
high
inflation
raise
the
probability
that
the
federal
reserve
raise
its
target
interest
rate
which
tend
to
substantially
reduce
stock
valuation
and
the
value
of
asset
the
price
of
a
stock
be
often
consider
the
discount
present
value
of
future
dividend
when
the
interest
rate
the
discount
rate
go
up
then
the
present
value
of
future
dividend
decline
and
thus
the
stock
value
decline
in
simple
term
when
the
interest
rate
go
up
it
raise
the
relative
value
of
present
money
over
future
profit
so
an
asset
that
incur
cost
in
the
short
run
but
profit
in
the
long
run
be
less
valuable
when
interest
rate
be
high
a
stock
which
cost
money
in
the
short
run
but
may
generate
dividend
in
the
long
run
be
thus
less
valuable
when
interest
rate
rise
that
doubly
true
for
growth
stock
that
may
be
generate
no
profit
now
but
may
generate
they
5
10
year
from
now
inflation
be
just
one
of
many
example
of
factor
that
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
potential
harm
to
mitigate
those
risk
they
may
seek
to
purchase
any
one
of
many
inflation
hedge
such
as
inflation
swap
inflation
protect
treasury
or
inflation
event
contract
application
to
political
control
contract
political
control
represent
another
factor
that
could
impact
a
company
risk
profile
much
like
inflation
firm
use
the
same
risk
management
strategy
as
before
a
company
first
identify
harm
operational
reputational
valuation
credit
and
more
and
then
identify
the
way
those
risk
could
change
the
aforementioned
fertilizer
company
may
be
purchase
fertilizer
input
like
potash
from
other
country
potash
be
often
find
in
russia
belarus
and
china
and
identify
their
large
operational
risk
as
disruption
in
the
global
potash
supply
chain
they
far
identify
that
change
in
congressional
political
control
could
increase
the
probability
that
the
supply
chain
be
disrupt
since
different
congress
may
take
different
approach
to
tariff
sanction
and
other
trade
relate
policy
the
election
of
a
new
congress
skeptical
about
status
quo
policy
will
immediately
impact
their
business
by
reduce
the
expect
revenue
of
current
investment
new
investment
and
make
partner
and
investor
skittish
as
a
result
change
in
political
control
directly
increase
or
decrease
the
firm
operational
risk
perhaps
the
clear
example
of
this
description
of
risk
management
come
from
the
cftc
report
manage
climate

the

that
not

something
that

that

those
be

the

they

some
other
risk
be
enumerate
below
increase
in
transportation
cost
which
could
affect
the
cost
of
transport
specialized
boring

this
may
occur
due
to
increase
in
trucking
rate
or
change
in
gas
diesel
price
for
illustration
let
we
say
that
every
1
increase
in
transportation
cost
cost
the
firm
change
in
the
price
they
can
sell
their
good
which
could
occur
due
to
rise
energy
price
or
government
rebate
for
example
suppose
a
1
increase
in
energy
cost
increase
firm
profit
by
a
shift
in
the
demand
curve
for
their
service
there
be
a
subtle
but
important
distinction
between
change
in
service
demand
due
to
low
price
which
in
economic
term
would
be
consider
a
move
along
the
same
demand
curve
and
a
shift
in
the
demand
curve
whereby
demand
be
different
even
if
the
price
remain
the
same
as
before
this
scenario
could
occur
due
to
change
in
environmental
rule
induce
more
industrial
firm
to
purchase
zero
carbon
electricity
or
change
in
subsidy
and
tax
credit
that
make
their
product
more
affordable
for
firm
when
compare
to
fossil
fuel
service
suppose
a
ceteris
paribus
1
increase
in
demand
would
increase
firm
profit
by
change
in
retain
profit
this
could
occur
due
to
change
revenue
change
cost
but
also
change
corporate
tax
rate
include
marginal
rate
and
depreciation
treatment
suppose
reverse
the
2017
tax
cut
would
all
else
equal
increase
firm
cost
by
5
million
change
in
expansion
opportunity
this
could
occur
due
to
change
in
permit
standard
that
may
affect
the
speed
at
which
the
firm
can
develop
new
geothermal
site
or
change
in
environmental
standard
may
affect
which
site
can
be
develop
change
in
expansion
cost
this
may
occur
due
to
change
in
interest
rate
may
affect
the
cost
of
finance
new

or
change
litigation
cost
from
nepa
rule
that
affect
whether
local
group
can
sue
to
stop
a
new
site
development
the
firm
will
assess
what
be
the
factor
that
will
impact
each
of
their
potential
harm
factor
that
can
impact
the
likelihood
of
harm
materializing
and
factor
that
can
impact
the
severity
of
harm
should
they
materialize
not
every
harm
will
be
directly
impact
by
election
and
political
control
and
the
contract
will
not
be
a
part
of
every
hedge
strategy
look
at
the
transportation
cost
variable
for
instance
the
firm
may
decide
that
trucking
rate
be
likely
unaffected
by
change
in
congressional
control
though
in
2022
congress
vote
on
the
freight
rail
strike
do
likely
affect
trucking
price
a
firm
may
not
consider
this
frequent
enough
to
be
worth
calculate
and
gas
price
while
relate
to
political
variable
be
not
easily
anticipate
by
change
in
congressional
majority
regard
their
output
price
while
wholesale
energy
price
be
certainly
influence
by
political
variable
the
firm
may
determine
that
the
relationship
to
election
be
too
attenuate
to
evaluate
likewise
while
permit
standard
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act
be
a
top
priority
for
the
118th
congress
it
widely
view
as
a
bipartisan
priority
and
thus
unlikely
to
change
regardless
of
how
political
condition
evolve
but
the
business
may
determine
that
other
potential
harm
will
be
directly
impact
by
election
and
political
control
for
example
retain
profit
and
shift
in
the

curve
be
influence
by
which
party

as
party
have
substantially
different
position
on
corporate
taxis
zero
carbon

and
emission
standard
for

as
a
result
depend
on
how
the
congressional
election
play
out
certain
risk
become
more
salient
mitigatory
action
may
be
insufficient
the
firm
can
not
cost
efficiently
diversify
into
fossil
fuel
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
clean
energy
subsidy
policy
in
the
same
way
a
corn
farmer
can
not
cost
efficiently
diversify
into
an
uncorrelated
domain
in
order
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
agriculture
price
a
firm
may
conduct
some
simple
math
a
give
party

may
increase
the
probability
of

tax
change
by

create
an
expectation
of

20
more
in

but
have
a
50
chance
of

rule
that
reduce

by
10
create
an
expectation
of
loss
of
million
50
as
a
result
a
financial
hedge
product
may
be
more
appropriate
suppose
the
probability
of
party
x
win
control
of
congress
be
and
the
price
of
the
5000
contract
be
thus
in
that
case
they
would
purchase
60
contract
for
a
total
of
if
the
adverse
event
do
occur
the
firm
would
be
pay
to
compensate
for
their
expect
loss
if
the
adverse
event
do
not
occur
they
would
not
be
pay
but
they
would

the
benefit
of
the

they

that
every
1
percentage

increase
in

rate
increase
their
cost
by
5
million
change
in
regulatory
approval
cost
one
major
contributor
to
the
risk
be
the
probability
that
congress
change
the
law
such
that
ldts
be
treat
the
same
as
all

thereby

the

cm
to
the
food

fda
where
approval
timeline
be
typically
substantially
long
they
estimate
that
change
would
add
an
additional
six
month
to
their
approval
process
which
could
cost
they
roughly
25
million
per
year
change
in
revenue
and
profit
which
could
be
affect
by
change
in
medicare
reimbursement
rate
which
may
affect
the
willingness
of
hospital
to
offer
their
test
they
estimate
that
a
reduction
of
1
in
the
medicare
reimbursement
rate
change
would
cost
they
10
million
per
year
another
factor
relate
to
this
risk
be
change
in
corporate
taxis
include
marginal
rate
which
may
affect
overall
profitability
they
estimate
reverse
the
2017
corporate
tax
reduction
could
cost
their
company
3
million
the
firm
may
determine
that
nsf
nih
funding
remain
a
bipartisan
priority
and
be
unlikely
to
change
regardless
of
the
result
of
the
congressional
election
likewise
the
effect
on
interest
rate
from
congress
may
be
too
attenuated
to
effectively
assess
but
they
determine
that
legislation
to
change
the
regulatory
treatment
of
ldts
be
more
likely
under
one
political
coalition
than
another
since
they
be
a
firm
specialize
in
ldts
this
risk
could
be
quite
severe
as
a
result
they
may
wish
to
purchase
a
financial
product
that
mitigate
their
risk
exposure
the
relationship
between
the
election
and
their
risk
be
sufficiently
direct
that
a
financial
hedge
may
be
valuable
for
instance
suppose
they
believe
that
party
x
win
the
midterm
election
would
result
in
a
16
percentage
point
increase
in
the
probability
that
ldt
reform
legislation
become
law
as
a
result
the
election
of
party
x
create
4
million
in
risk
through
that
channel
alone
25
m
however
party
x
win
also
reduce
the
probability
of
costly
corporate
tax
change
by
33
thereby
reduce
the
expect
loss
by
1
million
as
a
result
they
may
wish
to
purchase
3
million
of
hedging
product
to
zero
out
their
extant
election
risk
which
they
could
do
so
by
purchase
contract
they
may
also
wish
to
only
partially
hedge
by
purchase
less
than
that
critically
even
though
the
election
be
not
deterministic
on
their
bottom
line
it
have
clear
and
unambiguous
effect
on

their

whether
nadex

could
base
the

of

it
be
also
not
the
standard
that
the

ask

kalshi
original

which
use
the

test
as
nadex
to
do
otherwise
and
limit
price
basing
to
only

with
an
underlie

would
be
arbitrary
it
would
also
essentially
invalidate
the
existence
of

basing
or
price

for
the
vast

of

which

this
be

the

the

do
so
implicitly
by
permit
their

for

however
in

the

have
be

for

the

actively
determine

even

the

find
that

perform

purpose
the

apply

there

how

in

the

that

the

without

attempt

alone
successful

any
effort
to

for
the
sake
of

would
take
significant
planning
and
coordination
and
be
unlikely
to
occur
because
none
can
know
beforehand
what
the
margin
of

be
go
to
be
accordingly
the
organizer
would
have
no
way
of
know
the
size
of
the
conspiracy
they
would
need
to
orchestrate
such
an
attempt
would
be
implausible
large
scale
coordination
of
sufficient
volume
to
affect
an
election
of
even
a
few
hundred
thousand
voter
as
exist
in
the

city
would
be

large
to
avoid
scrutiny
from

nearly
every

if
ten

conspire

however
it
be
nearly
impossible
to

ten

without
be

if
this
be
a
viable
path
then
highly

partisan
would
already
attempt
to
do
so
and
profit
from
the
myriad
way
they
could
profit
by
know
the
outcome
of

beforehand
the
reason
this
type
of
criminal
activity
do
not
occur
be
that
such
a
scheme
would
be
readily
detect
one
may
also
imagine
that

may

to

to

thus
potentially
harm
the

this
concern

be
empirically
implausible
coleman

that
