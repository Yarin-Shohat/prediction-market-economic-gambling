we
be
professor
and
academic
researcher
from
a
variety
of
discipline
from
economic
to
political
science
to
law
we
be
write
in
support
of
legalize
the
use
of
prediction
market
for
electoral
outcome
not
just
for
kalshi
but
for
all
other
designate
contract
market
dcm
under
the
supervision
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
we
believe
these
market
be
squarely
in
the
public
interest
and
reject
claim
that
they
constitute
gambling
or
may
threaten
the
integrity
of
our
democratic
process
election
prediction
market
be
a
powerful
resource
for
researcher
researcher
have
be
use
the
datum
generate
by
exist
market
such
as
the
iowa
election
market
iem
and
predictit
for
over
fifteen
year
see
for
example
party
influence
in
congress
and
the
economy
from
erik
snowberg
justin
wolfers
and
eric
zitzewitz
much
of
this
research
fall
into
two
camp
first
some
researcher
use
prediction
market
probability
to
estimate
the
effect
of
the
election
on
various
economic
variable
second
other
researcher
use
prediction
market
probability
to
learn
what
event
actually
influence
campaign
a
legalized
market
with
great
liquidity
and
participation
number
should
allow
these
effort
to
expand
even
far
as
such
these
contract
serve
the
public
interest
the
cftc
solicit
public
comment
on
the
price
base
utility
of
election
contract
in
our
experience
observe
the
market
financial
market
participant
routinely
use
the
probability
of
various
party
control
congress
and
the
presidency
to
accurately
price
various
asset
an
accurate
valuation
of
many
investment
asset
physical
commodity
and
the
value
of
service
require
an
accurate
assessment
of
the
future
trajectory
of
the
political
environment
the
political
environment
have
significant
and
predictable
impact
on
business
and
it
be
a
significant
factor
that
affect
valuation
a
fully
approve
market
without
the
limitation
on
exist
unregulated
market
will
provide
even
well
datum
that
not
only
can
be
use
for
price
financial
asset
physical
commodity
and
service
but
no
doubt
will
furthermore
election
contract
have
bona
fide
hedge
utility
company
already
hedge
electoral
risk
demonstrate
that
this
demand
be
real
and
large
however
these
hedge
be
often
indirect
since
there
be
no
election
base
event
contract
and
their
pricing
be
not
as
accurate
as
an
event
contract
on
the
election
would
be
the
cftc
request
a
number
of
comment
regard
the
likelihood
that
the
contract
will
be
use
by
retail
trader
such
as
individual
family
and
small
business
for
hedging
see
question
8
10
there
may
be
many
assumption
underlie
this
line
of
questioning
include
a
doubt
as
to
whether
election
actually
impact
individual
family
and
small
business
in
a
predictable
way
and
whether
they
be
sophisticated
enough
to
manage
risk
the
answer
be
yes
hedge
be
a
form
of
risk
management
individual
family
and
small
business
all
be
expose
to
myriad
event
that
will
have
economic
impact
if
they
occur
election
make
many
of
these
event
more
or
less
likely
to
occur
that
change
in
likelihood
be
a
direct
change
in
the
risk
exposure
that
these
individual
family
and
small
business
face
that
change
to
risk
be
direct
predictable
and
no
less
real
because
it
be
face
by
a
retail
participant
as
oppose
to
a
big
bank
additionally
the
cftc
should
continue
to
allow
all
participant
include
retail
participant
to
make
their
own
risk
assessment
and
determine
how
good
and
in
what
amount
risk
should
be
manage
the
cftc
also
ask
for
comment
on
whether
exchange
should
have
to
prove
an
exist
market
demand
for
hedging
before
list
a
new
product
as
make
clear
above
there
be
a
demonstrated
market
for
hedge
this
product
and
to
be
clear
this
product
would
pass
the
test
imply
by
question
7
10
however
the
cftc
should
refrain
from
adopt
any
of
the
test
imply
in
these
question
as
they
be
overbroad
and
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
innovation
the
line
of
questioning
be
the
kind
that
be
indicative
of
the
type
of
government
overreach
that
generally
stifle
innovation
if
the
cftc
would
force
an
exchange
to
prove
that
there
be
an
exist
demand
for
hedge
the
cftc
risk
prevent
innovation
and
significantly
stunt
the
growth
and
development
of
event
contract
market
and
other
future
and
derivative
market
additionally
the
cftc
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
market
participant
own
assessment
of
their
risk
and
how
good
to
manage
their
risk
additionally
the
cftc
ask
about
position
limit
the
propose
position
limit
be
correlate
conservatively
to
individual
and
small
business
it
could
be
high
however
that
do
not
impact
whether
the
product
be
likely
to
be
use
for
hedge
indeed
the
low
position
limit
be
important
to
responsible
innovation
to
the
extent
that
there
be
speculative
question
about
the
impact
of
election
market
on
election
integrity
it
make
sense
to
set
position
limit
low
initially
and
gather
datum
if
the
data
demonstrate
that
the
concern
that
the
contract
will
harm
election
integrity
be
unfounded
the
position
limit
can
be
expand
the
cftc
should
encourage
these
type
of
measure
as
they
be
indicative
of
responsible
innovation
a
common
theme
of
the
cftc
question
be
in
regard
to
whether
election
prediction
market
constitute
game
they
do
not
an
election
prediction
market
be
no
more
gaming
than
traditional
financial
market
include
commodity
future
and
derivative
market
due
to
the
vast
economic
utility
of
the
contract
while
it
be
true
that
a
portion
of
market
participant
may
speculate
this
be
fully
consistent
with
normal
market
function
many
participant
in
energy
or
agricultural
market
be
speculator
yet
their
presence
do
not
refute
the
economic
utility
of
those
contract
if
anything
these
speculator
serve
an
important
role
by
provide
liquidity
and
rapid
price
discovery
consider
the
vast
hedging
and
price
basing
value
of
these
contract
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
consider
these
gaming
in
addition
these
market
be
resilient
against
manipulation
in
academic
study
of
manipulation
on
exist
prediction
market
price
pump
attempt
be
short
live
and
the
combination
of
great
liquidity
and
number
of
participant
make
such
a
phenomenon
substantially
less
likely
on
a
well

market

in
addition
the
relatively
low
position
limit
mean
any
one
participant
even
maxe
out
their
total
position
be
highly
unlikely
to
be
able
to
move
the
market
in
a
meaningful
way
for
any
meaningful
period
of
time
as
sophisticated
trader
enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
to
profit
off
of
the
misprice
manipulation
of
the
election
itself
seem
even
less
likely
the
argument
would
be
that
if
someone
now
have
a
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
over
400
election
they
may
either
change
their
own
vote
or
attempt
to
change
the
vote
of
other
this
argument
ignore
the
fact
that
people
already
have
a
significant
amount
at
stake
in
election
additionally
these
fear
be
unfounded
speculation
and
ignore
the
empirical
fact
that
direct
election
trading
exist
in
many
other
country
such
as
the
without
such
document
ill
effect
moreover
the
contract
have
be
design
to
prevent
that
from
happen
by
impose
know
your
customer
authorization
cftc
oversight
and
a
modest
position
limit
change
the
outcome
of
any
election
by
even
an
infinitesimal
amount
let
alone
alter
a
national
election
or
the
totality
of
all
the
congressional
election
would
be
far
more
costly
than
the
propose
position
limit
this
would
be
true
even
with
position
limit
ten
time
large
while
it
be
worth
consider
a
trading
prohibition
on
people
who
have
a
unique
insider
status
member
of
congress
their
chief
of
staff
people
work
in
state
board
of
election
etc
this
objection
should
not
be
ground
for
rejection
of
this
valuable
social
activity
if
these
market
have
any
impact
on
the
electoral
process
at
all
it
would
be
a
positive
impact
polling
error
have
increase
in
recent
year
polarization
be
at
an
all
time
high
fake
news
be
rampant
a
market
base
mechanism
for
forecast
the
outcome
of
the
midterm
would
be
a
vastly
superior
alternative
to
polling
and
punditry
and
would
thus
foster
a
healthy
and
more
reasonable
debate
around
the
electoral
process
combat
fake
news
and
provide
a
well
mechanism
for
truth
make
the
propose
contract
very
much
so
in
the
public
interest
ultimately
these
be
economically
valuable
market
not
game
market
that
promote
the
public
interest
through
superior
forecasting
the
commission
should
embrace
this
valuable
activity
by
bring
it
under
its
regulatory
umbrella
