re
review
of
kalshiex

propose
congressional
control
contract
pursuant
to
commodity
future
trading
commission
regulation
I
a
founder
and
angel
investor
from
the
bay
area
svangel
my
investment
firm
have
have
the
privilege
of
work
with
several
hundred
company
over
the
last
30
year
across
dozen
of
different
industry
these
partner
include
firm
like
google
facebook
coinbase
and
stripe
I
also
an
advocate
for
more
government
action
surround
gun
control
serve
as
vice
chairman
of
ucsf
medical
foundation
and
have
sit
on
the
development
committee
of
institution
like
ucla
packard
child
hospital
and
the
tiger
wood
foundation
which
aim
to
promote
child
health
and
education
I
appreciate
the
cftc
request
the
public
input
into
these
contract
so
that
I
and
other
have
the
opportunity
to
weigh
in
on
their
value
the
cftc
product
underlie
the
global
financial
system
by
provide
risk
management
policy
for
many
different
sector
consequently
I
pay
close
attention
to
the
space
kalshi
contract
would
meet
a
demand
from
the
market
for
both
hedging
and
pricing
purpose
and
provide
an
invaluable
public
service
to
compete
with
polling
and
other
forecast
I
strongly
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
contract
for
list
by
october
28th
in
time
for
the
midterm
election
hedging
and
price
base
economic
utility
kalshi
contract
would
provide
meaningful
risk
mitigation
for
small
business
and
household
in
my
experience
as
an
investor
and
advisor
to
so
many
company
and
small
grow
business
I
see
first
hand
people
struggle
with
these
risk
the
product
propose
by
kalshi
would
go
a
long
way
towards
manage
these
risk
more
specifically
the
cftc
have
solicit
public
comment
regard
whether
the
outcome
of
election
be
predictable
in
order
to
serve
as
effective
hedging
tool
they
be
the
evidence
be
extensive
and
hard
to
ignore
this
be
not
a
secret
investment
bank
hire
whole
division
to
estimate
the
impact
election
will
have
on
their
client
this
data
be
also
publish
publicly
on
occasion
or
discuss
by
the
financial
press
slate
wall
street
say
you
should
short
mexico
to
prepare
for
trump
while
some
headline
refer
to
presidential
outcome
plenty
detail
very
specific
congressional
outcome
like
when
in
2020
bank
of
america
provide
roadmap
for
each
type
of
partisan
outcome
one
party
control
all
of
government
divide
government
et
cetera
there
they
write
that
full
democratic
control
of
government
would
lead
to
2
trillion
in
stimulus
compare
to
a
biden
win
with
a
divided
congress
1
trillion
or
a
trump
win
with
a
divided
congress
2
trillion
they
also
detail
impact
to
specific
sector
like
business
expose
to
chinese
trade
in
each
scenario
academic
consistently
discuss
the
link
between
change
in
partisan
control
of
congress
and
change
in
polling
with
consistent
effect
on
financial
market
suggest
significant
hedging
and
reprice
by
the
market
to
manage
risk
arise
from
upcoming
shift
in
control
of
congress
ceo
also
frequently
flag
electoral
risk
as
it
relate
to
their
bottom
line
in
earning
call
accord
to
factset
more
than
a
third
of
earning
call
in
q3
2020
mention
the
word
election
I
encourage
commissioner
and
staff
to
see
these
discussion
concern
about
a
particular
congressional
outcome
be
particularly
relevant
for
energy
health
care
and
financial
firm
comment
by
several
business
and
individual
have
also
testify
to
the
importance
of
hedge
election
in
their
life
and
business
if
the
market
be
engage
in
significant
extant
hedging
activity
then
it
be
not
deniable
that
an
election
event
contract
contain
significant
hedging
utility
and
it
be
reasonably
likely
that
the
contract
will
be
use
for
hedge
the
hedge
use
of
this
contract
be
so
obvious
that
it
would
satisfy
even
the
cftc
propose
test
of
market
demand
exist
I
also
note
that
concern
along
the
line
of
whether
elect
official
actually
successfully
implement
their
goal
and
policy
be
incorrect
as
discuss
above
market
and
business
react
to
risk
of
political
control
so
clearly
political
control
risk
have
impact
and
these
risk
can
be
manage
far
this
be
not
different
from
many
other
exist
cftc
product
basis
risk
be
normal
in
many
derivative
product
like
hurricane
or
housing
price
index
future
there
no
guarantee
that
a
drop
in
the
case
shiller
housing
price
index
whose
future
be
list
on
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
will
actually
reduce
asset
value
or
cash
flow
for
an
investor
or
homeowner
nonetheless
the
cftc
permit
these
valuable
market
innovation
to
be
list
I
also
note
that
a
commenter
say
I
could
not
or
would
not
use
this
contract
to
hedge
should
have
little
consequence
there
be
certainly
no
requirement
that
everyone
be
able
to
use
the
contract
to
hedge
only
that
it
can
reasonably
be
use
for
hedge
all
of
the
comment
demonstrate
how
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
directly
address
the
question
and
demonstrate
that
the
contract
can
and
will
be
use
for
hedge
question
seven
ask
whether
the
risk
that
election
portend
can
be
hedge
use
other
product
I
be
not
aware
of
another
circumstance
where
this
logic
be
use
to
potentially
deny
a
product
with
legitimate
hedge
purpose
though
I
can
imagine
many
such
instance
such
as
hedge
the
risk
of
government
benefit
be
take
away
the
contract
itself
would
still
be
valuable
to
isolate
risk
rather
than
be
subject
to
the
risk
of
other
asset
and
produce
significant
price
basing
benefit
uniquely
public
interest
in
addition
to
further
the
public
interest
by
introduce
an
important
hedging
tool
the
market
will
further
the
public
interest
by
provide
an
important
datum
point
that
will
help
researcher
and
policy
maker
predictit
have
be
cite
by
many
prominent

and
government
official
its

finally
the
cftc
ask
if
this
situation
be
any
different
than
in
2012
when
it
previously
rule
on
similar
contract
event
contract
be
extremely
limited
in
practice
in
2012
in
2008
when
it
seek
public
comment
on
event
contract
regulation
the
commission
acknowledge
its
extremely
limited
experience
with
event
contract
in
fact
it
admit
its
only
experience
be
with
iowa
electronic
market
for
which
it
have
give
two
no
action
letter
in
the
1990
between
then
and
the
nadex
order
the
only
event
contract
that
be
certify
with
the
commission
be
a
small
number
of
economic
indicator
from
nadex
itself
and
motion
picture
box
office
contract
which
be
swiftly
ban
by
congress
that
be
say
the
concept
of
election
event
contract
be
so
natural
to
the
commission
such
that
even
at
that
time
the
commission
use
the
example
of
a
presidential
election
binary
to
explain
event
contract
to
the
public
federal
register
concept
release
on
the
appropriate
regulatory
treatment
of
event
contract
event
contract
be
so
limited
in
2012
that
regulation
which
be
the
justification
for
reject
nadex
contract
be
only
publish
the
day
before
the
nadex
order
kalshi
proposal
provide
a
prime
opportunity
for
the
commission
to
make
a
decision
more
in
line
with
the
public
interest
and
law
innovation
the
fact
that
these
contract
be
innovative
be
not
a
reason
to
prohibit
the
contract
many
innovative
product
have
become
staple
of
the
market
and
have
encourage
significant
economic
growth
in
the
past
for
example
basic
agricultural
future
and
index
settle
product
be
once
consider
to
be
devoid
of
hedge
utility
and
be
pure
gaming
product
today
those
product
be
cornerstone
of
the
global
financial
system
it
be
critical
for
government
agency
to
rely
on
evidence
and
testimony
from
potential
hedger
and
other
rather
than
speculation
or
knee
jerk
skepticism
to
novel
product
like
kalshi
this
mean
consider
their
testimony
look
at
the
experience
of
other
nation
and
the
large
value
that
election
market
have
have
for
academic
and
the
public
as
discuss
above
kalshi
contract
submission
do
already
have
significant
market
hedging
activity
however
I
concern
that
it
could
stifle
innovation
to
require
this
of
proposal
especially
as
outline
in
question
eight
and
nine
question
eight
specifically
request
whether
the
commission
should
consider
require
applicant
to
provide
demonstrate
need
of
hedging
and
then
ask
if
some
percent
of
market
participant
must
be
legitimately
hedge
both
of
these
standard
would
be
very
damaging
towards
responsible
innovator
a
demonstrate
need
standard
could
make
it
more
difficult
for
participant
to
bring
product
to
market
that
potentially
disrupt
and
compete
with
exist
product
or
which
serve
a
niche
that
have
yet
to
but
will
be
fill
in
addition
there
be
no
way
for
a
registrant
to
prove
in
advance
of
list
nor
do
there
exist
a
mechanism
by
which
the
commission
could
reasonably
guess
what
percent
of
its
participant
would
be
hedge
as
oppose
to
speculate
it
seem
perverse
to
prevent
would
be
hedger
from
use
a
product
that
would
benefit
they
on
the
basis
that
too
many
other
would
use
it
for
speculation
it
would
be
disappointing
to
see
these
novel
standard
apply
to
kalshi
contract
as
precedent
for
future
submission
question
nine
then
go
on
to
ask
whether
and
how
the
commission
should
consider
the
contract
availability
towards
retail
investor
should
affect
their
analysis
the
commission
should
not
punish
the
contract
for
be
more
accessible
not
less
to
investor
although
retail
investor
be
small
they
be
affect
just
as
much
by
macro
political
level
event
as
large
business
retail
investor
can
hedge
all
the
same
and
be
no
more
likely
to
engage
in
speculation
as
large
dollar
institution
many
of
whom
specialize
in
such
behavior
kalshi
contract
be
a
potentially
powerful
tool
for
the
market
I
look
forward
to
the
commission
decision
