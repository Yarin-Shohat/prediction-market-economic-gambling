re

propose

contract
commissioner
we
sincerely
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
submission
by
kalshiex
llc
of
its
propose
congressional
control
contract
for
commission
review
and
approval
the
question
of
election
event
contract
raise
important
issue
of
both
law
and
public
policy
and
we
commend
the
commission
for
recognize
their
importance
and
seek
public
input
we
submit
this
comment
on
behalf
of
an
anonymous
client
with
a
deep
interest
in
the
lawfulness
of
election
event
contract
we
believe
the
commission
have
a
sound
basis
in
law
and
policy
for
approve
kalshi
propose
contract
as
to
the
law
we
believe
that
election
event
contract
like
kalshi
do
not
involve
game
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
or
rule
of
the
commission
regulation
and
so
be
not
proscribe
by
those
provision
in
addition
we
believe
that
rule
properly
understand
in
light
of
the
cea
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
apa
afford
the
commission
discretion
to
approve
election
event
contract
even
if
those
contract
do
involve
game
finally
as
to
policy
we
believe
election
event
contract
promote
the
public
good
by
among
other
thing
enhance
the
accuracy
of
political
prediction
promote
new
form
of
democratic
participation
and
serve
as
an
economic
hedge
for
both
firm
and
individual
we
thus
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
propose
contract
section
and
rule
do
not
apply
to
election
event
contract
under
the
cea
the
commission
must
approve
contract
submit
to
it
unless
the
commission
affirmatively
find
that
they
violate
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulation

the
commission
have
express
concern
that
election
event
contract
may
conflict
with
section
of
the
act
and
rule
which
together
prohibit

an

prohibit
activity
nor
a
similar
activity
determine
by
the
commission

thus
kalshi

these

supply

such
an
