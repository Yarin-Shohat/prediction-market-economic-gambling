so
the

that
be
both
unnecessary
and
an
overreach
of
its
statutory

as
discuss

unambiguously
create

three
step

for

our
point

process
set

do
not
require

we
urge
you

and
to

altogether
we
appreciate
the

north

1
the
cftc
be
require
to
follow
the
cea
three
step
approach
to
evaluate
event
contract
cea
section
establish
a
three
step
inquiry
first
the
cftc
must
determine
that
the
contract
be
list
by
the
relevant
dcm
or
swap
execution
facility
sef
be
in
an
exclude
commodity
and
be
base
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
this
first
step
be
barely
address
in
the
event
contract
nopr
and
deserve
emphasis
it
be
unequivocal
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
the
cftc
can
not
use
its
authority
under
section
to
prohibit
certain
type
of
event
contract
where
the
contract
in
question
involve
an
exempt
or
agricultural
commodity
for
this
reason
we
believe
that
the
cftc
must
articulate
its
justification
for
determine
that
a
give
contract
have
an
underlie
exclude
commodity
this
should
not
be
a
foregone
conclusion
as
an
example
if
the
cftc
believe
that
an
event
contract
base
on
the
outcome
of
a
senate
race
involve
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
under
cea
section
the
cftc
must
also
articulate
how
that
contract
be
associate
with
a
financial
commercial
or
economic
consequence
to
be
clear
cdna
express
no
view
as
to
whether
any
such
political
event
contract
be
base
on
an
underlie
exclude
commodity
but
urge
the
cftc
to
transparently
justify
its
conclusion
on
this
point
to
ensure
that
it
be
comply
with
its
statutorily
mandate
review
process
second
the
cftc
must
examine
whether
an
event
contract
in
a
specify
exclude
commodity
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
the
enumerate
activity
under
the
cea
be
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
other
similar
activity
determine
by
the
cftc
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
once
the
cftc
determine
that
the
contract
involve
such
activity
the
commission
must
assess
whether
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
under
the
event
contract
nopr
the
cftc
would
categorically
conclude
that
any
event
contract
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
thereby
eliminate
one
step
in
the
three
step
inquiry
that
be
require
under
the
cea
the
commission
be
correct
that
it
have
statutory
authority
to
make
this
public
interest
determination
but
it
be
incorrect
that
it
can
do
so
categorically
for
entire
class
of
event
contract
if
congress
have
want
to
prohibit
entire
swath
of
event
contract
base
on
the
enumerate
activity
without
any
further
analysis
then
it
could
have
do
so
congress
have
the
ability
to
draft
much
more
simply
the
follow
type
of
event
contract
be
prohibit
but
it
do
not
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute
suggest
that
the
cftc
be
require
to
undergo
some
review
of
each
individual
contract
that
fit
within
the
realm
of
cea
section
and
in
fact
this
section
of
the
cea
be
title
special
rule
for
review
and
approval
of
event
contract
and
swap
contract
we
urge
the
cftc
not
to
sidestep
its
obligation
to
undergo
a
three
step
review
process
with
respect
to
these
type
of
event
contract
and
to
eliminate
this
aspect
of
the
event
contract
nopr
2
the
exist
product
certification
process
serve
as
an
effective
control
on
list
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
believe
that
the
cftc
process
for
certification
of
list
product
for
trading
and
clearing
be
sufficient
to
protect
the
public
interest
cftc
regulation
and
establish
the
rule
a
dcm
swap
execution
facility
sef
or
dco
must
follow
to
list
a
product
for
trading
or
clear
on
its
platform
to
list
a
new
contract
a
dcm
sef
or
dco
must
provide
the
cftc
with
a
concise
explanation
and
analysis
of
the
product
and
its
compliance
with
applicable
provision
of
the
cea
include
core
principle
and
the
commission
regulation
thereunder
cftc
regulation
as
self
regulatory
organization
dcms
be
well
equipped
to
promulgate
and
enforce
rule
that
limit
the
risk
contemplate
by
the
event
contract
nopr
as
the
event
contract
nopr
note
nadex
have
a
long
history
of
list
event
contract
that
conform
to
the
cea
and
cftc
regulation
as
they
exist
the
same
listing
standard
that
have
support
a
healthy
event
contract
market
for
15
year
apply
to
establish
and
emerge
exchange
alike
even
those
that
be
interested
in
list
novel
event
contract
3
the
cftc
should
seek
clarity
from
congress
regard
cea
section
as
note
in
the
event
contract
nopr
there
be
no
section
in
the
cea
despite
the
fact
that
this
section
be
reference
in
cea
section
the
cftc
can
speculate
about
congress
intend
meaning
but
it
should
not
it
be
for
congress
to
decide
what
the
correct
reference
be
intend
to
be
it
seem
quite
possible
that
this
be
a
drafting
error
when
the
statute
be
amend
and
congress
be
the
appropriate
body
to
clarify
this
point
and
identify
the
correct
reference
in
cea
section
not
the
cftc
cdna
be
supportive
of
well
craft
effective
regulation
of
derivative
market
and
support
the
cftc
goal
to
ensure
that
event
contract
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
be
within
the
public
interest
the
cftc
can
accomplish
this
through
a
principle
base
approach
and
without
modify
cftc
regulation
or
its
interpretation
of
cea
section
unless
direct
to
do
so
by
congress
we
welcome
the
opportunity
to
discuss
our
comment
in
further
detail
sincerely
