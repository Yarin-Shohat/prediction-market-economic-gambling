dear
chairman
and
commissioner
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
I
be
a
retired
union
stagehand
who
consistently
lose
money
in
the
stock
market
I
have
to
give
up
sport
bet
because
I
consistently
lose
at
that
too
both
of
those
attempt
to
supplement
my
small
fix
retirement
income
wind
up
be
drain
on
my
income
and
my
family
and
then
I
discover
prediction
market
I
find
that
my
knowledge
of
politic
and
probability
be
actual
asset
that
I
could
use
to
make
money
I
find
that
my
critical
thinking
skill
and
the
ability
to
learn
quickly
be
even
more
valuable
than
I
have
ever
dream
I
find
that
when
I
be
able
to
keep
my
bias
in
check
I
could
profit
from
those
who
could
not
I
find
that
when
I
do
understand
something
I
could
learn
about
it
and
be
reward
for
that
learning
unlike
sport
bet
casino
gambling
or
even
invest
in
the
stock
market
I
feel
as
if
I
be
provide
a
public
service
by
predict
election
outcome
and
polling
average
even
climate
change
and
economic
indicator
prediction
market
have
be
prove
to
aggregate
large
swath
of
datum
and
make
accurate
prediction
that
be
much
more
useful
to
the
economy
and
the
world
than
predict
who
will
for
example
win
the
super
bowl
I
be
a
superforecaster
at
the
good
judgement
project
where
our
prediction
regularly
wind
up
on
the
desk
of
the
president
senator
and
many
other
member
of
the
us
government
who
find
our
prediction
to
be
a
valuable
tool
I
be
a
forecaster
at
intrade
where
we
accurately
predict
several
election
and
even
manage
to
keep
prediction
accurate
when
million
of
dollar
be
come
in
on
what
would
prove
to
be
the
lose
side
those
market
work
well
despite
the
attempt
by
some
very
wealthy
people
to
paint
a
narrative
by
manipulate
those
market
those
of
we
who
see
that
one
side
be
attempt
to
influence
price
to
influence
the
medium
narrative
and
thereby
the
election
outcome
know
exactly
what
be
happen
and
profit
from
it
we
be
the
poster
child
of
efficient
market
theory
I
have
be
predict
election
and
polling
average
at
predictit
since
its
founding
and
have
become
an
expert
on
make
those
market
more
efficient
use
link
margin
in
what
kalshi
refer
to
as
mutually
exclusive
group
I
appear
on
multiple
podcast
to
help
people
understand
these
method
of
create
liquidity
and
efficiency
in
these
market
my
year
of
work
in
this
area
have
prove
quite
profitable
and
help
I
in
retirement
by
provide
regular
income
for
my
effort
I
work
with
a
team
of
people
who
have
all
become
amazingly
good
at
what
we
do
the
efficiency
and
accuracy
of
the
market
at
predicit
be
a
testament
to
the
good
work
we
and
many
other
have
do
and
it
a
shame
that
all
that
hard
work
could
be
meaningless
now
in
a
world
where
anyone
with
a
phone
can
bet
on
a
football
game
but
those
of
we
who
actually
invest
in
future
that
help
scientist
economist
and
politician
create
a
well
world
more
accurately
base
on
fact
and
imply
probability
will
be
leave
with
no
place
to
use
our
talent
and
skill
since
kalshi
have
move
into
the
prediction
market
arena
I
discover
that
I
can
use
their
site
to
hedge
economic
risk
to
I
such
as
inflation
interest
rate
and
even
recession
even
well
I
discover
that
the
large
institution
to
whom
I
likely
lose
money
when
I
be
invest
in
stock
and
bond
be
hedge
on
these
economic
indicator
like
inflation
and
they
often
distort
price
away
from
what
be
the
likely
reality
offer
I
excellent
expect
value
that
have
prove
quite
profitable
the
same
reasoning
behind
have
prediction
market
that
allow
wall
street
to
hedge
against
risk
in
economic
indicator
such
as
inflation
gdp
and
interest
rate
apply
even
more
to
election
because
much
of
what
happen
economically
be
directly
relate
to
political
power
prediction
market
on
who
will
have
that
power
provide
two
extremely
beneficial
effect
hedge
against
the
risk
of
political
change
and
accurately
predict
future
event
that
have
an
outsized
impact
on
economic
I
especially
interested
in
predict
climate
change
something
with
the
potential
to
greatly
upset
economic
market
all
over
the
world
I
would
relish
the
chance
to
invest
in
more
market
that
predict
the
long
term
impact
of
climate
change
from
polar
ice
cap
melt
to
global
temperature
from
sea
level
rise
to
freshwater
reservoir
demise
by
invest
in
a
future
where
climate
change
impact
be
much
bad
than
they
be
now
I
can
create
wealth
to
help
my
family
deal
with
those
impact
and
since
what
we
americans
do
about
climate
change
be
highly
dependent
on
electoral
outcome
I
would
relish
the
ability
to
minimize
the
risk
my
family
might
face
in
this
climate
emergency
future
by
invest
in
the
political
future
I
see
come
in
the
more
immediate
political
future
the
hedge
benefit
be
obvious
since
I
no
long
employ
through
my
union
my
wife
no
long
have
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seem
that
republicans
be
likely
to
take
control
I
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premium
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
small
or
that
her
ability
to
purchase
insurance
at
all
be
take
away
completely
but
even
in
market
where
I
be
not
hedge
risk
I
be
still
provide
a
valuable
service
by
make
the
market
more
liquid
and
more
predictive
I
learn
valuable
skill
in
market
making
and
liquidity
provide
that
provide
I
with
a
regular
income
while
I
make
the
market
more
efficient
and
predictive
in
many
case
especially
with
link
market
or
mutually
exclusive
group
as
I
mention
above
I
be
able
to
make
money
with
little
or
even
no
risk
to
myself
these
kind
of
arbitrage
opportunity
just
be
realistically
possible
for
small
investor
in
big
market
like
the
stock
market
and
they
do
exist
at
all
in
the
gaming
world
of
sport
and
casino
gambling
I
hope
for
all
our
sake
and
especially
for
the
sake
of
my
granddaughter
that
the
cftc
embrace
this
innovative
and
beneficial
possibility
for
kalshi
to
provide
election
market
so
that
we
can
live
in
a
world
where
fact
logic
and
reason
be
still
valuable
commodity
that
one
can
use
to
create
value
thank
you
