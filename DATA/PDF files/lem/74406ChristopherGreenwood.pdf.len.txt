this
comment
be
on
behalf
of
temper
one
of
america
lead
health
and
nutrition
startup
specifically
temper
sell
a
novel
cannabinoid
mint
for
diet
management
election
contract
would
allow
temper
to
reduce
its
risk
exposure
to
federal
election
and
would
thus
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
event
contract
space
as
a
company
that
sell
a
product
that
involve
cannabinoid
federal
policy
be
a
key
determinant
of
our
success
the
lack
of
clarity
at
a
federal
level
for
hemp
and
cannabinoid
have
make
secure
finance
customer
corporate
partnership
and
advertising
more
difficult
than
it
otherwise
would
be
large
financier
such
as
pension
fund
and
sovereign
wealth
fund
be
reluctant
to
invest
money
in
a
company
that
could
face
crackdown
in
the
face
of
a
hostile
new
government
without
regulatory
clarity
take
the
next
step
to
become
an
even
large
company
be
difficult
however
it
be
abundantly
clear
the
difference
between
the
two
party
on
cannabis
policy
the
democratic
party
be
far
more
sympathetic
to
complete
legalization
and
hostile
to
enforcement
effort
in
contrast
the
republican
party
be
much
more
critical
the
odd
of
complete
legalization
and
regulatory
clarity
substantially
fall
if
the
republican
party
gain
control
of
at
least
one
house
of
congress
notably
the
harm
manifest
to
a
company
like
ours
even
before
any
policy
action
be
take
as
financier
and
corporate
partner
may
be
skittish
in
anticipation
of
potential
action
as
a
result
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
be
more
than
sufficiently
predictable
for
we
to
use
the
product
for
its
hedge
purpose
in
addition
as
we
plan
to
take
the
next
step
in
our
business
the
probability
generate
by
the
contract
price
could
be
powerful
input
who
be
in
power
come
january
2023
might
affect
our
expansion
plan
our
growth
strategy
and
beyond
have
a
market
drive
datum
point
that
update
rapidly
and
be
not
subject
to
ideological
bias
could
be
helpful
in
facilitate
the
good
decision
making
process
possible
for
thousand
of
company
include
our
own
congressional
control
be
no
game
it
be
a
real
threat
to
our
business
bottom
line
the
same
way
a
public
health
emergency
or
a
natural
disaster
or
an
economic
downturn
might
be
a
threat
to
other
business
we
should
be
able
to
access
the
same
tool
to
manage
those
risk
as
we
can
manage
those
other
dismiss
this
valuable
product
on
the
ground
that
it
could
be
use
for
gaming
or
can
not
be
use
for
hedging
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
experience
of
our
company
and
many
other
we
would
suggest
kindly
that
the
commission
allow
the
contract
to
move
forward
