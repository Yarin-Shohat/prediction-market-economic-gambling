should

consider
whether
similar
offering
be

venue
such
as

whether
take

should
the

be
available
in

venue
such
as
casino
or

no
the
commission
should
not
consider
this
in
determine
whether
a
contract
be
gaming
and
subject
to
the
special
rule
for
event
contract
for
four
reason
1
presence
on
an
illegal
exchange
casino
or
sportsbook
do
not
by
right
cause
relation
to
gaming
for
example
if
corn
future
become
widely
trade
in
casino
and
sport
book
that
would
not
change
the
nature
of
the
corn
future
contract
into
a
gaming
contract
the
converse
be
also
true
if
a
traditional
future
exchange
start
a
roulette
parlor
the
bet
in
the
parlor
would
still
be
game
2
what
be
offer
at
such
venue
change
over
time
for
example
if
we
use
this
nature
of
the
venue
determine
nature
of
the
product
standard
many
commodity
future
and
security
might
have
originally
be
consider
game
because
bucket
shop
trade
those
product
in
large
volume
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
century
they
may
have
continue
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
bucket
shop
prohibition
3
the
commission
prevent
congressional
control
contract
from
be
list
on
exchange
in
the
nadex
order
it
would
be
circular
to
use
the
fact
that
such
activity
have
persist
off
exchange
as
evidence
the
activity
be
game
for
example
if
the
commission
prohibit
oil
future
and
oil
future
trading
move
to
casino
that
would
not
suddenly
change
the
economic
nature
of
oil
future
4
the
commission
do
not
consider
the
venue
offer
for
example
bitcoin
contract
prior
to
the
listing
of
bitcoin
contract
on
dcms
if
the
commission
consider
this
inquiry
to
be
dispositive
that
something
be
game
those
contract
would
be
game
contract
because
of
their
large
presence
on
such
venue
however
even
if
the
commission
do
consider
venue
as
relevant
in
determine
whether
the
contract
involve
game
congressional
control
be
not
offer
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
and
be
not
available
in
casino

currently
offer
on
some
overseas
bet
service
and
illegal
or
unregulated
venue
in
the
united

instead
of
consider
venue
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
subject
of
the
contract
involve
gaming
when
adjudicate
whether
a
contract

per
the

ibid
it
could
not
follow
more
plainly
that
cftc
regulate
derivative
have
the
same
preemptive
effect
congress
have
repeatedly
recognize
that
future
and
other
derivative
contract
serve
economic
purpose
and
therefore
state
law
that
purport
to
prohibit
or
regulate
future
or
derivative
contract
include
gaming
law
do
not
violate
the
cea
and
be

all
of

show
that
congress
and
the

understand
that
there
be
a
critical
distinction
between
bet
and
legitimate
financial
activity
election
contract
that
be
design
for
hedge
on
a
financial
market
constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
consider
the
contract
as
involve
unlawful
activity
as
these
law
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to
contract
like
kalshi
a
key
purpose
of
the
cea
and
grant
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over

be
to
authorize
and
promote
trading
of
future
contract
notwithstanding
state
law
that
might
purport
to
prohibit
they
as
gamble
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
be
relevant
be
if
the
activity
underlie
the
event
contract
violate
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evastion
in
that
case
congress
want
to
make
sure
that
a
future
contract
would
not
legitimize
that
activity
without
the
commission
consider
whether
trade
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
obviously
would
not
be
concern
about
legitimize
election
even
if
the
focus
come
to
legitimize
the
trading
on
election
as
part
of
the
ultimate
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
have
already
cross
that
bridge
by
long
permit
market
participant
to
trade
such
contract
pursuant
to
no

letter
award
to
unregulated
market
the
notion
that
allow
a
regulated

to
offer
the
contract
be
what
change
the
public
interest
analysis
be
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
bet
the
wire
act
be
irrelevant
here
it
apply
only
to
sport
bet
and
wager
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
address
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the
internet
it
carve
out
derivative
contract
both
on
exchange
and
over
the
counter
from
the
definition
of
bet
and
wager
thereby
plainly
recognize
that

serve
economic

that

from

in
the
more
immediate
political
future
the
hedge
benefit
be
obvious
since
I
no
long
employ
through
my
union
my
wife
no
long
have
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seem
that
republicans
be
likely
to
take
control
I
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premium
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
small
or
that
her
ability
to
purchase
insurance
at
all
be
take

early

there

there

a

the

will
decline
in

that

public
comment
by
christopher
hehmeyer
available
at
although
some
commenter
claim
election
outcome
be
predictable
enough
to
be
a
useful
hedge
that
in
no
way
contradict
or
even
diminish
those
who
say
the
opposite
at
most
those
commenter
do
see
hedge
utility
for
themselves
but
they
can
not
credibly
say
especially
give
the
comment
file
that
all
the
people
who
identify
how
they
would
use
the
contract
for
hedge
and
manage
their
risk
be
mistaken
or
deficient
in
their
ability
to
recognize
risk
and
potential
tool
to
manage
or
mitigate
that
risk
it
would
be
arbitrary
for
the
commission
to
listen
only
to
those
who
assert
that
there
be
no
hedge
use
case
for
anyone
when
there
be
many
other
who
state
that
they
would
use
the
product
for
themselves
or
their
business
as
note
by
hehmeyer
there
be
sufficient
impact
from
election
themselves
independent
of
the
policy
implication
of
political
control
to
not
only
justify
these
market
economic
utility
but
to
make
they
valuable
in
addition
market
already
believe
that
the
policy
implication
of
election
themselves
be
sufficiently
meaningful
so
as
to
be
worth
reprice
asset
suggest
that
they
be
predictable
enough
election
have
vast
consequence
which
directly
impact
the
likelihood
of
event
happen
or
not
happen
such
as
a
bill
be
pass
while
it
be
true
that
there
be
some
uncertainty
about
the
precise
implementation
of
any
give
law
by
a
new
congress
what
exactly
would
the
size
of
the
stimulus
check
be
what
exactly
would
the
new
tax
rate
be
change
in
probability
be
more
than
sufficient
for
hedge
purpose
in
addition
once
the
specific
of
a
policy
risk
have
be
announce
like
the
text
of
a
bill
it
practically
impossible
to
hedge
because
of
the
high
cost
now
that
the
probability
of
the
event
have
increase
it
important
for
a
potential
hedger
to
hedge
in
advance
of
the
specific
of
their
risk
be
announce
change
in
general
risk
also
can
provide
a
strong
hedging
need
as
oppose
to
the
change
in
risk
of
a
specific
outcome
if
one
party
be
in
complete
control
of
congress
there
be
likely
to
be
a
change
in
general
risk
on
carbon
base
energy
product
and
industry
and
an
opposite
change
in
general
risk
on
renewable
energy
product
and
industry
while
the
specific
policy
implement
may
be
hard
to
know
in
advance
that
change
in
general
risk
have
be
discuss
at
length

public
comment
by
angelo

consider
a
concrete
example
of
probabilistic
change
from
the
bond
market
ten
percent
of
the
catastrophe
bond
market
be
in
parametric
trigger
which
mean
the
bond
pay
out
if
certain
meteorological
trigger
be
meet
the
bond
issuer
do
not
know
for
certain
whether
the
storm
that
meet
the
threshold
will
cause
mass
flooding
power
outage
and
property
damage
and
conversely
it
possible
that
such
damage
could
occur
with
a
storm
that
do
not
meet
the
trigger
threshold
yet
they
use
the
bond
to
hedge
nonetheless
because
other
feature
of
the
bond
hedge
wind
speed
namely
be
more
important
to
they
than
eliminate
basis
risk
moreover
even
if
a
wheat
farmer
buy
a
contract
that
pay
out
if
the
price
of
wheat
fall
below
a
certain
threshold
there
be
still
some
uncertainty
as
to
whether
that
event
will
harm
they
it
possible
that
a
wheat
fall
below
a
certain
threshold
because
weather
condition
be
so
great
that
there
be
a
bumper
crop
and
that
the
increase
in
their
supply
offset
the
loss
in
price
or
b
that
the
national
price
do
not
perfectly
correlate
with
the
local
price
they
receive
but
they
can
use
the
product
nevertheless
7
be

unique
economic

tie
to
the
outcome
of

that
can
not
be
hedge
via
derivative
product
on
equity
debt
interest
rate
tax
rate
asset
value
and
other

price
the
commission
question
can
be
take
to
imply
two
different
thing
either
that
the
other
product
be
link
directly
on
the
same
risk
that
the
contract
would
be
use
for
hedging
or
that
market
participant
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedge
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instrument
assume
the
former
the
answer
be
yes
there
be
risk
that
can
not
be
currently
hedge
first
as
note
by
hehmeyer
and
other
commenter
and
in
the
exchange
submission
there
be
significant
direct
non
policy
relate
economic
risk
such
as
the
risk
impose
by
political
outcome
on
the
fortune
of
medium
personality
medium
consultant
and
other
with
connection
and
tie
to
the
party
in
power
these
risk
can
not
be
otherwise
hedge
by
traditional
product
as
discuss
in
the
response
to
question
six
change
in
general
risk
that
a
certain
congress
could
pose
to
various
industry
can
be
discern
well
in
advance
of
knowledge
of
the
particular
policy
that
may
be
implement
by
that
congress
and
provide
just
as
valid
a
hedge
rationale
this
difference
result
from
the
time
horizon
between
the
election
cycle
and
the
implementation
of
a
new
congress
specific
legislative
agenda
or
its
potential
response
to
current
event
for
example
follow
the
election
of
republicans
into
congress
in
2016
many
publication
speculate
that
trade
policy
would
become
more
restrictive
however
it
be
not
know
if
this
would
come
in
the
form
of
new
trade
deal
re
negotiate
exist
trade
agreement
new
tarrif
and
if
so
on
what
good
and
at
what
level
international
lawsuit
and
more
another
event
contract
or
future
on
taxis
or
public
policy
would
not
have
be
very
helpful
however
the
risk
of
a
more
restrictive
policy
be
there
because
of
who
would
win
the
election
exactly
what
kalshi
contract
allow
trader
to
hedge
another
example
be
new
legislation
that
would
burden
a
market
participant
once
the
legislation
draft
be
release
the
impact
will
begin
to
be
feel
immediately
on
asset
cash
flow
and
partnership
as
market
participant
price
in
risk
make
a
hedge
useless
the
downside
risk
have
already
have
much
of
its
effect
market
be
forward
look
and
hedge
product
should
reflect
that
even
just
a
statement
by

additionally
a
single
market
participant
may
face
myriad
risk
from
election
many
firm
and
individual
be
negatively
affect
by
a
suite
of
a
party
policy
and
thus
wish
to
hedge
the
many
different
change
in
risk
through
a
single
contract
for
example
an
oil
company
may
wish
to
hedge
the
risk
that
a
new
democratic
government
will
come
into
office
because
that
government
could
not
only
impose
new
regulation
on
they
but
also
change
the
composition
of
exist
regulatory
body
and
increase
their
labor
cost
through
raise
the
minimum
wage
support
unionization
or
mandate
great
health
care
benefit
for
employee
only
kalshi
proposal
let
they
hedge
the
risk
they
actually
face
democratic
government
if
the
question
be
ask
instead
whether
market
participant
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedge
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instrument
the
answer
be
they
can
not
many
retail
and
small
business
market
participant
do
not
have
access
to
these
other
instrument
and
the
inherent
friction
and
transaction
cost
in
arrange
these
type
of
complex
proxy
play
be
prohibitive
it
seem
unlikely
that
the
commission
would
determine
it
in
the
public
interest
to
solely
rely
on
these
tool
that
be
inaccessible
to
many
of
the
market
participant
who
need
risk
management
tool
most
additionally
the
effectiveness
of
these
basket
and
combination
of
instrument
to
hedge
the
risk
from
political
control
be
considerably
less
than
a
contract
directly
on
political
control
importantly
the
question
imply
that
its
answer
matter
but
do
not
explain
why
it
would
a
reasonable
inference
be
that
the
commission
be
say
no
new
method
of
hedge
a
risk
should
be
permit
if
there
be
other
exist
method
of
hedge
that
risk
nowhere
in
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulation
be
there
such
a
standard
the
exchange
hop
this
be
not
the
commission
view
as
it
have
not
be
the
exchange
experience
when
engage
with
the
commission
on
prior
contract
for
example
should
the
commission
say
farmer
can
buy
crop
insurance
therefore
they
should
not
have
access
to
agricultural
future
product
furthermore
such
an
interpretation
would
be
highly
anti
competitive
such
an
interpretation
would
mean
that
if
one
firm
offer
a
contract
on
an
event
or
a
commodity
that
no
challenger
should
enter
the
market
with
a
similar
but
different
product
to
compete
with
it
in
fact
such
an
interpretation
would
consistently
punish
novel
or
innovative
product
in
many
case
it
be
possible
to
construct
a
hedge
use
exist
product
and
attempt
to
do
so
might
be
expensive
or
incur
excess
basis
risk
the
fact
that
election
risk
have
implication
for
other
asset
be
in
fact
much
of
the
justification
for
the
contract
hedge
utility
and
would
work
in
concert
with
such
asset
many
similar
and
compete
product
be
list
by
different
exchange
in
order
to
promote
a
vibrant
and
competitive
marketplace
for
hedger
this
be
also
an
important
component
of
the
contract
price
discovery
utility
discuss
in
a
later
question
such
an
interpretation
would
also
curtail
innovation
innovation
often
happen
through
iterate
on
already
successful
product
and
idea
as
in
the
early
example
the
existence
of
insurance
product
would
have
inhibit
the
creation
of
future
innovation
often
require
create
new
and
sometimes
flawed
product
in
order
to
try
and
optimize
use
case
for
market
participant
hedger
benefit
when
many
exchange
be
launch
many
different
product
to
try
and
tailor
to
their
need
they
suffer
when
the
government
limit
their
option
it
in
the
public
interest
for
such
innovation
to
occur
and
for
that
to
happen
the
commission
should
not
take
the
view
that
this
product
should
not
be
list
because
it
purportedly
can
be
hedge
through
other
mean
8
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
in
review
the
contract
hedging
function
be
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
use
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrate
need
by
likely
hedger
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
use
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participant
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedge
use
the
element
of
the
question
can
be
unpacked
as
follow
1
an
assumption
that
the
commission
should
review
a
contract
hedging
function
2
should
the
standard
for
hedging
be
theoretical
use
or
demonstrate
need
must
a
contract
participant
have
a
minimum
require
amount
of
hedging
either
in
absolute
or
percentage
term
the
exchange
will
address
these
seriatim
however
the
exchange
note
that
regardless
of
the
standard
the
contract
here
pass
kalshi
have
demonstrate
hedge
need
in
its
submission
to
dmo
in
march
kalshi
provide
many
example
of
consistent
evidence
of
ongoing
hedging
in
the

there
be
nothing
more
kalshi
and

could
have
do
in

to

the

need
this
product
fill
1
should
the

review
a

hedging
function
there
be
no
requirement
from

nor
mechanism
by
which
the

can
or
should
determine
hedge
utility
as
a
metric
on
its
own
outside
of

however
a

hedge
utility
can
be
consider
as
support
the

as

should
the

find
that

what
standard
should
the

use
theoretical
use
or
demonstrate
need
a

hedge
utility
may
be
an
important
consideration
in

of
find
that
a

be

should
the

find

it

be
a

of

the

note
however
that
these
two
suggestion
theoretical
versus
demonstrate
need
be
more
like
opposite
end
of
a
spectrum
and
there
be
variation
in
between
it
should
use
a
theoretical

standard
a
demonstrate

standard
could
inhibit
the
creation
of

with
small

less
clear

have
no
clear

by
which
it
can
be

and
because
a
contract
only
theoretically
be
use
for
hedging
be
not
contrary
to
the
public

it
should
not
be
miss
that
the
standard
imply
in
the
last
part
of
this
question
some
minimum
require
amount
of

in
absolute
or

term
would
be
likely
to
have
unintended
consequence
if
impose

this
standard

the

no

speculation
be
an
accept
important

case
for
all

speculation
on

be
not
equivalent
to

none

the

be
essential
to

kalshi
contract
specification
be
useful
for
retail
trader
as
well
as
small

medium

enterprise
this
be
a
positive
many
retail
and
small
business
commentator
such
as
retiree
scott
supak
argue
in
favor
of
the
utility
of
the
contract
for
hedge
in
the
more
immediate
political
future
the
hedge
benefit
be
obvious
since
I
no
long
employ
through
my
union
my
wife
no
long
have
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seem
that
republicans
be
likely
to
take
control
I
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premium
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
small
or
that
her
ability
to
purchase

at

be

it
would
undermine

risk
be

concern
for

who
would
have
greatly
help
our

and
will
remain
a
clear
and
tangible
risk
that
our
business
face
go
forward
this
be
a
great
example
of
exactly
the
use
case
of
kalshi
contract
and
the
fear
that
market
participant
have
not
just
that
a
particular
policy
will
be
enact

rather
that
a
government
hostile
to

could
be
elect
who
could
implement
myriad
such
policy
through

subsidy
judicial
nomination
taxation

such
an

do

whether

should
not

the

think
it

the

it

to

be

not

which
it
do
not
appear

especially
give
the
many
public

by

small

then
kalshi
will

in

improve
the

of
the

and
hedger

substitute
the

judgment
for
the

would
short
circuit
that
valuable
process
accordingly
the
commission
inquiry
into
hedging
as
part
of
its
public

inquiry
should
be
whether
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
as
note
however
the
contract
here
have
significant
hedging
utility
that
would
pass
any
of
these
test
moreover
different
firm
have
different
hedging
need
and
different
structure
can
well
meet
those
need
what
work
for
one
firm
may
not
work
well
for
another
firm
as
a
result
the
commission
should
not
attempt
to
speculate
about
whether
a
particular
structure
would
work
as
they
may
miss
many
firm
for
whom
an
alternative
structure
be
well
the
utility
of
the
market
be
that
there
exist
a
profit
incentive
to
create
product
for
even
niche
group
of
buyer
and
insofar
as
private
firm
be
far
close
to
their
potential
customer
base
than
a
government
agency
which
do
not
interact
with
they
on
a
daily
basis
unlike
an
exchange
it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
for
the
commission
to
impose
its
judgment
about
whether
a
product
structure
meet
potential
customer
need
it
in
the
public

to
permit

congressional

in

either

the

certainly

look

there
be
a
sharp
binary
discontinuity
in
economic
effect
when
control

perhaps
the

might
argue
that
while
congressional
control
be
binary
the
effect
of

be

some
people

that

for

people
could

point

the

the
reasoning
roughly
track
as
follow
when
no
money
be
at

people
conflate
their
belief
as

for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
be
definitely
go
to
win
the
2024
presidential
election
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenge
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odd
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
express
belief
as
mere
signal
lend
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
be
at
stake
they
be
able
to
differentiate
their
belief
from
their
preference
in
other
word
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrink
and
individual
who
trade
on
election
market
become
more
attune
to
fact
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
in
conclusion
the
contract
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
it
strongly
support
the
public
interest
as
demonstrate
by
the
evidence
above
the

1
the

will
not
harm

the
perception

it
be
important
for
the

to
engage
with
the

rather
than
speculate
the
nadex

suggestion
that

could
be
incentivize
to
switch
their

and
thus
harm
election
integrity
be
outright
speculative
in

and
have
since
be
disproven
by

political

what
experience

really

even

for

brief

whenever
blowhard

insist
that
some
outcome
be
go
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on

and
ask
they
why
they
think
that

be
wrong
and
whether
they
actually
put

I
be

similar

however
if

that

the

that

have
grossly
misalign
incentive
when
it
come
to
report
on

chance
these
misinformed
incentive
tend
to
come
from
three
source
first
pundit
may
want
to
hype
up
a
preferred
candidate
chance
in
order
to
flatter
the
sensibility
of
their
audience
second
pundit
may
want
to
directly
contradict
a
so
call
mainstream
line
about
a
candidate
win
in
order
to
gin
up
controversy
and
draw
more
click
or
viewership
as
a
result
they
may
claim
an
underdog
be
actually
the
true
favorite
and
to
further
court
controversy
and
viewership
claim
that
evidence
to
the
contrary
be
a
function
of
fraud
and
deception
third
even
when
pundit
attempt
to
be
honest
viewer
themselves
may
seek
out
information
that
confirm
their
own
bias
thus
reward
a
subset
of
relatively
dishonest
commentator
with
great
advertising
revenue
from
the
increase
viewership
or
readership
in
fact
we
have
empirical
evidence
of
the
dismal

conduct

and

in

if

believe

with

80
and

believe
it
with

then
the

and
a

the
gap
shrink
by
about
80
percent
the
reasoning
roughly
track
as
follow
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
conflate
their
belief
as
preference
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
be
definitely
go
to
win
the
2024
presidential
election
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenge
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odd
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
express
belief
as
mere
signal
lend
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
be
at
stake
they
be
able
to
differentiate
their
belief
from
their
preference
in
other
word
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrink
and
individual
who
trade
on
election
market
become
more
attune
to
fact
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
empower
researcher
and
policymaker
one
of
the
most
exciting
application
of
election
event
contract
be
their
ability
to
provide
powerful
new
causal
inference
tool
to
researcher
and
policymaker
right
now
estimate
the
effect
of
election
be
rather
difficult
one
can
not
merely
compare
economic
outcome
during
one
presidential
administration
versus
another
because
the
underlie
condition
have
dramatically
change
likewise
compare
forward
look
financial
indicator
before
and
after
election
day
run
into
several
problem
include
that
many
market
be
close
overnight
and
that
the
market
have
already
price
in
some
probability
of
the
eventual
victor
win
enter
political
control
contract
if
party
x
have
a
80
percent
chance
of
win
and
then
when
they
actually
win
on
election
night
a
stock
go
up
1
we
can
say
that
the
total
effect
of
the
election
be
5
percentage
point
if
go
from
80
to
100
be
1
then
go
from
0
to
100
be
roughly
5
but
it
can
get
even
strong
since
researcher
would
now
have
a
time
series
of
how
the
probability
change
over
time
they
can
use
other
event
like
debate
prominent
speech
and
the
revelation
of
major
scandal
to
regress
forward
look
financial
variable
on

outcome
in
a
way
impossible
without

these
tool
be
far
from
hypothetical
economist
justin

and
eric

have
already
conduct
several
study
that
use
previous

a

could
dramatically
expand
the
universe
of
question
researcher
could
answer
with
this
datum
beyond

a

would
create
a
large

for

to
develop

accurate

about

to
gain

famous
for
the
failure
of

a

to

make

fortunately
there

the

well

they

thus
make

the

could

no
the
concern
this

be

it

at

the
ability

the
implication
be
that
they
could
do
so
more
easily
by
provide
an
accurate
picture
of
the
state
of
the
race
then
public
polling
would
also
help
such
party
sidestep
federal
law
a
plainly
untenable
proposition
as
describe
early
it
be
not
plausible
for
any
actor
to
try
and
create
momentum
for
their
party
by
buy
up
one
side
share
one
may
also
imagine
that
a
coordinated
group
of
individual
may
conspire
to
manipulate
market
price
to
give
the
false
impression
of
candidate
momentum
thus
potentially
harm
the
democratic
process
this
concern
have
be
test
several
time
by
researcher
with
all
attempt
fail
koleman
and
strumpf
in
a
later
paper
examine
previous
american
political
prediction
market
and
find
that
no
previous
effort
at
manipulation
be
capable
of
sustain
anything
more
than
fleeting
price
movement
they
write
we
find
little
evidence
that
political
stock
market
can
be
systematically
manipulate
beyond
short

period
paul
rhode
and
koleman
strumpf

manipulate
political
stock
market
a
field
experiment
and
a
century

moreover
the
market
examine
be
much
small
and
thus
even
more
prone
to
manipulation
than
a
fully
regulate
liquid
market
like
a
dcm
as
a
result
the
probability
of
manipulation
be
implausible
indeed
as
george
mason
university

robin

and
university

ryan
oprea
find
in
one
paper
one
major
reason
why
political

be

invulnerable

that
