relate
to
illegal
off
exchange
activity
my
interest
in
provide
the
comment
below
be
to
be
able
to
share
the
institutional
knowledge
I
develop
over
my
year
at
the
commission
to
assist
you
in
reach
a
decision
with
respect
to
the
product
before
you
I
encourage
the
commission
to
recognize
the
value
and
importance
of
election
market
although
event
contract
have
not
historically
be
the
type
of
instrument
that
the
commission
have
be
charge
with
regulate
congress
more
recently
in
dodd
frank
have
see
it
appropriate
to
authorize
the
commission
to
regulate
these
market
as
the
commission
have
recognize
through
its
various
enforcement
and
similar
action
for
example
intrade
the
iowa
electronic
market
predictit
and
nadex
on
election
market
these
market
have
be
appropriately
determined
to
be
within
the
commission
jurisdiction
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
while
event
contract
be
relatively
new
the
commission
be
the
appropriate
choice
of
regulator
I
believe
that
the
commission
through
its
staff
have
significant
expertise
in
regulate
important
and
valuable
market
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
can
successfully
regulate
these
market
too
what
I
would
like
to
offer
to
the
commission
in
this
comment
letter
be
an
expansion
on
my
view
as
to
what
I
see
as
the
most
important
issue
involve
in
approve
these
election
contract
I
see
three
issue
first
I
want
to
clarify
that
event
contract
differ
from
future
and
option
contract
and
present
different
consideration
second
even
though
they
be
new
to
the
scene
congress
have
place
these
contract
under
the
commission
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
have
act
on
that
grant
third
these
contract
be
not
game
and
be
in
the
public
interest
because
they
essentially
be
a
competitor
to
opinion
poll
and
likely
a
well
product
future
or
option
event
contract
be
not
future
or
option
and
they
do
not
have
the
hallmark
of
future
and
option
of
be
base
on
a
price
as
an
example
if
the
price
of
corn
go
up
by
x
or
down
by
y
the
price
of
the
future
contract
will
roughly
change
by
x
or
for
an
option
the
contract
will
go
or
out
of
the
money
base
on
the
price
change
of
the
underlie
commodity
if
in
the
money
it
will
rise
or
fall
in
sync
with
the
underlie
price
change
event
contract
be
not
base
on
an
underlie
price
give
that
these
be
not
traditional
future
or
option
contract
the
question
be
whether
congress
have
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
regulate
they
and
whether
the
commission
have
assume
that
authority
I
address
this
question
next
congressional
and
commission
approval
while
I
be
not
offer
a
legal
opinion
here
as
discuss
above
I
do
believe
that
the
language
in
the
act
regard
event
contract
show
that
congress
entrust
the
commission
with
regulate
these
market
I
also
note
that
action
take
by
the
commission
do
establish
that
the
commission
more
likely
than
not
have
jurisdiction
over
these
contract
regardless
of
how
the
commission
ultimately
decide
on
the
product
before
its
consideration
now
I
encourage
that
you
take
this
opportunity
to
clearly
state
the
commission
position
on
these
contract
these
election
contract
be
valuable
contract
and
be
not
game
because
event
contract
be
not
future
or
option
they
present
different
consideration
to
the
commission
one
useful
factor
that
the
commission
can
use
in
decide
whether
to
approve
an
event
contract
be
if
the
contract
be
valuable
in
a
public
interest
sense
that
lead
to
the
question
of
whether
election
contract
be
valuable
in
a
public
interest
sense
I
argue
yes
these
contract
be
not
game
election
be
event
that
be
very
important
to
the
public
and
there
be
a
very
strong
public
interest
in
have
accurate
datum
regard
election
this
be
clear
from
the
very
prominent
place
that
election
polling
play
in
society
as
state
above
these
contract
will
benefit
the
public
interest
by
give
the
public
datum
that
would
complement
or
even
compete
with
opinion
poll
but
with
the
advantage
that
participant
in
the
market
have
a
monetary
stake
in
their
opinion
election
have
far
more
importance
in
a
public
interest
sense
than
sport
event
or
other
trivial
matter
the
public
be
well
serve
by
a
regulated
market
that
be
subject
to
oversight
and
surveillance
than
by
opinion
poll
that
be
unregulate
and
where
participant
have
no
incentive
in
provide
sincere
response
my
recommendation
be
that
the
commission
approve
the
request
by
the
kalshi
exchange
to
list
political
event
contract
and
election
contract
I
would
also
encourage
the
commission
to
take
this
opportunity
to
revisit
the
2008
concept
release
73
fed
reg
25669
and
provide
additional
clarity
on
the
type
of
event
that
be
appropriate
for
commission
regulation
I
be
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
give
input
on
this
matter
and
be
confident
that
these
important
market
will
be
an
important
addition
to
the
market
that
thrive
under
the
commission
regulation
sincerely
gregory
