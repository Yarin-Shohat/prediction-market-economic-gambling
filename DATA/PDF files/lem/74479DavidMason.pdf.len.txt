prior

there
be

it

relative

conjure

that
the

have
permit

in

already
engage
in
the

at
the

this
strike
incuriosity
about

market
the

approve

allow
to
operate
for
over
three
decade
give
the
strong
appearance
that
the
outcome
of
the
rulemaking
be
pre
decide
and
that
evidence
be
optional
and
perhaps
welcome
only
when
it
fit
the
conclusion
the
commission
should
suspend
the
current
nprm
and
return
to
the
drawing
board
to
examine
the
experience
beneficial
or
harmful
of
the
election
prediction
market
the
commission
allow
to
operate
for
such
extended
period
election
be
not
game
and
election
contract
be
not
game
the
commission
entire
effort
to
ban
election
contract
can
be
boil
down
to
the
argument
that
election
be
contest
and
contest
be
game
this
argument
be
a
glaring
example
of
the
logical
fallacy
of
equivocation
use
a
key
word
or
phrase
in
an
ambiguous
way
I
rather
have
a
ham
sandwich
than
eternal
happiness
because
nothing
be
well
than
eternal
happiness
and
a
ham
sandwich
be
well
than
nothing
the
effort
also
rest
on
a
stretched
and
selective
choice
of
definition
from
state
gaming

that
be
further
evidence
of
outcome
base
reason
political

be
often
refer
to
even
in

to

see
the

the

be
convert
from

to
political
use
and
indeed
the

be
still
use
to
describe
both
political
and
military
contest
that
dual
usage
do
not
however
convert
election
into
battle
though
that
term
be
also
use
in
both
political
and
military
context
or
war
subject
to
the
prohibition
of

by
that
logic
take
speculative

in

would
be

since
do
so
be
often
refer
to

the

definition
of
gaming
be
both
overbroad
and
under
inclusive
and
its
use
of
the
definition
to
ban
election
contract
be
inappropriate
the
cftc
proposal
would
prohibit
contract
that
relate
to
a
a
contest
of
other
and
it
specify
that
contract
relate
to
the
outcome
of
election
would
be
prohibit
under
this
propose
rule
the
commission
must
recognize
that
its
propose
definition
of
gaming
threaten
to
swallow
up
the
entire
category
of
event
contract
this
definition
also
ignore
a
critical
component
of
the
word
gaming
which
be
its
nexus
with
event
that
can
reasonably
be
classify
as
game
election
be
not
game
and
the
cftc
attempt
to
classify
they
as
such
ignore
the
very
significant
real
world
effect
of
their
result
in
the
absence
of
a
definition
of
gaming
in
the
cea
or
federal
law
the
cftc
refer
to
state
law
definition
of
gaming
or
gamble
the
most
common
definition
of
gaming
under
state
law
involve
wager
money
on
a

contingent

not
under
the
control
of
the
participant
to

the
cftc
reject
this
most
common
definition
however
because
it
obviously
would
swallow
up
every
future
contract
ever
write
the
commission
then
latch
on
to
a
less
common
state

definition
involve

apply
it
as

there

category
could
trigger
the

kalshi
order
at

the
exchange
would
also
note
that
the
cftc
base
its
2023
rejection
of
kalshi
propose
contract
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
medium
sometimes
use
the
word
contest
in
connection
with
the
underlying
of
the
propose
contract
kalshi
order
at

the
exchange
would
reasonably
conclude
that
pharmaceutical
manufacturer
be
engage
in
contest
against
their
competitor
to
sell
medication
and
acquire
market
share
a
drug
manufacturer
such
as
ozempic
producer
novo
nordisk
would
certainly
describe
itself
as
be
engage
in
a
struggle
for
superiority
in
market
share
against
competitor
like
mounjaro
producer
eli
lilly
both
of
these
company
and
product
be
far
engage
in
competition
against
traditional
weight
loss
program
offer
by
company
like
weight
watcher
and
noom
the
exchange
would
have
to
conclude
that
it
could
not
offer
this
contract
the
exchange
would
similarly
have
to
shelve
its
plan
to
offer
a
contract
on
whether
a
corporate
ceo
would
remain
in
office
because
the
ceo
could
reasonably
be
describe
as
be
in
competition
with
rival
candidate
for
his
position
a
contract
on
a
corporate
merger
would
also
be
off
the
table
because
corporation
frequently
make
compete
offer
and
use
buyout
to
build
market
share
and
battle
for
supremacy
in
the
marketplace
the
exchange
would
then
have
to
conclude
that
the
propose
rule
prohibit
contract
on
us
semiconductor
production
growth
because
the
united
states
and
china
be
often
describe
in
medium
as
be
in
a
competition
or
battle
for
supremacy
over
the
production
of
these
chip
phase
a
contract
on
advancement
in
artificial
intelligence
would
similarly
be
imperil
because
it
relate
directly
to
competition
between
different
tech
company
and
nation
state
the
cftc
through
its
propose
rule
may
not
have
intend
to
ban
these
type
of
contract
the
cftc
overtly
want
to
ban
contract
relate
to
election
and
award
show
but
for
unclear
reason
the
cftc
choose
to
do
so
by
promulgate
an
overbroad
definition
of
gaming
whereby
any
event
contract
that
could
reasonably
be
describe
as
involve
a
contest
and
that
be
not
explicitly
define
as
be
an
economic
indicator
would
be
prohibit
the

make

these

like

if
we
have
intend
to
include

we
would
have
do
so
explicitly
the

now
know
that
it
be
interpret
the

use
a
piece
of
legislative
history
in
direct
opposition
to
the

of
the

the

must
be
reconsider
in

of
the
clarification
by

the

of

of

make
it
clear
that

intend

this
propose

stray
too
far
from
this
intent
the
cftc
be
correct
to
argue
that
it
need
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
contract
that
would
be
functionally
indistinguishable
from
sport
gambling
a
dcm
could
for
example
propose
a
contract
on
which
city
would
host
a
game
of
the
major
league
baseball
mlb
world
series
because
mlb
game
be
typically
play
in
one
of
the
stadium
of
a

team
this
contract
would
correlate
directly
with
the
winner
of
the
league
playoff
round
that
immediately
precede
the

series
the
cftc
would
be
correct
to
determine
that
this
contract
involve
game
under

cfr
the
notion
though
that
the
congressional
prohibition
on

that
relate

could
possibly
have
be
intend
to
sweep
up
any

contract
that
can
reasonably
be
tie
to

be
ludicrous
the
cftc
have
provide
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
intend
to
use
the
word
game
in
a
way
that
prohibit
contract
on
medication
prescription

congress
also

to

request
for
comment
on
the
possibility
of

for
essentially
these
same
reason
the
commission
may
not
use
the

category
to
expand
the

of

the

clearly
begin
at
a
conclusion
that
it
want
to

and
build
this

to
arrive
at
that
conclusion
the

must
address
the
unintended
consequence
of
this
broad
definition
and
either
propose
a
narrow
definition
of

one
that
recognize
that

involve

or
scrap
this
proposed

the

in

2020

80
percent
of

be
sell
at

once
prior

contrast
this
with
the
typical
all

structure
of
a
gambling
bet
once
a
gambling
bet
be
make
there
be
no
secondary
market
where
a
participant
can
exit
the

while
the
final
payout
structure
in
gaming
and
prediction
market
be
similar
all
to
the
correct
side
and
nothing
to
the
incorrect
side
the
free
tradability
of
prediction
market
position
prior
to

make
the
us
and
behavior
of
prediction
market
position
quite
different
from

on
predictit
typical
trader
do
not
buy
and
hold
share
to
the
payout
date
for
an
all
or
nothing
result
but
instead
make
an
investment
observe
a
profit
or
loss
and
exit
the
market
via
a
trade
with
a
payout
of
some
amount
other
than
the
binary
0

similar
behavior
be
evident
in
non

future
market
where
many
trader
take
and
then
exit

before

for

the
fact
that

whether

once
the

congress
could

do
not

the

congress
do
not
do
that
despite
the

have

and
member
of

course
understand

then
congress

that
the

now

first
it
be
not
clear
the
propose
amendment
proffer
justification
for
prohibit
event
contract
in
electoral
outcome
be
ground
in
legitimate
interest
for
example
the
concern
about
misinformation
or
inauthentic
voter
choice
be
fundamentally
a
concern
about
political
speech
and
vote
the
government
have
essentially
no
power
to
regulate
the
content
of
political
speech
and
so
logically
it
be
not
clear
the
commission
have
any
legitimate
interest
in
prohibit
event
contract
base
on
concern
about
misinformation
in
political
speech
any
attempt
to
ban
politically
relate
activity
due
to
government
concern
about
the
content
of
related
political
speech
would
clearly
violate
the
first

similarly
the
commission
profess
concern
with
voter
be
incentivize
to
vote
against
their
interest
be
a
core
personal
choice
protect
by
a
secret

and
subject
to
a
dizzying
array
of

financial
or
otherwise
so
too
of
concern
about
how
market
may
affect
the
outcome
of
election
event
contract
about
election
may
affect
outcome
by
supply
voter
with
useful
information
about
the
relative
strength
of
candidate
at
any
give
moment
in
that
regard
event
contract
produce
useful
information
to
supplement
polling
and
political
commentary
the
commission
have
no
legitimate
interest
in
squelch
information
source
on
the
theory
that
they
may
affect
election
because
the
whole
point
of
information
be
to
affect
election
outcome
indeed
the
supreme
court
have
hold
that
the
first
amendment
have
particular
application
in
the

of

generally

we

and

the
last
thing
we
want
be
the
commission
decide
what
information
be
good
or
bad
when
it
come
to
election
the
obvious
solution
be
to
allow
event
contract
on
election
result
not
ban
they
second
whatever
legitimate
interest
may
be
at
stake
there
be
no
rational
relationship
between
those

and
a
blanket
ban
on
event
contract
in
electoral
outcome
to
the
contrary
the
propose
amendment
justification
for
such
a
ban
seem
like
fantasy
there
be
no
evidence
for

that
small
scale
market
such
as
the
iowa
electronic
market
or
predictit
or
such
market
in
overseas
jurisdiction
have
result
in
information
manipulation
or
election
come
out
differently
in
a
way
the
cftc
should
care
about
as
just
discuss
one
valuable
effect
of
event
contract
in
election
be
that
they
produce
useful
information
for
voter
that
may
affect
electoral
outcome
and
that
be
a
good
thing
the
notion
that
more
and
well
information
will
result
in
some
sinister
consequence
for
democracy
and
that
the
commission
must
protect
we
from
that
dark

be
an
overwrought

premise
on

this

it
