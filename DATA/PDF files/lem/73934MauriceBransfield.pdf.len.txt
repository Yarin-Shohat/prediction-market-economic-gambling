we
thank

for
their
useful
comment
all

remain
our
own
the
2020
presidential
election
garner
notable
global
attention
from
market
participant
which
be
reflect
to
some
degree
in
immediate
change
in
asset
price
since
financial
market
respond
rapidly
to
new
and
diverse
information
it
be
difficult
to
disentangle
any
one
event
impact
however
the
election
offer
a
unique
opportunity
to
overcome
this
identification
obstacle
major
result
come
in
overnight
a
sufficiently
small

that
concurrent

be
limit
in
scope
use
a
novel

source
to
get
minutely
estimate
of
probability
for
the
presidential
outcome
we
examine
the
relationship
between
the
2020
election
and
various
financial
market
we
find
striking
correlation
between
the
presidential
election
outcome
probability
and
major
financial
indicator
include

and
a

measure
the
correlation
be
consistent
with

on
behavior
in
market
a
term
which
describe
investor
move
toward
risky
asset
class
as
the
election
result
become
clear
far
we
decompose
the
market
reaction
into
a
reduction
in
uncertainty
component
and
a
probability
of
a
democratic
party
presidency
component
this
decomposition
reveal
how
market
react
to
the
increase
certainty
of
the
outcome
as
election
result
come
in
finally
we
analyze
the
differ
market
reaction
to
the
presidential
election
and
the
senate
election
include
datum
from
the
unique
georgia
runoff
and
demonstrate
that
bond
price
be
particularly
sensitive
to
the
