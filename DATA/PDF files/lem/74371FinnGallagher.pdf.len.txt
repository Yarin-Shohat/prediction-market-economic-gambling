I
be
write
to
express
my
concern
regard
the
commission
proposal
to
ban
election
contract
and
prediction
market
it
appear
that
there
have
be
a
misinterpretation
of
former
senator
blanche
lincoln
2010
colloquy
the
intent
behind
her
remark
be
not
to
prohibit
these
market
her
comment
make
this
very
clear
but
to
encourage
innovation
within
a
regulate
framework
senator
lincoln
discussion
with
senator
feinstein
focus
on
ensure
that
contract
serve
a
hedging
or
economic
purpose
rather
than
be
predominantly
speculative
however
this
should
not
be
construe
as
a
call
to
ban
election
market
entirely
but
rather
to
regulate
they
appropriately
to
ensure
they
serve
the
public
interest
furthermore
the
cftc
definition
of
gaming
as
it
pertain
to
political
contest
be
problematic
the
agency
interpretation
seem
to
conflate
legitimate
financial
instrument
with
gambling
which
mischaracterize
the
economic
utility
these
market
provide
election
market
can
offer
valuable
insight
into
public
sentiment
and
serve
as
tool
for
manage
risk
associate
with
political
outcome
they
be
not
merely
speculative
wager
but
can
have
genuine
hedging
application
for
business
and
investor
the
argument
that
allow
election
market
would
position
the
cftc
as
election
cop
be
flawed
proper
regulation
rather
than
prohibition
can
address
concern
about
market
integrity
and
electoral
influence
by
establish
a
clear
regulatory
framework
the
cftc
can
ensure
that
these
market
operate
transparently
and
ethically
without
overstep
its
mandate
I
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
and
focus
on
create
a
regulatory
environment
that
allow
for
innovation
and
the
safe
operation
of
election
market
this
approach
would
prevent
activity
from
move
offshore
to
unregulated
platform
and
ensure
that
american
consumer
and
business
can
benefit
from
these
market
within
a
secure
and
overseen
system
