it
be
crucial
that

so
that

have
certainty
regard
regulatory
requirement
in
the
case
of
the
kalshiex
contract
there
appear
to
be
confusion
on
the
application
of
the
cftc
regulation
and
the
standard
implement
cftc
rule
set
forth
a
prohibition
on
the

enumerate
in

this
part
and
that
the

determine
by

or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
kalshiex
congressional

contract
do
not
appear
to
be
capture
by
any
of
the
enumerate
activity
in
congressional
election
be
not
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
ice
support
and
agree
with
commissioner
pham
dissent
and
analysis
on
this
point
her
dissent
be
available
at
the
commission
should
also
apply
its
rule
uniformly
and
fairly
across
its
contract
market
ice
note
the
disparate
treatment
between
the
kalshiex
event
contract
which
be
put
out
for
a
90
day
review
and
cme
recently
launch
event
contract
which
be
allow
to
be
self
certify
because
of
the
different
approach
take
with
the
cme
question
regard
the
advisability
of
a
contract
that
invite
retail
speculation
on
the
settlement
price
of
an
exchange
own
future
contract
will
be
leave
for
determination
by
the
marketplace
precisely
the
opportunity
that
kalshiex
be
deny
with
respect
to
its
contract
when
the
commission
incorrectly
invoke
regulation
ice
believe
it
be
imperative
that
the
commission
implement
clear
process
and
consistently
apply
regulation
ice
understand
the
specific
consideration
give
to
election
contract
however
the
length
of
time
for
the
cftc
to
decide
on
kalshiex
political
event
contract
be
concern
a
prolong
delay
in
receive
clarity
on
list
new
product
be
a
disservice
to
the
regulated
exchange
and
market
participant
in
addition
a
prolong
delay
impede
the
exchange
ability
to
be
competitive
in
this
situation
an
extended
review
period
by
the
commission
will
take
kalshiex
beyond
the
event
to
which
the
contract
relate
the
mid
term
election
the
process
to
list
new
product
include
staff
review
should
be
complete
within
a
timeframe
that
foster
innovation
and
should
not
