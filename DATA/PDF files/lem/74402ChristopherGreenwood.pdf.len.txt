the

commission
question
1
the
propose

do
not
constitute
gaming
as
reference
in
commission
regulation
and
the
commodity
exchange
act
before
address
statutory
and
regulatory
definition
of
gaming
there
be
an
obvious
and
critical
distinction
between
binary
prediction
market
as
operate
by
predictit
and
kalshi
and
gaming
prediction
market
position
be
tradeable
gaming
bet
and
wager
generally
be
not
while
the
final
payout
structure
in
gaming
and
prediction
market
be
similar
all
to
the
correct
side
and
nothing
to
the
incorrect
side
the
free
tradability
of
prediction
market
position
prior
to
close
make
the
us
and
behavior
of
prediction
market
position
quite
different
from
gaming
to
take
one
example
from
predictit
in
the
2020
presidential
market
there
be
share
purchase
of
that
total
over
61
be
sell
before
expiration
the
typical
trader
in
that
market
do
not
buy
and
hold
share
to
the
payout
date
for
an
all
or
nothing
result
but
instead
make
an
investment
observe
a
profit
or
loss
and
exit
the
market
via
a
trade
with
a
payout
of
some
amount
other
than
the
binary
0
or
1
similar
behavior
be
evident
in
nonbinary
future
market
where
many
trader
take
and
then
exit
position
before
settlement
date
free
tradability
and
the
ability
to
exit
position
prior
to
the
trigger
event
be
such
a
fundamental
distinction
from
ordinary
gaming
that
parse
of
the
meaning
of
whether
a
binary
prediction
contract
to
gaming
seem
unnecessary
but
we
believe
that
a
correct
reading
of
the
statute
especially
in
light
of
the
development
of
trade
practice
since
2012
also
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
binary
prediction
contract
such
as
those
propose
by
kalshi
be
not
game
nor
do
they
relate
to
gaming
commission
regulation
prohibit
contract
that
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
in
its
nadex
order
the
commission
reject
the
common
sense
read
that
the
underlie
commodity
behind
the
contract
need
to
be
base
upon
the
outcome
of
a
game
such
as
card
or
football
to
fall
within
the
prohibition
and
state
that
allow
the
contract
would
be
akin
to
allow
gambling
on
election
per
the
nadex
order
election
themselves
be
not
game
but
the
act
of
invest
in
the
propose
contract
on
election
constitute
impermissible
game
this
of
course
be
the
same
economically
uninformed
argument
that
have
be
make
against
commodity
market
from
their
inception
similar
argument
could
be
make
regard
any
contract
on
an
event
that
lack
underlie
cash
value
but
the
commission
have
approve
or
allow
hundred
of
such
contract
consider
several

currently

include
the

the

much
