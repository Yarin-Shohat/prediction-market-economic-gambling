support

we
be
concerned
that

ensure
that

that

thus

recommend
that
the

drop

undertake

then
it
may
undertake
a
notice
and
comment
process
but
that
process
also
be
subject
to
compress
timeline
this
entire
process
stand
in
sharp
contrast
to
rule
change
by
register

the
security
and
exchange
commission
rule
mandate
that
all
register
security
exchange
rule
change
be
formally
file
with
the
agency
all
exchange
filing
be
put
out
for
public
comment
and
the
sec
have
much
more
time
to
intervene
the
cftc
decision
to
simply
adopt
internal
rule
to
relieve
itself
of
its
burden
to
effectively
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
and
the
core
principle
be
inconsistent
with
its
mission
the
law
and
its
regulatory
peer
not
surprisingly
the
commission
have
thus
allow
increasingly
complex
product
to
come
to
market
include
crypto
future
product
without
any
meaningful
intervention
new
product
filing
and
rule
change
be
rarely
challenge
by
the
agency
and
when
they
be
the
agency
be
likely
to
be
challenge
in
court
in
part
because
it
have
voluntarily
create
for
itself
a
nearly
impossible
standard
to
meet
within
the
time
allot
thus
the
commission
own
rule
act
as
a
material
deterrent
to
its
own
exercise
of
authority
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
and
core
principle
despite
all
of
these
shortcoming
the
proposal
preserve
for
dcms
the
exist
lax
procedural
safeguard
which
will
allow
for
list
contract
that
could
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
or
otherwise
not
comply
with
the
core
principle
rather
than
ensure
compliance
with
the
law
and
core
principle
the
commission
invite
further
expansion
of
non
compliant
contract
it
seem
naïve
to
assume
for
example
that
market
participant
will
no
long
try
to
find
innovative
mean
of
speculate
on
various
aspect
of
political
election
and
policy
outcome
there
be
an
infinite
variety
of
such
possibility
bad
because
the
agency
have
give
itself
such
little
advance
notice
it
likely
would
not
be
able
to
intervene
until
after
a
product
be
list
and
trade
at
that
point
the
agency
would
be
face
with
the
prospect
of
create
new
investor
and
market
harm

to

the

the

be
a
core
responsibility
of

be
critical
to

congress

essential
responsibility
of
the

conclusion
we
strongly
support
the
proposal
codification
of
the
prohibition
of
contract
that
be
directly
or
indirectly
base
on
the
outcome
of

as

as
the
additional
clarification
around
game
other
enumerate
activity
and
assessment
of
whether
a

be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
part
of
the
proposal
should
be
finalize
at
the
same
time
we
doubt
that
these
change
will
reduce
the
burden
on
the
agency
to
review
dcm
filing
we
remain
concerned
that
the
agency
will
continue
its
excessive
dependence
upon
the
self
interested
and
conflicted
judgment
of
the
dcms
in
determine
what
potential
listing
comply
with
the
law
and
core
principle
to
address
this
concern
we
recommend
that
the
commission
expand
its
review
and
analysis
of
dcm
listing
and
rule
change
and
seek
the
congressional
funding

to
accomplish
