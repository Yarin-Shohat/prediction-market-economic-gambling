I
be
dr
eric
crampton
chief
economist
with
the
new
zealand
initiative
in
wellington
new
zealand
we
be
a
public
policy
think
tank
with
the
initiative
I
author
jointly
with
internet
new
zealand
analog
regulation
digital
world
a
stocktake
on
the
state
of
regulation
in
new
zealand
as
it
relate
to
the
digital
economy
that
report
include
a
section
on
new
zealand
experience
with
ipredict
an
early
and
innovative
prediction
market
on
political
event
prior
to
join
the
initiative
I
be
senior
lecturer
in
economic
with
the
university
of
canterbury
equivalent
of
we
associate
professor
I
serve
as
academic
advisor
to
ipredict
while
at
canterbury
and
supervise
graduate
work
use
prediction
market
datum
I
maintain
an
adjunct
senior
fellow
position
with
the
university
I
urge
the
cftc
not
only
to
allow
kalshi
to
run
market
on
congressional
outcome
but
also
to
simplify
the
process
for
the
opening
of
such
market
a
prediction
market
should
not
have
to
run
cap
in
hand
to
its
regulator
for
authorisation
of
every
contract
there
be
no
risk
to
be
mitigate
that
be
commensurate
with
that
level
of
regulatory
cost
and
it
foreclose
opportunity
to
open
new
contract
in
response
to
event
prediction
contract
on
election
and
congressional
event
open
opportunity
for
discover
the
likelihood
of
different
outcome
and
hedge
against
those
risk
at
least
as
importantly
they
can
provide
the
basis
for
estimate
the
effect
of
different
policy
outcome
future
contract
on
political
event
be
no
more
akin
to
gambling
than
be
future
contract
on
oil
price
each
trader
bring
their
information
to
the
platform
help
to
move
price
toward
a
more
accurate
reflection
of
true
underlying
probability
work
by
oprea
and
hanson
a
decade
ago
hanson
amp
oprea
2009
a
manipulator
can
aid

market
accuracy

show
that
these
market
be
resilient
to
speculative
or
motivated
attack
a
trader
seek
to
push
the
price
around
to
make
their
preferred
candidate
or
policy
look
well
or
bad
simply
provide
liquidity
that
attract
trader
to
profit
by
bring
price
back
to
fundamental
value
and
the
experience
we
have
at
ipredict
be
consistent
with
hanson
and
oprea
lab
work
ipredict
trace
price
of
its
contract
against
outcome
if
a
contract
close
at
1
if
an
event
occur
and
at
0
if
it
do
not
contract
trade
at
ahead
of
closure
should
pay
out
at
1
around
10
of
the
time
and
it
turn
out
that
contract
trading
at
pay
out
about
one
time
in
five
contract
trading
at
pay
out
at
1
about
50
of
the
time
and
so
on
there
be
a
bit
of
bias
in
the
tail
with
overpricing
of
very
longshot
bet
and
underpricing
of
sure
thing
but
none
of
it
seem
base
on
manipulation
just
liquidity
and
hold
cost
issue
the
market
just
work
ipredict
wind
up
close
not
because
of
any
issue
in
the
market
but
because
the
regulatory
burden
become
too
great
the
market
consist
of
hundred
of
very
small
trader
and
few
large
trader
in
part
because
deposit
limit
be
too
stringent
but
lot
and
lot
of
small
value
account
mean
that
when
our
regulator
impose
aml
know
your
customer
regulation
at
a
time
when
automated
kyc
mechanism
have
yet
be
develop
to
any
reasonable
extent
the
market
face
impossible
cost
relative
to
its
scale
and
it
close
total
balance
hold
by
ipredict
at
the
time
be
on
the
order
of
and
most
of
its
trader
have
account
balance
below
the
cost
of
kyc
onboarde
hedge
opportunity
matter
though
those
opportunity
may
be
limit
if
the
maximum
allow
deposit
be
too
low
outcome
across
industry
range
from
defence
and
energy
to
agriculture
and
transport
can
vary
considerably
depend
on
the
composition
of
congress
and
whether
control
shift
be
able
to
hedge
against
those
risk
can
matter
it
would
in
this
case
be
particularly
important
for
small
business
for
a
large
company
where
change
in
congress
can
be
worth
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
hedge
in
a
market
subject
to
tight
deposit
limit
be
of
fairly
limit
value
but
it
could
be
important
for
small
business
and
subcontractor
and
their
employee
and
everyone
can
make
use
of
the
information
provide
through
the
price
that
emerge
in
these
market
enable
they
to
make
well
inform
decision
price
on
political
and
congressional
event
do
just
provide
option
for
hedging
which
can
be
really
important
hedger
provide
liquidity
that
draw
in
trader
who
be
purely
interested
in
the
raw
likelihood
of
the
event
transpire
help
to
improve
price
they
also
provide
opportunity
for
combinatorial
market
down
the
track
thing
like
for
example
what
will
the
unemployment
rate
be
in
september
2023
if
policy
x
be
approve
by
congress
and
what
will
it
be
if
policy
x
be
not
approve
by
congress
this
kind
of
information
can
be
of
immense
value
but
if
every
new
contract
have
to
run
through
this
kind
of
process
where
you
even
have
to
get
submission
from
economist
out
in
new
zealand
it
just
far
less
likely
to
happen
these
market
need
flexiblity
to
respond
to
event
as
they
transpire
what
experience
we
have
with
ipredict
suggest
cftc
really
do
have
anything
substantial
to
worry
about
in
allow
contract
on
political
event
if
anything
they
heighten
voter
engagement
the
ce
of
ipredict
even
feature
on
the
nightly
news
during
the
election
give
the
late
on
election
market
price
and
for
that
brief
period
whenever
blowhard
partisan
insist
that
some
outcome
be
go
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on
the
event
and
ask
they
why
they
think
that
price
be
wrong
and
whether
they
actually
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
be
it
be
a
remarkable
era
ipredict
inflation
forecast
they
also
have
market
on
inflation
go
out
several
year
it
be
so
very
good
wound
up
be
note
in
our
reserve
bank
monetary
policy
statement
I
desperately
miss
it
I
envy
the
opportunity
americans
could
have
if
cftc
take
a
sensible
approach
to
regulation
