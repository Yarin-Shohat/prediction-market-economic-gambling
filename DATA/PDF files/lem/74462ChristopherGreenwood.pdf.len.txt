the

the
precise
test

to

as

serve
the
bona

purpose
of

hedge
in
the

way

can
argue

of

depend

a

economic

which
instead
will
be
drive
primarily
by
the
research
perform
in
addition
where
the
opportunity
for
bona
fide
risk
hedging
be
present
and
contract
trade
on
an
organized

regulated
market
the
activity
should
not
be
consider
illegal
gambling
wagering

bet
under

though
state
have
an
interest
in
prohibit
these
illegal
activity
which
be
different
from
economic
hedging
activity
the
propose
event
contract
like
other
event
contract
should
be
consider
legal
hedging
activity
any
concern
that
state
might
have
with
respect
to
the
propose

be
far
mitigate
by
the
fact
that
the

the

the

note
in

that
it

the

to
the

whether

to

the
cftc
conclude
that
the
political
event
contract
consider
in

could
potentially
be
use
in
way
that
would
have
an
adverse

the
underlying
question
of

be
about
the
cumulative
result
of
hundred
of
separate
election
through

electoral
district
in

the

that

in

demonstrate
the
strong

preserve

the

the
inclusion

would
greatly
enhance

the
current
scene
of

with
the
strength

of

iv
conclusion
the
propose

contract
serve
a
clear
economic
purpose
that
meet
both
the
hedging
and
the
price
basing
need
of
trader
with
a
commercial
interest
in
the
aggregate
outcome
of
the
midterm
election
the
economic
benefit
of

will

greatly
enhance
if
it
be
permit
to
trade
on
the
kalshi

moreover
to
the
extent
that
the

base
dominant
factor
test
be
apply
to
the
propose

contract
the
outcome
of
trader
in
this
contract
will
not
be
derive
primarily
from
luck
or
chance
base
on
the
underlie
extrinsic
economic
utility
of
the
propose

contract
to
be
available
on
the
kalshi

the
regulatory
oversight
the
kalshi
dcm
will
be
subject
to
we
do
not
believe
that
the
propose
event
contract
should
be
treat
as
involve
gaming
or
against
law
or
otherwise
against
public
interest
and
should
be
