whatever

the

plain

and
purpose
that
it
clearly
can

the
cftc
public

analysis
be
also
fatally
flaw
the
propose
contract
serve
an
empirically
supportable
hedging
function
and
the
cftc
analysis
of
the
utility
of
hedging
be
far
too
narrow
it
also
fail
to
recognize
the
non
economic
benefit
of
prediction

finally
the
cftc
conclude
that
kalshiex
prediction
market
might
lead
to
election
manipulation
but
it
fail
to
explain
why
it
reach
that
conclusion
in
the
face
of
abundant
contrary
evidence
the
cftc
reasoning
be
especially
troubling
because
it
can
extend
to
many
prediction
market
that
be
not
relate
to

thus
cause
a
major
and
unwarranted
expansion
of
the
cftc
regulatory
authority
in

manner
that
would
contrary

the
statute
plain
text
cause
multitude
of
event
contract
to
be
forbid
by
the
agency
argument
the
cftc
interpretation
of
gaming
be
inconsistent
with
the
statute
the
cftc
conclude
that
political
event
contract
involve
game
within
the
meaning
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
thus
authorize
the
cftc
to
ban
they
indeed
the
cftc
decision
to
reject
the
propose
contract
hinge
critically
on
the
determination
that
the
propose
election
contract
involve
a
game
if
an
election
be
not
a
game
or
do
not
involve
a
game
the
cftc
have
no
statutory
basis
upon
which
to
reject
the
contract
the
definition
of
gaming
and
of
the
term
involve
be
thus
outcome
dispositive
but
here
the
cftc
decision
misread
the
statute
and
give
the
cftc
arbitrary
and
unrestrained
authority
far
exceed
the

intend
scope
the
cftc
logic
violate
the
presumption
of
consistent
usage
under

act
the
cftc
may
determine

7
the
cftc
conclude
that
it
have
authority
to
ban
kalshiex
propose
political
event
contract
because
they
involve
game
as
kalshiex
correctly
argue
the
cftc
statutory
analysis
be
wrong
an
event
contract
involve
an
activity
only
if
the
underlying
event
constitute
that
activity
for
example
an
event
contract
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
if
the
event
underlie
the
event
contract
be
terrorism
assassination
or
war
the
cftc
however
do
not
assess
whether
the
event
underlie
kalshiex
contract
constitute
game
instead
the
cftc
assess
whether
the
act
of
trade
kalshiex
contract
would
be
game
that
reasoning
be
wrong
as
justice
scalia
explain
a
word
or
phrase
be
presume
to
bear
the

meaning
throughout

presumption

as

the
cftc

however

the
cftc
analysis
require
that
the
word

mean
one
thing
with
respect
to

iii
and
iv
contract
that
involve

and

a

if
the

in

under

cftc
read
a

the
cftc
interpretation
of
the

as
bear
two
totally

within

be
untenable
under
the
presumption

this

be
an

sufficient

and

even
if
the
cftc
be
correct
that
it
have
the
authority
to
regulate
gaming
it
would
still
lack
authority
to

because

indeed
it

if

the

all

the
contradiction
be
obvious
recognize
the
absurdity
of
this
position
the
cftc
suggest
that
its
decision
might
be
limit
to
prediction
market
for

because
an
election
be
a
type
of
contest
see
order
at

to
bet

on

be
to
stake
something

or
other
namely

at

to
take
a
position
in
the

contract
would
be
to
stake
something
of

upon
the

of

of

since
the
congressional

contract
be
premise
on
the

between
electoral

which
ultimately
determine
the

affiliation
of
the

and
the
pre

accord
to
the
cftc
limit
gaming
to
contest
would
draw
the
appropriate
line
because
future
contract
traditionally
have
not
be
premise
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of

at

this
reasoning
again
fail
and
be
also
dramatically
overbroad
even
if
an

campaign
might
in
some
sense
be
say
to
be

that

that

not
on
whether
the

the

moreover
a
substantial

characterize
the

of

process
as
equivalent

can
be

as

thus
if

and
the

offer
no

basis
upon
which
to
conclude
otherwise
then
no

any
market
could
be

logic
because
every

would

again
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
make
no
sense
because
it
would
negate
the
very
existence
of
the
market
that
the
statute
be
design
to
regulate
but
the
agency
provide
no
rational
basis
to
prevent
that
interpretation
from
be
apply
to

process
the
agency
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
be
thus
unreasonable
at
good
and
irrational
at
bad
the
state
statute
cite
by
the
cftc
also
fail
to
support
its
position
at
most
those
statute
show
that
the
word
gambling
can
refer
to
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
a
contest
which
in
context
be
something
similar
to
a

these
statute

not

that

and
certainly
do
not
show
that

whether

because
the

it

to
wring
this
line
from

an

will

will

statute
which
be
not

under
the

view
than
it

further
the
cftc
interpretation
of

would
appear
to
encompass
any
event

turn
on
the
outcome

process
that
involve
competition

could

because

the

the

that

diffuse

order

but
in
the
cftc
view
that
do
not
establish
that
the

can
be
use
for

identifiable
hedging
purpose
and
thus
do
not

this

a

financial

there

and

more

the
cftc
ignore
all
of
this
it
conclude
that
because

can
not
be

a
conclusion
that
be

must

the
cftc
state
in

that

have

by

that
the

contract
would
serve
as
a

the
cftc
also
seem
to
have
ignore
the
observation
that
if
a
person
seek
to
manipulate
election
outcome
manipulate
the
event
market
would
be
a
foolish
mechanism
by
which
to
achieve
that
result
first
off
trader
in
this
market
must
identify
themselves
to
intermediary
and
therefore
can
not
remain
hidden
manipulator
do
not
rationally
gravitate
to
market
that
mandate
this
level
of
transparency
second
contribute
to
dark
money
pool
that
can
purchase

and
engage
in
other
form
of
influence
would
likely
be
far
more
efficient
in
influence
outcome
than
attempt
to
influence
event
contract
price
third
market
can
be
self
correct
if
a
manipulator
try
to
inflate
the
price
of
a
democratic
or
republican
victory
the
manipulator
will
only
attract
trader
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
dark
money
contribution
have
no
equivalent
offset
mechanism
because
they
be
by
definition
hide
and
dark
and
do
not
operate
in
market
that
allow
for
the
formation
of
offset
position
the
risk
of
manipulation
be
thus
rationally
analyze
as
a
comparative
phenomenon
from
that
perspective
the
propose
contract
be
highly
unlikely
to
contribute
to
electoral
manipulation
precisely
because
of
the
existence
of
alternative
superior
method
of
manipulation
indeed
if
anything
the
self
correct
nature
of
the
contract
suggest
that
it
be
more
likely
to
have
an
antimanipulative
effect
the
cftc
show
no
sign
of
give
meaningful
consideration
to
any
of
these
noneconomic
benefit
affirm
that
reasoning
be
particularly
troubling
because
it
would
allow
the
agency
to
apply
that
approach
to
any
prediction
market
not
just
congressional
control
contract
the
court
should
not
allow
the
cftc
to
extinguish
base
on
incomplete
and
unexplained
reasoning
a
tool
of
great
potential
social
and
academic
value
the
order
fail
to
adequately
explain
its
concern
regard
manipulation
third
the
cftc
do
not
adequately
explain
its
conclusion
regard
the
risk
of
manipulation
as
professor
grundfest
and
other
commenter
explain
to
the
cftc
several
study
of
exist
prediction
market
have
show
that
price
pump
attempt
be
short
live
and
as
explain
above
discipline
by
the
market
self
correct
mechanism
moreover
the
relatively
low
position
limit
mean
any
one
participant
be
unlikely
to
be
able
to
move
the
market
in
a
meaningful
way
as
trader
enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
to
profit
from
the
mispricing
as
for
concern
about
manipulation
of
election
commenter
offer
abundant
empirical
and
theoretical
evidence
suggest
it
would
not
occur
of
course
the
cftc
as
an
expert
administrative
agency
be
free
to
review
the
evidence
and
make
a
predictive
judgment
as
to
the
risk
of
manipulation
but
it
give
no
sign
of
having
actually
make
such
a
predictive
judgment
the
cftc
observe
be
also
research
suggest
that
election
market
may
incentivize
the
creation
of
fake
or
unreliable
information
in
the
interest
of
move
the
market
and
a
number
of
commenter
also
raise
this
concern
order
at
22
but
there
also
be
research
show
that
election
market
would
decrease
misinformation
as
the
cftc
acknowledge
at
21
with
conflicting
evidence
in
the
record
the
cftc
must
show
its
work
it
do
not
instead
it
merely
note
the
existence
of
research
suggest
that
election
prediction
market
might
be
harmful
and
then
leapt
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
be
incumbent
on
the
cftc
to
grapple
with
the
conflict
evidence
in
the
record
and
give
a
reasoned
explanation
of
why
it
reach
its
conclusion
