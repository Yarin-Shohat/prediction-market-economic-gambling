of
three
million

with
the
500
in
april
1982
clayton
yeutter
be
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
he
be
a
former
assistant
secretary
of
agriculture
and
serve
as
deputy
special
trade
representative
during
the
ford
administration
for
the
first
full
year
be
more
than
eight
million
contract
clearly
stock
index
instrument
be
one
of
this
industry
all
time
success
story
I
think
it
might
be
helpful
today
if
I
be
to
describe
this
new
investment
tool
in
more
detail
and
tell
you
how
it
be
be
use
to
investment
risk
each
day
we
hear
report
of
other
future
exchange
around
the
world
who
plan
to
introduce
stock
index
future
here
in
europe
in
the
far
east
and
even
in
latin
america
though
these
propose
new
contract
be
destine
to
spread
stock
index
future
worldwide
I
must
confess
that
future
contract
be
probably
the
most
misunderstood
of
all
financial
instrument
the
stereotype
of
a
future
exchange
be
a
marketplace
where
only
speculation
occur
and
wild
eyed
gambler
drive
price
up
and
down
nothing
could
be
more
fallacious
future
market
do
not
create
risk
they
merely
transfer
it
from
investor
businessman
agricultural
producer
and
banker
to
professional
trader
who
be
willing
to
accept
that
risk
in
the
hope
of
make
substantial
profit
this
be
the
vital
economic
function
of
future
market
it
be
what
they
be
all
about
until
1972
this
transferral
of
risk
be
available
only
in
the
agricultural
sector
but
in
that
year
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
launch
the
era
of
financial
future
with
trading
in
the
international
currency
as
a
consequence
it
be
now
possible
to
transfer
interest
rate
risk
exchange
rate
risk
and
with
stock
index
future
stock
portfolio
risk
to
those
willing
to
accept
it
with
the
advent
of
enormous
stock
price
volatility
in
the
19706
the
vulnerability
of
institutional
portfolio
become
quite
apparent
to
investment
manager
this
make
the
500
especially
attractive
when
it
become
available
in
less
than
two
year
future
have
become
a
major
new
tool
in
equity
portfolio
management
the
marketplace
be
still
the
good
proving
ground
for
a
new
product
so
let
look
at
some
of
the
user
of
these
instrument
and
the
strategy
they
have
develop
several
large
corporate
pension
fund
include
exxon
and
westinghouse
electric
use
stock
index
future
as
hedging
vehicle
harvard
university
use
they
in
the
management
of
the
various
fund
it
control
the
university
have
find
that
it
can
reduce
the
market
risk
associate
with
large
endowment
and
increase
the
rate
of
return
on
its
investment
the
prudential
insurance
company
use
stock
index
future
in
the
management
of
the
prudential
bache
option
growth
fund
traveler
insurance
and
citibank
use
stock
index
future
to
assist
in
the
market
timing
of
their
investment
fund
let
walk
through
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
multinational
corporation
want
to
use
stock
index
future
to
hedge
its
stock
portfolio
let
we
say
that
the
corporation
have
a
two
million
dollar
diversified
portfolio
of
stock
that
correlate
closely
with
the
general
market
the
portfolio
manager
believe
the
market
may
be
vulnerable
to
a
decline
and
wish
to
protect
himself
without
have
to
sell
individual
security
when
the
500
index
be
price
at
he
decide
to
hedge
two
third
of
his
portfolio
by
sell
seventeen
500
future
contract
which
be
trade
at
when
the
index
then
fall
from
to
and
the
future
contract
fall
from
to
he
will
close
out
his
position
by
hedge
he
have
limit
the
decline
in
his
portfolio
value
to
percent
have
he
not
hedge
the
decline
would
have
be
percent
and
have
he
decide
to
hedge
his
entire
portfolio
instead
of
two
third
his
decline
would
have
be
totally
eliminate
in
fact
he
would
have
profit
by
of
course
there
be
a
number
of
other
strategy
that
can
be
develop
around
stock
index
future
for
example
they
can
be
use
to
shift
the
mix
of
an
equity
portfolio
they
can
be
employ
to
capture
a
risk
free
return
while
hold
on
to
equity
the
cme
marketing
department
constantly
hear
of
new
strategy
that
the
marketplace
have
devise
for
these
contract
remember
that
I
refer
early
to
the
popular
misconception
that
future
market
be
gamble
den
populate
only
by
speculator
now
obviously
the
speculator
be
a
very
important
part
of
the
market
without
the
speculator
whether
he
be
a
floor
trader
or
an
outside
customer
the
market
would
have
no
liquidity
without
liquidity
the
market
would
dry
up
and
disappear
so
the
speculator
be
important
but
when
you
consider
what
just
be
tell
you
about
large
institutional
use
of
our
market
and
the
investment
strategy
that
have
be
develop
you
realize
that
there
be
numerous
legitimate
hedging
application
for
future
market
typically
when
we
introduce
a
new
contract
the
market
be
first
use
by
block
trader
and
the
speculator
until
volume
build
to
a
certain
level
then
as
bank
corporation
portfolio
manager
investor
and
other
market
participant
learn
how
to
use
the
new
contract
the
hedger
come
in
only
then
do
a
market
take
off
the
way
the
500
have
off
for
example
obviously
we
see
a
bright
future
for
stock
index
product
500
future
could
soon
be
the
number
one
future
contract
in
our
industry
the
100
be
do
well
and
500
option
seem
ready
to
advance
to
high
trading
level
and
new
sub
index
will
permit
investor
a
much
wide
range
of
strategy
that
the
beauty
of
stock
index
product
as
we
launch
new
product
we
bring
new
business
to
all
the
other
member
of
the
index
and
option
if
one
look
at
the
number
of
potential
user
of
stock
index
future
the
necessary
conclusion
be
that
potential
growth
be
virtually
unlimited
some
study
indicate
that
there
be
about
person
who
actively
use
future
market
this
compare
to
about
35
million
person
who
hold
security
stock
index
obviously
be
a
revolutionary
new
product
that
will
continue
to
spur
growth
in
future
market
for
many
year
to
come
certainly
we
at
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
see
these
and
other
index
future
as
a
strong
factor
in
our
ongoing
plan
for
the
year
ahead
