question
about
they
question
as
always
the
commission
should
be
applaud
for
its
measured
and
deliberate
approach
to
consider
matter
like
the
contract
that
be
significant
to
the
development
and
growth
of
financial
market
as
a
firm
we
have
work
for
decade
to
assist
financial
institution
operate
company
and
investment
fund
with
all
manner
of
transactional
litigation
and
regulatory
matter
involve
the
derivative
market
this
experience
be
enhance
by
our
colleague
who
have
enjoy
the
privilege
of
serve
on
the
commission
staff
and
our
more
recent
experience
represent
fintech
company
we
greatly
respect
the
commission
as
an
institution
that
serve
the
public
interest
as
well
as
the
professional
staff
who
work
tirelessly
to
pursue
that
end
former
employee
of
all
three
branch
of
the
federal
government
be
well
represent
at
the
firm
so
we
can
appreciate
the
effort
it
require
for
the
commission
to
focus
on
specific
issue
like
this
one
give
the
heavy
workload
that
it
carry
in
effecting
congressional
rulemaking
mandate
while
seek
to
ensure
market
integrity
to
protect
customer
and
investor
and
to
enforce
the
law
in
case
where
it
may
have
be
violate
with
our
esteem
for
the
agency
in
mind
and
in
full
candor
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
commission
be
take
the
wrong
approach
to
evaluate
the
contract
in
the
follow
respect
it
be
wrong
to
review
the
contract
under
regulation
it
be
wrong
to
suggest
as
the
question
do
that
the
contract
must
be
show
to
have
an
economic
purpose
like
hedging
or
price
basing
before
they
can
be
approve
it
be
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
question
that
the
contract
be
themselves
some
type
of
gaming
it
be
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
question
that
the
contract
may
be
ill
suit
to
the
hedge
need
of
individual
and
that
other
derivative
contract
may
be
more
suitable
it
would
be
wrong
to
disapprove
the
contract
base
on
a
finding
that
they
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
address
these
point
below
while
also
offer
our
view
of
what
the
right
approach
would
be
in
each
case
it
be
wrong
to
review
the
contract
under
regulation
kalshi
submit
the
contract
for
review
and
approval
under
regulation
under
paragraph
b
of
that
regulation
the
commission
must
approve
a
new
product
unless
the
term
and
condition
of
the
product
violate
either
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
commission
regulation
the
contract
do
not
violate
the
law
or
the
rule
at
issue
which
mean
that
they
should
have
be
review
and
approve
within
either
the
45
day
allow
the
commission
by
regulation
or
an
extended
period
as
agree
by
the
commission
and
kalshi
under
regulation
accord
to
the
commission
letter
to
kalshi
on
august
26

however
the
contract
be
instead
be
review
under
regulation
on
the
basis
that
they
may
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
enumerate
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
the
activity
enumerate
in

terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
and
crime
something
illegal
as
we
explain
below
the
contract
involve
relate
to
or

none
of
these
thing
instead
the
commission
should
consider
the
contract
under
regulation
which
be
the
provision
under
which
kalshi
submit
they
this
view
be
first
publicly
articulate
as
to
the
contract
in
commissioner
pham
dissent
to
the
commission
decision
to
review
the
contract

can

that
test
be
not

at
any
point
in

the
commission
do
not
have
statutory
authority
to

such
a
test

we
have
find
that
at
most

of

and
part
38
of
the
commission

impose
an
economic

requirement
on

that
the
market
list
of
trade
the
commission
have
decide
to
evaluate
the
contract
under
section
as
a
type
of
gaming
contract
and
therefore
it
be
proceed
to
review
the
contract
for
approval
under

even
under
those
two
provision
no
requirement
for
establish
a

economic

can
be
find
section
provide
that
the

may
determine
that

on

be
contrary

similarly
regulation
prohibit
a

entity
like
a
designate

market
from
for
trading
or
for
clear
a
contract
that
reference
an
activity
similar
to

if
the
commission
determine
that
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
public
interest
be
not
the
same
thing
as
an
economic
purpose
and
the
commission
have
not
elsewhere
suggest
that
they
be
equivalent
indeed
the
question
treat
the
concept
of
economic
purpose
and
public
interest
separately
compare
question

economic
purpose
to
question

public
interest
instead
the
commission
should
determine
whether
the
contract
meet
the
requirement
state
in
the
plain
statutory
and
rule
text
of
the
relevant
authorize
provision
as
explain
early
we
think
those
provision
be
section
and
commission
regulation
it
be
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
question
that
the
contract
be
themselves
some
type
of
gaming
do
so
conflate
an
enumerate
event
with
the
contract
themselves
which
be
binary
option
that
be
the
contact
could
only
fall
within
the
ambit
of
section
and
regulation
if
the
commission
premise
be
that
the
contract
themselves
rather
than
the
event
that
they
reference
constitute
game
the
contract
do
not
reference
an
event
of
terrorism
assassination
or
war
nor
do
they
involve
anything
that
be
illegal
under
federal
or
state
law
election
be
plainly
lawful
for
the
commission
premise
to
be
valid
then
it
would
also
have
to
be
possible
for
there
to
be
contract
that
itself
would
be
an
event
of
terrorism
assassination
war
or
crime
that
would
be
a
total
non
sequitur
if
that
be
not
the
commission
premise
on
this
reading
then
the
commission
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
any
contract
reference
a
type
of
event
enumerate
in
section
would
be
game
this
would
mean
that
a
contract
on
an
event
of
terrorism
assassination
war
or
crime
would
be
a
form
of
game
too
set
aside
the
propriety
of
such
a
thing
if
the
statute
be
to
be
read
this
way
do
so
would
make
the
enumerate
category
other
than
game
superfluous
that
be
the
statute
could
accomplish
the
goal
of
prohibit
gaming
simply
by
prohibit
game
full
stop
take
section
to
mean
that
all
reference
contract
be
game
contract
would
be
wrong
however
it
be
canonical
that
each
word
in
a
statute
must
be
give
separate
effect
there
be
nothing
in
the
statutory
text
that
treat
game
differently
from
the
other
enumerate
event
type
a
contract
on
war
would
be
prohibit
just
the
same
as
a
contract
on
gaming
would
be
prohibit
for
example
a
contract
do
not
become
game
because
of
what
it
reference
to
hold
so
would
be
contrary
to
what
the
statute
and
the
rule
both
say
the
commission
must
apply
the
commodity
exchange
act
as
it
be
write
by
congress
and
pass
into
law
in
this
regard
other

give

I
emphasis
add
instead
and
if
it
be
to
proceed
under

the
commission
should
review
whether
the

underlie
the

whether

or
more
abstruse
for
this
reason
we
do
not
attempt
to
suggest
to
the
commission
what
the
right
definition
of
gaming
should
be
do
so
would
be
beside
the
point
it
be

in

to

of

and
that

that

only
if
it
be

for

in
addition
the
question
that
ask
about
the
potential

of

be
irrelevant
under
the
standard
that
the
commission
be
direct
to
apply
by
section
that
subject
be
outside
the
scope
of
section
and
as
we
explain
in
the
next
section
the
public
interest
language
in
section
and
regulation
do
not
admit
for
any
consideration
of
campaign
finance
law
beyond
perhaps
an
event
that
violate
campaign
finance
law
illegal
conduct
a
campaign
finance
violation
be
different
than
an

outcome
it
would
be
wrong
to
disapprove
the
contract
base
on
a
finding
that
they
be
contrary
to
the
public

the
public
interest
be
relevant

commission
review
under

in
three
way
none
of
which
be
germane
to
the
contract
first
clause
of

state
that
the
commission
may
determine
a
contract
be
contrary
to

if
it
involve
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or

plainly
an

not
any
of
those

second

of

may

that

an
activity
that

that
the

determine

to

emphasis
add
while
the
commission
may
be
incline
to
think
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the

interest
its
ability
to
disapprove
they
become
operative
only
if
it
determine
that
election
be
event
similar
to
those
enumerate
early
in
the
regulation
we
doubt
the
commission
would
be
able
to
make
such
a
determination
on
any
realistic
set
of
fact
o
instead
the
commission
would
have
to
consider
the
reference
to
public
interest
in
paragraph
of
regulation
as
a
freestande
power
to
reject
any
contract
that
it
determine
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
would
make
a
cannon
of
a
rifle
an
agency
must
not
read
into
a
rule
a
broad
power
than
exist
in
the
authorize
statutory
language
the
public
interest
power
reserve
to
the
commission
in
section
only
extend
to
activity
similar
to
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
crime
go
beyond
that
with
the
rule
would
be
go
beyond
what
the
law
allow
this
may
well
be
why
the
question
conflate
the
contract
with
game
itself
because
to
read
the
statute
as
write
would
mean
the
contract
be
permissible
under
section
and
regulation
instead
the
commission
should
approve
the
contract
under
section
and
regulation
which
impose
no
public
interest
requirement
the
same
result
would
be
reach
even
if
the
commission
be
to
proceed
under
section
and
regulation
and
in
do
so
apply
public
interest
as
it
be
use
in
those
provision
we
greatly
appreciate
the
care
and
attention
that
the
commission
have
give
to
the
contract
they
be
indeed
of
great
significance
to
the
development
and
growth
of
financial
market
so
we
thank
the
commissioner
and
the
professional
staff
of
the
commission
for
the
time
that
they
be
continue
to
dedicate
to
they
while
we
applaud
those
effort
we
disagree
with
the
approach
be
take
we
think
the
commission
be
fundamentally
mistake
to
evaluate
the
contract
as
if
they
involve
reference
or
relate
to
game
they
simply
do
not
we
thank
the
commission
once
more
for
undertake
a
deliberate
public
process
with
regard
to
the
contract
we
