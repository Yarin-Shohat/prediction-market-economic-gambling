kalshiex
propose
congressional
control
contract
under
cftc
regulation
my
name
be
tim
mcdermott
while
I
currently
the
ceo
of
teraexchange
a
swap
execution
facility
currently
apply
for
commission
registration
I
also
have
be
a
public
director
of
kalshi
since
2020
and
it
be
in
that
capacity
in
which
I
be
submit
this
comment
prior
to
these
position
I
hold
a
variety
of
role
at
nadex
between
2008
and
2019
include
as
ceo
general
counsel
and
as
a
board
member
and
then
even
early
with
compliance
at
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
more
than
ten
year
ago
I
be
a
critical
part
of
nadex
engagement
with
the
cftc
regard
its
effort
to
list
political
event
contract
that
commission
in
my
view
make
the
wrong
decision
and
I
believe
the
event
of
the
last
decade
confirm
that
the
current
commission
should
take
a
different
approach
kalshi
contract
be
compliant
with
the
law
and
very
clearly
would
provide
a
large
amount
of
social
value
in
the
form
of
hedge
price
basing
and
forecasting
below
I
address
the
cftc
seventeen
question
in
detail
throughout
these
question
there
appear
to
be
a
persistent
theme
whether
the
commission
should
impose
new
burden
of
proof
on
political
event
market
that
be
not
find
in
the
law
regulation
rule
or
commission
precedent
some
of
the
question
ask
seem
to
extend
even
beyond
the
review
conduct
by
the
commission
during
the
consideration
of
nadex
political
event
contract
and
more
recently
the
erisx
rsbix
future
1
do
these
contract
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
describe
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
be
similar
to
gaming
as
describe
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
no
the
contract
do
not
involve
relate
to
or
refer
to
gaming
neither
on
their
face
nor
tangentially
they
relate
to
a
federal
political
procedure
use
to
determine
leadership
in
each
chamber
of
the
united
states
congress
a
standard
political
procedure
with
clear
economic
consequence
there
be
no
definition
of
gaming
find
in
the
cea
or
the
regulation
or
rule
thereunder
however
the
commission
do
find
in
the
nadex
order
that
election
trading
constitute
game
because
of
the
way
that
some
state
law
define
gambling
or
wagering
which
it
find
to
be
identical
to
the
trading
of
an
event
contract
this
decision
be
I
believe
inconsistent
with
the
cea
and
the
commission
should
take
this
opportunity
to
correct
the
record
1
one
can
not
equate
event
contract
that
turn
on
the
partisan
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
pro
tempore
with
gambling
prohibit
by
some
state
this
would
be
wrong
for
several
major
reason
a
the
contract
do
not
involve
game
if
a
contract
be
to
ask
what
will
the
number
of
the
powerball
lottery
be
or
will
the
die
land
on
seven
those
would
involve
gaming
to
say
that
kalshi
contract
involve
gaming
because
trade
the
contract
be
gaming
would
be
a
misread
of
the
statute
if
the
commission
be
to
take
this
position
it
would
put
event
contract
themselves
into
serious
jeopardy
since
many
state
prohibit
gambling
on
all
future
event
and
for
that
matter
take
a
position
on
the
future
price
of
security
and
commodity
this
would
have
to
mean
that
all
such
event
contract
trigger
the
gaming
prong
this
be
a
point
make
persuasively
by
commissioner
quintenz
statement
on
erisx
rsbix
nfl
future
which
I
will
return
to
to
this
end
the
2012
nadex
order
should
not
stand
and
the
commission
should
clarify
that
state
gambling
law
do
not
force
event
contract
by
their
very
nature
to
trigger
unlawful
activity
provision
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
be
a
plain
misinterpretation
of
the
relevant
provision
of
the
cea
I
the
relevant
portion
of
the
cea
note
that
the
commission
may
prohibit
contract
which
involve
I
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
be
refer
to
the
activity
reference
which
in
this
case
be
a
plainly
legal
activity
the
election
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
president
pro
tempore
this
be
true
for
all
election
contract
election
be
not
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
ii
the
interpretation
lay
out
in
the
nadex
order
require
one
to
conclude
that
congress
be
define
the
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
portion
differently
than
the
other
enumerate
activity
which
would
not
follow
since
the
contract
can
not
itself
constitute
terrorism
assassination
or
war
to
say
that
the
commission
ought
to
consider
whether
the
contract
itself
involve
unlawful
activity
because
trading
on
the
contract
be
unlawful
activity
which
it
be
not
be
not
in
or
imply
by
the
text
or
to
my
knowledge
congressional
discussion
of
the
law
b
there
be
qualitative
difference
between
an
event
contract
trade
on
a
cftc
registrant
and
the
kind
of
wager
these
law
refer
to
these
wager
law
patently
do
not
refer
to
a
cftc
trade
contract
give
their
ratification
well
before
the
commission
existence
and
their
irrelevance
as
the
cfma
actively
preempt
any
state
gambling
provision
as
commissioner
quintenz
write
in
his
erisx
statement
I
whereas
bettor
participate
in
game
of
pure
chance
whose
sole
purpose
be
to
completely
reward
the
winner
and
punish
the
loser
for
an
outcome
that
would
otherwise
provide
no
economic
utility
think
roulette
speculator
in
the
derivative
market
participate
in
non
chance
drive
outcome
that
have
price
form
impact
upon
which
legitimate
business
can
hedge
their
activity
and
cash
flow
c
moreover
if
this
be
the
case
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
include
gaming
in
the
relevant
portion
of
the
cea
since
these
law
refer
to
unlawful
activity
it
would
be
superfluous
to
include
an
additional
provision
target
gaming
commissioner
quintenz
argue
as
much
in
his
erisx
statement
I
if
the
statute
assume
that
participate
in
any
event
contract
involve
make
a
wager
or
gamble
there
would
have
be
no
need
for
congress
to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contract
upon
which
the
commission
could
make
a
public
interest
determination
2
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
whether
take
a
position
on
election
or
congressional
control
be
define
as
game
under
state
or
federal
law
no
instead
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
contract
have
hedge
utility
price
base
utility
and
economic
purpose
as
it
consider
in
the
nadex
decision
and
in
its
erisx
decision
as
note
above
the
commission
would
be
confuse
trading
in
the
contract
with
the
underlie
activity
of
the
event
contract
the
commission
should
also
not
apply
a
novel
standard
to
determine
what
constitutes
game
that
be
say
this
contract
be
not
available
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
I
understand
that
similar
contract
be
available
on
some
offshore
or
unregulated
platform
but
that
fact
actually
mitigate
in
favor
of
approval
of
the
kalshi
contract
a
regulated
market
should
be
available
to
provide
the
datum
and
hedge
or
speculate
opportunity
that
so
many
user
clearly
seek
the
existence
of
willing
speculator
say
nothing
about
a
market
hedge
price
base
utility
or
economic
purpose
speculator
play
a
willing
role
give
the
enormous
public
interest
in
political
outcome
and
the
extensive
modeling
and
discussion
of
such
outcome
in
the
public
sphere
because
of
their
great
import
it
seem
very
normal
to
expect
some
off
exchange
activity
especially
in
the
absence
of
an
on
exchange
alternative
3
do
these
contract
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
as
describe
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
no
the
only
activity
reference
in
the
contract
be
the
party
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
senate
president
pro
tempore
the
commission
should
also
not
consider
state
law
prohibit
bet
or
wager
on
the
outcome
of
election
in
this
context
for
many
of
the
reason
discuss
above
why
the
same
law
should
not
trigger
the
gaming
prong
although
there
be
other
reason
too
1
kalshi

do
not
involve

be
no
involvement
relation

to

or

2
kalshi

be
not

election

under

and
thus
do
not
involve
unlawful
activity
the
cfma
explicitly
provide
the
cftc
with
preemptive

over

gambling
law
thus
as
long
as
the
contract
be
certify

and
not
stop
by
the
commission
the
contract
be
lawful
there
be
no
situation
where
kalshi
offer
the

would
be
unlawful
because
of

gambling
provision
a
if
the
commission

take
the

not

and
for
that
matter
wager
on

commodity
this
would
imply
that
all
such
contract
event
contract
and
future
trigger
unlawful
under

provision
I
to

be
the

substantively
different
than

previously
propose
contract
such
that

analysis
should
be
different
for
reference
please
see
cftc
order
prohibit
north
american
derivative
exchange
political
event
derivative
contract
2
2012
available
at
as
the
former
chief
executive
officer
of
nadex
I
have
deep
experience
with
those
propose
contract
there
be
several
major
distinction
between
nadex
event
contract
and
these
1
the
position
limit
be
ten
time
low
kalshi
be
whereas
nadex
propose
limit
while
I
believe
that
the
level
propose
by
nadex
be
and
would
still
be
appropriate
I
note
that
the
commission
have
accept
election
market
social
value
conditional
on
low
position
limit
in
the
case
of
iowa
electronic
market
and
predictit
kalshi
market
be
an
additional
step
in
that
direction
to
promote
liquidity
and
accurate
pricing
simultaneously
address
commission
concern
but
also
provide
value
for
market
participant
2
circumstance
since
the
nadex
order
have
change
materially
this
be
an
important
point
for
the
commission
to
consider
the
cftc
have
permit
new
product
over
time
as
circumstance
change
such
as
the
first
cash
settle
index
future
in
the
1970
and
the
first
bitcoin
binary
option
in
2015
and
bitcoin
future
in
2017
the
currently
relevant
change
circumstance
include
a
the
no
action
letter
for
predictit
from
2014
predictit
trade
more
than
billion
contract
in
its
time
without
as
far
as
I
be
aware
any
concern
from
state
regard
possible
violation
of
their
law
or
regard
election
integrity
hundred
of
million
be
trade
on
the
2020
election
by
american
trader
it
appear
the
commission
recognize
there
be
some
social
value
in
election
trading
in
issue
the
predictit
no
action
letter
it
even
permit
increase
position
limit
from
iowa
electronic
market
level
thus
even
the
commission
seem
to
have
acknowledge
in
the
recent
past
that
with
some
position
limit
the
benefit
of
election
trading
outweigh
the
harm
kalshi
proposal
be
the
next
step
in
that
thinking
as
state
above
b
new
unregulated
decentralized
exchange
use
blockchain
technology
the
commission
do
not
have
the
resource
and
in
some
case
not
even
the
mean
to
shut
down
these
exchange
design
to
evade
government
regulation
as
detail
by
the
technology
advisory
committee
in
its
december
2020
meeting
in
order
to
drive
liquidity
away
from
these
exchange
and
protect
consumer
the
commission
should
champion
the
opportunity
to
kill
two
bird
with
one
stone
bring
activity
under
cftc
and
american
oversight
while
simultaneously
take
the
wind
out
of
the
sail
of
unregulated
exchange
and
reduce
the
burden
on
enforcement
c
the
growth
of
election
trading
in
general
in
addition
to
predictit
and
new
decentralized
exchange
offshore
platform
like
betfair
have
see
record
volume
every
election
cycle
this
be
a
problem
that
be
grow
not
go
away
the
commission
should
not
wait
10
year
to
return
to
this
problem
when
it
clear
that
this
activity
should
be
under
its
oversight
it
should
be
proactive
not
reactive
I
individual
at
the
end
of
the
day
have
incredibly
large
exposure
to
election
risk
as
that
risk
and
the
public
awareness
of
that
risk
increase
and
as
the
economy
become
more
specialized
expect
legitimate
hedging
and
price
basing
interest
to
continue
to
grow
the
commission
should
not
risk
kick
the
can
down
the
road
until
another
set
of
staff
and
commissioner
have
to
deal
with
this
problem
it
be
truly
ii
in
the
interest
of
the
cftc
and
the
public
to
address
this
problem
now
by
make
reasonable
attempt
to
bring
the
activity
under
a
legal
registrant
with
constraint
as
kalshi
have
propose
if
the
cftc
have
idea
for
other
reasonable
control
it
should
allow
these
contract
to
be
list
and
work
proactively
with
kalshi
on
those
idea
d
the
increase
awareness
of
risk
cause
by
election
compare
to
the
there
seem
to
be
even
more
financial
and
academic
discussion
regard
the
impact
that
election
probability
have
on
financial

even
before
the

occur
investment
bank
regularly
publish
public

and
report
to

on
the

they
face

how
to

do

the

for

on
that

please
provide
tangible
example
of
commercial

that
can
be

directly
by
the

economic
analysis
that
demonstrate
the
hedge

of
the

1
yes
these
contract
can
serve
a
hedging
function
political
control
be
something
that
have
massive
economic
consequence
throughout
all
industry
and
the
macroeconomy
broadly
2
yes
these
contract
be
predictable
enough
in
order
to
assess
this
question
example
of
how
election
pose
risk
and
how
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
be
very
useful
and
very
telling
but
perhaps
even
more
telling
be
the
amount
of
hedging
that
be
currently
ongoing
in
the
market
base
on
my
personal
experience
bank
and
other
financial
advisor
frequently
advise
client
and
the
public
on
the
risk
that
come
directly
from
election
the
price
of
financial
asset
regularly
move
because
of
election
outcome
as
report
on
in
the
financial
press
for
example
here
this
have
also
be
repeatedly
verify
by
economist
and
social
science
although
policy
be
enact
well
after
election
themselves
take
place
expectation
about
policy
change
be
impute
into
the
price
of
asset
immediately
if
the
market
be
already
price
asset
and
hedge
election
risk
the
commission
be
not
in
a
position
to
conclude
the
opposite
a
however
I
should
note
that
predictable
enough
be
not
a
standard
find
in
the
law
or
regulation
or
even
the
economic
purpose
test
b
predictable
enough
be
also
a
standard
that
would
fail
to
comport
with
how
hedging
work
hedge
be
not
necessarily
a
direct
dollar
for
dollar
offset
of
the
future
change
in
the
value
of
an
asset
one
hold
for
example
a
weather
contract
common
to
exchange
like
cme
cantor
fitzgerald
and
kalshi
address
uncertain
risk
a
hurricane
could
cause
significant
damage
power
outage
or
no
damage
at
all
to
the
hedger
in
the
same
vein
although
the
economic
impact
of
an
election
outcome
on
asset
and
cash
flow
be
not
certain
they
be
real
real
enough
that
the
market
already
engage
in
hedging
and
price
base
behavior
base
off
these
risk
clearly
qualify
for
risk
mitigation
product
offer
by
a
commission
regulated
exchange
7
be
there
unique
economic
risk
tie
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedge
via
derivative
product
on
equity
debt
interest
rate
tax
rate
asset
value
and
other
commodity
price
yes
an
example
of
this
be
a
firm
or
household
which
depend
on
government
subsidy
or
benefit
which
another
party
have
commit
to
either
give
or
take
away
should
it
be
elect
there
be
no
other
mechanism
for
such
a
firm
or
household
to
hedge
such
risk
if
derivative
product
for
the
firm
in
question
do
exist
then
there
be
no
mechanism
by
which
to
do
this
I
will
also
note
that
political
control
contract
in
as
much
as
this
could
happen
could
be
a
far
superior
hedge
than
the
alternative
describe
in
this
question
1
market
participant
especially
less
sophisticated
investor
may
not
be
able
to
determine
whether
the
specific
event
risk
already
have
be
price
into
the
relevant
product
participant
may
try
to
hedge
use
these
but
the
risk
have
already
be
price
in
result
in
zero
value
for
the
would
be
hedger
this
be
a
value
add
of
kalshi
propose
contractprice
discovery
for
the
public
2
these
product
carry
risk
other
than
political
control
risk
thus
hedge
may
not
be
effective
for
this
purpose
if
other
risk
destroy
the
value
of
the
hedge
however
I
do
appreciate
that
this
question
acknowledge
that
these
risk
be
inputte
into
the
price
of
other
derivative
product
the
price
basing
case
for
these
contract
be
incredibly
strong
any
trader
will
acknowledge
that
who
hold
control
of
the
senate
and
house
matter
deeply
for
oil
and
pharma
stock
among
many
other
as
commissioner
berkovitz
write
in
his
erisx
statement
price
basing
be
an
equivalent
justification
for
these
product
as
hedge
far
the
question
fail
to
appreciate
the
value
of
diverse
opportunity
in
our
market
there
be
nothing
in
the
cea
that
say
one
contract
per
risk
the
question
seem
to
suggest
that
if
there
be
other
contract
that
can
hedge
specific
risk
then
this
contract
will
not
likely
be
use
for
hedge
this
too
be
inconsistent
with
the
cea
what
contract
market
participant
utilize
be
for
each
participant
to
decide
it
would
be
wrong
for
the
commission
to
attempt
to
pick
a
winner
in
term
of
which
contract
market
participant
should
be
allow
to
use
to
accomplish
their
goal
or
about
how
specific
contract
will
be
use
potentially
in
concert
with
those
other
available
market
tool
8
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
in
review
the
contact
hedging
function
be
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
use
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrate
need
by
likely
hedger
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
use
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participant
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedge
use
the
commission
should
use
the
economic
purpose
test
that
be
refer
to
in
both
nadex
and
contract
that
have
hedge
price
base
utility
because
the
contract
refer
to
an
economic
event
should
be
permit
on
designate
contract
market
to
my
knowledge
the
commission
have
never
require
that
a
registrant
actually
provide
evidence
of
a
hedger
use
their
platform
for
a
new
contract
under
review
nor
could
the
registrant
since
the
contract
be
not
live
it
contrary
to
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
have
previously
use
create
a
new
standard
that
suggest
there
must
be
preliste
proof
of
a
sufficient
number
of
hedger
compare
to
speculator
and
other
would
be
arbitrary
have
not
be
require
in
the
past
and
be
not
part
of
the
cea
or
the
rule
or
regulation
thereunder
far
the
imply
framework
would
be
unworkable
and
have
a
chilling
effect
on
all
innovation
in
this
space
if
not
completely
kill
it
the
imply
framework
would
require
an
exchange
that
be
look
to
bring
an
innovative
product
to
market
to
create
and
demonstrate
the
hedge
demand
for
a
particular
product
before
it
even
trade
that
completely
misapprehend
the
reality
of
the
marketplace
and
all
but
guarantee
that
no
innovation
will
occur
9
should
the
commission
consider
contract
and

and
the

base
to

do
whether

affect
this
analysis
1
the
commission
should
not
be
determine
whether
a
product
be
likely
to
be
use
for
hedge
that
be
not
a
standard
include
or
imply
in
the
cea
there
be
also
serious
concern
about
the
commission
or
indeed
anyone
ability
to
read
the
tea
leaf
to
determine
with
great
certainty
what
the
market
will
be
for
a
certain
product
that
be
antithetical
to
the
cea
approach
that
the
market
should
decide
indeed
how
many
contract
have
experience
exchange
launch
with
great
fanfare
and
hope
over
the
year
only
to
see
they
reject
by
the
marketplace
2
the
commission
should
not
consider
contract
and
position
size
and
the
exchange
intend
customer
base
to
assess
the
product
hedge
utility
a
such
a
standard
would
be
flawed
since
any
exchange
user
base
can
be
fluid
over
time
and
moreover
the
user
base
of
this
contract
be
not
yet
available
to
the
commission
to
know
since
it
be
not
list
to
say
that
kalshi
trader
be
primarily
retail
trader
say
nothing
of
the
hedge
value
of
this
contract
in
particular
b
the
standard
that
the
commission
have
previously
use
in
this
regard
be
economic
purpose
in
the
form
of
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
the
fact
that
speculation
may
exist
be
completely
irrelevant
to
the
question
in
front
of
the
commission
3
the
contract
have
a
size
of
1
in
order
to
make
itself
readily
available
to
retail
customer
along
with
a
position
limit
low
position
limit
on
other

like
cme
micro
future
be
very
normal
retail
trader
as
well
as
small
and
medium
sized
business
who
benefit
from
these
position
limit
the
commission
must
remember
do
have
significant
risk
from
election
they
be
affect
deeply
by
government
policy
just
as
much
as
big
business
be
however
they
be
unable
to
mitigate
that
same
risk
a
position
limit
be
not
static
and
can
change
kalshi
entrance
into
the
event
contract
space
begin
and
have
remain
with
low
position
limit
compare
to
traditional
commodity
future
exchange
however
that
could
change
for
any
contract
pende
new
information
about
the
market
and
the
need
of
actor
seek
to
hedge
in
the
space
this
point
demonstrate
why
actual
predict
use
be
not
an
appropriate
standard
in
this
context
it
would
not
allow
for
change
and
responsible
innovation
that
should
be
expect
of
any
4
whether
the
contract
be
margine
or
fully
collateralized
may
affect
this
analysis
but
kalshi
do
not
offer
margined
trading
so
this
would
appear
to
be
a
moot
point
at
this
time
it
should
not
consider
this
but
could
at
a
later
date
10
should
the
commission
consider
the
contract
design
and
payout
when
try
to
assess
the
economic
utility
of
the
contract
for
example
be
binary
contract
useful
for
hedge
nonbinary
economic
event
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
contract
can
be
use
to
hedge
or
be
use
as
a
basis
for
price
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
the
question
be
not
if
they
will
be
use
for
hedging
or
price
basing
nor
be
it
if
this
be
the
only
way
to
hedge
or
the
only
information
that
will
go
into
a
price
the
thing
that
the
commission
should
look
at
be
whether
the
contract
could
be
use
for
hedging
or
as
a
basis
in
price
the
commission
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
market
and
the
commission
should
not
try
to
predict
the
future
development
of
a
contract
additionally
the
example
offer
in
the
question
be
not
relevant
to
the
contract
here
the
event
in
question
be
binary
either
a
party
will
or
will
not
control
the
chamber
of
congress
this
be
a
very
natural
fit
for
that
risk
accord
to
market
participant
and
it
be
how
risk
be
discuss
among
those
involve
although
that
event
have
myriad
economic
impact
in
many
industry
that
be
the
case
with
all
event
contract
as
well
as
future
11
do
the
contract
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
price
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
yes
the
price
of
financial
asset
regularly
move
because
of
election
outcome
as
report
on
in
the
financial
press
this
have
also
be
repeatedly
and
widely

and
social

in
addition

12
be
the
propose
contract
contrary
to
the
public
interest
why
or
why
not
as
note
the
cea
make
this
question
relevant
only
to
contract
whose
underlie
activity
be
enumerate
in
section
because
the
activity
underlie
the
contract
at
issue
be
not
enumerate
there
the
question
be
not
relevant
here
insofar
as
the
nadex
order
conclude
the
nadex
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
I
disagree
with
that
analysis
I
believe
that
this
commission
should
not
find
that
the
kalshi
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
indeed
the
contract
be
strongly
in
the
public
interest
in
addition
to
their
hedge
utility
and
price
basing
utility
the
forecasting
datum
generate
by
these
contract
be
enormous
and
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
have
this
forecasting
datum
the
value
create
by
firm
try
to
model
election
outcome
to
the
public
such
as
the
new
york
times
the
economist
and
fivethirtyeight
extensive
americans
have
an
extremely
large
interest
in
this
probability
a
forecast
create
by
the
market
can
outperform
traditional
polling
and
other
forecasting
method
give
the
public
an
enormous
social
service
in
the
nadex
order
the
commission
worry
that
the
contract
would
create
perverse
incentive
to
vote
switch
in
order
to
improve
the
odd
of
their
contract
pay
out
in
my
opinion
this
be
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
conclude
that
the
nadex
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
reasoning
would
be
even
less
persuasive
with
respect
to
kalshi
contract
give
the
change
circumstance
and
contract
since
the
nadex
order
1
the
suggestion
that
market
participant
would
be
incentivize
to
switch
vote
be
speculative
in
fact
experience
from
history
and
foreign
nation
suggest
that
any
such
concern
regard
this
issue
be
without
foundation
because
of
the
prevalence
of
election
trading
abroad
in
the
united
kingdom
in
ireland
australia
and
other
liberal
democraciesand
here
in
the
united
states
over
the
past
30
year
iem
intrade
predictit
etc
I
believe
the
commission
would
really
need
to
provide
some
empirical
evidence
of
such
activity
before
raise
this
concern
with
respect
to
these
contract
2
the
creation
of
predictit
in
2014
the
commission
clearly
believe
despite
the
then
recent
nadex
order
that
with
some
position
limit
these
contract
be
socially
valuable
this
be
merely
the
next
step
in
that
evolution
if
the
commission
believe
a
different
position
limit
be
appropriate
it
should
engage
kalshi
on
that
basis
3
these
contract
be
trade
enormous
amount
already
in
addition
to
the
large
stake
that
individual
already
have
in
election
outcome
independent
of
exchange
proper
however
the
concern
regard
manipulation
and
election
integrity
express
at
other
point
throughout
these
question
be
all
the
bad
on
unregulated
platform
that
lack
know
yourcustomer
authorization
position
limit
surveillance
compliance
with
the
core
principle
and
commission
oversight
in
order
to
promote
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
encourage
the
listing
of
these
contract
on
a
regulated
dcm
like
kalshi
13
could
the
trading
of
these
or
other
political
control
or
election
base
contract
affect
the
integrity
of
election
or
election
within
the
chamber
of
congress
could
it
affect
the
perception
of
the
integrity
of
election
within
the
chamber
of
congress
no
1
the
party
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
pro
tempore
be
well
know
before
the
actual
event
take
place
because
it
be
determine
in
practice
by
look
at
which
party
hold
the
most
seat
in
the
relevant
chamber
the
trading
of
the
propose
contract
would
not
affect
that
practice
individual
candidate
be
not
relevant
for
kalshi
contract
only
the
party
and
that
be
already
determine
by
the
time
the
house
and
senate
be
elect
the
speaker
and
president
pro
tempore
2
the
rule
of
the
contract
will
preclude
member
of
congress
from
trade
these
contract
and
member
have
their
own
obligation
to
avoid
conflict
of
interest
and
be
require
to
go
through
extensive
financial
reporting
that
can
reveal
such
conflict
of
interest
3
these
contract
be
already
trade
on
in
large
volume
and
they
be
critically
grow
the
commission
should
make
sure
that
activity
be
happen
under
its
oversight
and
with
the
full
protection
that
be
a
registrant
provide
accordingly
to
the
extent
that
the
kalshi
contract
have
any
impact
with
respect
to
election
integrity
and
public
perception
it
will
be
to
increase
confidence
not
decrease
it
14
could
the
contract
facilitate
violation
of
or
otherwise
undermine
federal
campaign
finance
law
or
regulation
for
example
could
the
contract
make
it
easy
to
sidestep
prohibition
govern
coordination
between
candidate
campaign
committee
and
political
action
committee
no
candidly
I
do
not
really
understand
this
question
the
kalshi
contract
change
neither
the
incentive
of
a
candidate
and
a
pac
to
coordinate
nor
the
mean
for
they
to
do
so
these
market
be
merely
an
informational
and
hedge
tool
not
something
that
could
increase
coordination
between
those
two

the

special
consideration
with

requirement
for
example
could
candidate
campaign
committee
or
political
action
committee
manipulate
the
contract
by
trade
on
internal
non
public
polling
datum
kalshi
contract
do
not
present
any
special
consideration
in
this
regard
rather
these
contract
present
standard
consideration
that
kalshi
have
address
through
its
own
rule
against
manipulation
and
its
prohibition
against
politically
expose
person
their
family
and
close
associate
from
trade
on

contract
16
should
campaign

committee
candidate
for
the
house
and
senate
and
other
entity
involve
in

and
expenditure
or
likely
to
hold
non
public
information
or
subject
to
federal
election
commission
oversight
be
prohibit
from
participate
in
the
contract
would
such
a
prohibition
help
address
federal
campaign
law
or
manipulation
and
surveillance
concern
how
would
such
restriction
impact
the
commission
determination
of
whether
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
kalshi
have
protection
against
manipulation
and
actively
prohibit
politically
expose
person
their
family
and
close
associate
from
trade
on
political
contract
include
this
I
would
suggest
however
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
contract
no
pac
candidate
or
campaign
committee
likely
hold
meaningful
information
or
influence
on
the
outcome
of
all
the
house
and
senate
election
that
lead
to
control
of
congress
that
would
require
prohibition
additional
to
what
kalshi
have
impose
any
such
concern
however
should
not
impact
the
commission
determination
of
whether
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
state
above
17
what
other
factor
should
the
commission
consider
in
determine
whether
these
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
ought
to
consider
the
contract
hedge
utility

utility
forecasting
value
to
the
public
and
ability
to
bring
unregistered

to

the

on
