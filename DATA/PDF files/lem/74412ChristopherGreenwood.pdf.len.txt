regard
the
kalshiex
propose
congressional
control
contract
22
002
to
whom
it
may
concern
there
have
be
a
wide
range
of
comment
write
from
academic
financial
and
small
business
point
of
view
many
of
which
I
would
echo
it
be
self
evident
that
this
contract
on
congressional
control
can
and
will
be
use
for
hedge
in
various
industry
profession
that
be
sensitive
to
swing
in
political
sentiment
it
be
self
evident
that
this
market
would
serve
a
useful
economic
function
and
that
the
information
from
this
market
be
in
the
public
interest
I
therefore
think
that
this
market
should
be
approve
instead
of
rewrite
what
other
have
write
I
want
to
instead
compose
a
less
formalized
letter
from
the
perspective
of
someone
who
risk
money
on
politic
I
been
trade
political
and
event
market
since
2007
as
my
principal
occupation
I
be
one
of
the
most
active
trader
on
intrade
and
also
on
predictit
the
only
exception
be
2013
2014
and
2015
after
intrade
have
be
shut
down
but
before
predictit
become
viable
during
that
time
I
trade
stock
I
come
back
to
that
later
my
work
day
trade
political
event
be
largely
devoted
to
research
and
read
I
sometimes
design
model
and
often
use
spreadsheet
I
talk
to
expert
and
frequently
consult
with
other
people
I
sometimes
endeavor
to
find
information
before
reporter
find
it
my
job
be
time
consume
fun
hard
rewarding
tax
exciting
and
perhaps
most
of
all
dynamic
what
it
definitely
be
not
be
random
or
speculative
and
I
cringe
if
someone
call
it
gambling
try
to
predict
what
people
be
go
to
do
in
politic
either
predict
how
voter
be
go
to
vote
or
how
elect
official
be
go
to
make
decision
be
a
whole
lot
of
work
finally
it
be
not
luck
in
the
short
term
sometimes
it
be
but
not
over
the
long
run
I
have
be
able
to
consistently
make
a
living
do
this
for
15
year
give
my
experience
in
this
field
I
want
to
share
some
thought
on
the
question
pose
by
the
cftc
pricing
be
a
bulwark
against
misinformation
and
mislead
punditry
many
americans
be
in
news
silo
right
now
which
be
to
say
they
receive
news
from
one
perspective
or
silo
that
be
likely
deliver
that
news
in
a
biased
fashion
this
be
an
issue
that
social
medium
company
among
other
grapple
with
solve
the
problem
with
siloing
be
not
isolate
to
a
single
political
party
and
this
be
a
problem
that
be
become
more
prevalent
not
less
I
note
the
obvious
one
party
misinformation
be
undoubtedly
manifest
itself
in
far
bad
and
more
obvious
way
at
this
moment
but
misinformation
itself
be
not
a
phenomenon
of
just
one
side
of
the
aisle
far
to
that
point
a
lot
of
news
that
people
receive
be
in
the
form
of
punditry
by
expert
who
predict
what
will
happen
or
interpret
the
news
and
its
consequence
in
a
very
specific
way
market
cut
through
punditry
and
biased
observation
and
offer
a
perspective
that
will
be
much
close
to
the
truth
this
be
definitely
not
to
say
that
market
be
perfect
but
only
that
they
be
clearly
well
than
the
alternative
of
punditry
dominate
coverage
and
in
my
opinion
these
market
be
deeply
beneficial
as
an
arbiter
of
the
truth
in
a
world
where
the
consumption
of
news
be
become
more
biased
one
need
only
go
back
less
than
two
year
to
the
previous
election
where
the
pricing
of
donald
trump
to
become
the
next
president
be
still
around
10
for
month
after
he
be
declare
the
loser
of
the
race
in
that
time
he
mount
various
legal
and
extralegal
challenge
to
the
outcome
and
speak
openly
of
the
election
be
overturn
many
on
different
side
of
the
aisle
see
this
10
pricing
as
wildly
incorrect
for
very
different
reason
some
think
he
would
definitely
remain
president
near
100
and
other
think
it
be
impossible
0
chance
the
market
pricing
of
10
while
definitely
imperfect
communicate
the
reality
well
than
the
two
silo
it
relay
that
trump
be
strongly
disfavor
to
retain
the
presidency
while
also
communicate
to
everyone
that
the
possibility
of
a
successful
legal
or
extralegal
effort
to
retain
the
presidency
be
high
than
0
pricing
on
an
event
of
that
magnitude
be
extremely
important
information
to
possess
for
business
and
for
the
general
public
market
pricing
information
that
be
so
important
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
it
cost
of
disallow
the
market
be
not
negligible
unregulated
political
betting
on
we
election
by
us
person
will
happen
it
be
the
reality
of
the
situation
if
kalshi
and
other
dcms
be
permit
to
operate
a
market
on
congressional
control
much
of
the
political
event
trading
will
exit
unregulated
area
and
enter
regulated
area
under
the
auspex
of
the
cftc
new
market
participant
would
also
join
thus
make
the
pricing
far
more
robust
and
reliable
if
kalshi
and
other
dcms
be
not
permit
and
give
the
recent
ejection
of
predictit
all
regulated
or
quasi
regulate
bet
on
future
election
by
us
person
will
cease
in
the
us
and
entirely
move
to
unregulated
and
foreign
house
marketplace
this
would
be
a
huge
step
backward
and
will
shove
pricing
on
important
event
that
greatly
impact
this
country
into
a
dark
area
with
less
oversight
academia
and
industry
will
be
less
likely
to
cite
the
market
price
because
the
market
will
have
far
few
people
participate
and
specifically
far
few
american
this
mean
less
knowledge
of
market
pricing
and
a
large
increase
in
uncertainty
and
into
that
absence
of
certainty
creep
in
those
biased
source
of
news
and
information
election
market
have
exist
in
the
us
since
1992
without
incident
the
cftc
to
my
knowledge
have
issue
no
action
letter
to
three
entity
since
1992
the
iowa
electronic
market
iem
intrade
and
predictit
there
have
never
be
any
state
level
action
against
these
three
entity
nor
have
there
be
to
my
knowledge
any
interest
in
take
action
against
these
entity
by
state
intrade
operate
without
incident
on
its
election
specific
market
and
to
my
knowledge
be
shut
down
for
reason
unrelated
to
election
predictit
have
operate
without
incident
on
its
election
specific
market
it
unclear
why
the
cftc
be
shut
down
the
site
although
I
strongly
suspect
it
be
wholly
unrelated
to
the
actual
election
trading
iem
to
my
knowledge
have
have
no
incident
since
inception
all
of
this
be
to
say
that
there
have
be
trade
in
these
market
for
30
year
with
a
plethora
of
news
story
academic
study
and
usage
of
attention
to
these
market
and
during
those
30
year
the
case
for
a
regulated
market
on
election
have
only
be
strengthen
these
market
be
not
misuse
these
market
provide
valuable
information
and
these
market
be
not
target
by
state
with
the
only
federal
action
against
they
be
for
reason
that
be
unrelated
to
election
market
happen
in
west
virginia
be
not
an
analogue
a
brief
aside
here
a
previous
letter
cite
west
virginia
shutdown
of
election
bet
line
this
happen
after
bet
line
be
post
by
fanduel
sportsbook
with
permission
of
the
west
virginia
lottery
the
west
virginia
lottery
change
their
mind
on
the
follow
day
and
the
line
be
remove
within
24
hour
there
be
a
deep
distinction
between
bet
line
from
a
company
under
a
sport
bet
license
with
the
odd
place
right
alongside
odd
for
sport
game
and
a
peer
to
peer
cftc
permit
dcm
with
an
open
order
book
and
no
sport
bet
in
sight
the
west
virginia
lottery
would
not
be
task
with
oversee
or
at
all
involve
with
kalshi
and
other
dcms
a
platform
like
iem
intrade
predictit
or
hypothetically
kalshi
will
be
seek
out
specifically
by
a
user
in
order
to
make
prediction
on
election
it
would
be
wholly
distinct
from
sport
bet
continued
market
have
exist
in
other
country
without
incident
for
decade
action
take
by
foreign
country
may
not
be
relevant
to
the
cftc
decision
but
it
be
worth
point
out
that
the
we
would
not
be
trailblaze
a
controversial
area
of
prediction
market
trade
election
outcome
have
be
robust
in
other
country
for
decade
in
the
uk
for
instance
it
be
commonplace
and
not
controversial
I
be
stand
outside
of
westminster
this
summer
while
the
tory
party
be
vote
on
its
new
leader
and
a
tv
correspondent
have
the
odd
right
next
to
he
of
rishi
sunak
liz
truss
etc
while
he
be
present
it
be
neither
harmful
nor
controversial
to
inform
the
public
of
who
be
likely
to
lead
the
country
next
refer
back
to
my
discussion
of
news
silos
I
think
the
brexit
market
pricing
in
particular
cut
through
the
ability
of
the
two
side
of
that
extremely
contentious
debate
to
portray
the
outcome
in
a
way
that
deviate
significantly
from
reality
the
brexit
market
be
also
of
very
strong
salience
to
industry
that
be
sensitive
to
whether
the
uk
remain
in
the
european
union
generally
speak
have
visibility
to
the
market
likelihood
of
an
event
with
far
reach
consequence
and
the
ability
to
hedge
that
risk
if
necessary
be
both
important
the
mid
1800
to
around
1940
election
betting
be
commonplace
within
the
us
I
would
highlight
two
passage
from
this
paper
on
historical
bet
market
in
the
us
wager
on
presidential
election
have
a
long
tradition
in
the
united
states
with
large
and
often
well
organized
market
operate
for
over
three
quarter
of
a
century
before
world
war
ii
the
result
bet
odd
prove
remarkably
prescient
and
almost
always
correctly
predict
election
outcome
well
in
advance
despite
the
absence
of
scientific
poll
this
historical
experience
suggest
a
promising
role
for
other
prediction
market
our
analysis
complement
a
substantial
body
of
experimental
research
that
have
hint
that
asset
market
can
successfully
aggregate
information
although
large
sum
of
money
be
at
stake
in
the
historical
presidential
bet
market
we
be
not
aware
of
any
evidence
that
the
political
process
be
seriously
corrupt
by
the
presence
of
a
wagering
market
this
match
my
knowledge
and
experience
of
modern
election
market
and
highlight
the
two
most
important
point
1
the
information
that
the
market
provide
be
valuable
and
2
there
exist
no
evidence
of
a
connection
between
people
predict
election
and
corrupt
outcome
continue
hedger
already
use
imperfect
proxy
for
election
market
people
already
crudely
event
trade
with
exist
financial
instrument
there
be
a
large
number
of
article
write
before
election
on
what
stock
you
should
buy
if
you
think
the
republicans
or
democrats
be
go
to
win
for
instance
this
be
the
top
result
of
an
internet
search
on
stock
to
buy
in
the
2020
election
a
cfa
writing
in
kiplinger
on
the
13
good
stock
to
buy
if
president
donald
trump
win
re
election
this
be
one
example
of
many
article
that
dole
out
advice
on
how
to
bet
on
the
next
election
through
stock
I
sure
there
will
be
more
article
before
the
2022
midterm
election
trade
corporate
stock
and
derivative
thereof
be
just
one
way
to
predict
an
event
other
option
include
foreign
exchange
commodity
sovereign
debt
and
sophisticated
instrument
like
credit
default
swap
why
be
this
type
of
trading
do
before
an
event
it
of
high
importance
of
high
interest
and
the
ramification
can
be
quite
large
the
profit
can
be
as
well
I
personally
have
use
stock
and
derivative
trading
as
a
proxy
for
event
trading
include
trade
in
put
when
I
be
research
covid
in
early
2020
trade
in
for
profit
prison
company
as
a
proxy
for
political
control
trade
in
solar
company
as
a
proxy
for
political
control
and
trade
in
coal
company
as
a
proxy
for
political
control
but
these
be
imperfect
way
to
trade
the
underlie
event
I
could
be
completely
correct
about
a
certain
party
take
power
and
the
ramification
on
an
industry
but
the
specific
company
could
announce
it
be
under
investigation
for
some
unrelated
transgression
that
I
can
never
anticipate
or
the
trade
could
be
so
crowded
with
other
people
with
the
exact
same
thesis
that
everyone
be
try
to
exit
at
the
same
time
after
it
happen
and
the
trade
backfire
trade
the
actual
event
contract
be
always
go
to
be
the
pure
and
good
method
for
trade
an
event
rather
than
a
proxy
I
early
mention
that
I
briefly
trade
stock
as
my
occupation
the
reason
I
bring
that
up
be
because
I
profit
by
invest
in
company
with
a
well
research
thesis
use
the
same
principle
as
predict
election
but
I
also
find
that
stock
be
far
more
random
and
chance
base
than
participate
in
a
market
on
election
as
mention
the
stock
can
more
easily
succumb
to
the
vagary
of
random
chance
and
general
market
sentiment
thing
you
have
not
anticipate
and
could
not
anticipate
your
thesis
could
be
correct
but
you
could
still
easily
lose
money
because
of
how
interwoven
the
company
be
with
other
variable
hence
the
reason
that
I
go
back
to
election
in
2016
when
predictit
become
viable
it
be
far
less
common
in
event
trading
to
have
a
correct
thesis
and
also
lose
money
if
this
type
of
event
orient
trading
be
already
do
in
the
financial
sector
use
legitimate
but
crude
proxy
there
be
even
more
reason
to
bring
a
regulated
market
to
the
equation
it
would
offer
the
individual
and
company
conduct
these
trade
a
straightforward
way
to
make
similar
prediction
of
high
importance
event
with
a
noteworthy
distinction
low

and
randomness
of
sec
filing
from
company
mention
the
risk
of
politic
in
their
disclosure
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
letter
I
say
it
be
self
evident
that
hedging
be
possible
with
these
event
contract
I
want
to
highlight
something
that
I
have
not
see
mention
by
commenter
yet
publicly
trade
corporation
be
require
to
file
quarterly
and
annual

of

countless
number
I
be
go
to
conservatively
classify
it
as

because
that
be
how
many
I
personally
read
over
the
year
of
these
financial

specifically
relate
to

commensurate
with

this
be
just
one
example
many
many
industry
be
sensitive
to
change
in

power
to
vary

some
industry
like

be
extremely
sensitive
to
put
a
fine
point
on
it
the

the

people

that
5

that

currently
very
sensitive

political
control
be
able
to
hedge

both
important
and
obvious
what
may
be
less
obvious
be
that
robust
regulate

on
something
like
congressional

will
provide
these
company
and
individual
within
those

the
ability
to
quantify
those

the
contours
of
risk
be
often
a
blind
spot
for
many
company
company
can
know
the
risk
exist
but
not
how
to
measure
it
underestimate
or
overestimate
the
risk
could
have
costly
consequence
market
pricing
help
to
shine
a
light
on
political
risk
and
demystify
it
already
use
legitimate
financial

decision
should
not

base
on
whether
some
people
could
use

like

because
that
be
true
for
almost
all

it
be
not
logical
to

generally
I
have
find
that
the
argument
that
people
will
gamble
on
xyz
in
relation
to
election
market
to
be
a
red
herring
if
people
want
to
gamble
they
be
not
bereft
of
choice
the
option
be
plentiful
in
reality
from
my
experience
the
vast
majority
of
user
of
intrade
and
predictit
be
be
try
to
make
a
smart
prediction
risk
their
own
money
to
make
a
profit
this
be
exactly
what
constitute
a
healthy
market
I
suspect
kalshi
and
other
dcms
would
likewise
see
primarily
legitimate
market
participant
and
very
few
gambler
I
hope
my
thought
have
be
worthwhile
for
anyone
who
read
they
and
I
look
forward
to
the
forthcoming
decision
kind
