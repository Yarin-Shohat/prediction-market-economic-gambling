even

it

for

ask

whether

the

identify
no
statutory

that

ever
be
construe
that
way
it
suggest
there
be
no

under

because
in

perform

either
the

that
semantic
maneuver
would
render

as
any

understand
define
a

to

assign
it
two

not

as
an

illustration
of
the

of

consider
a

a

require

child
to
any

that

though
it
be
semantically

for

to

now
suppose

also
list
horror

those
additional

science

as
a

no

but
to
the

with

nor

nothing

of
gambling
that
sweep
in
any
and
all
wager
on
uncertain
contingency
but
that
approach
treat
gaming
as
a
catchall
for
anything
colloquially
describe
as
gambling
or
sweep
every
event
contract
into
this
category
and
it
hard
to
imagine
a
less
reasonable
construction
of
a
single
exception
on
an
enumerate
list
than
one
that
consume
each
of
its
neighbor
and
the
general
rule
to
boot
this
interpretation
do
not
make
sense
while
the
proposal
try
to
walk
the
tightrope
here
it
do
make
it
to
start
gaming
be
not
the
same
thing
as
gamble
dictionary
definition
and
common
legal
usage
alike
confirm
that
game
unlike
the
broad
term
gamble
or
require
a
predicate
game
to
be
sure
all
gaming
be
a
form
of
gambling
which
be
why
definition
of
the
former
sometimes
cross
reference
the
latter
but
the
converse
be
not
true
not
all
gambling
be
game
congress
choose
the
narrow
term
and
not
the
broad
one
next
conflate
gaming
with
gambling
only
walk
the
commission
into
another
problem
the
ordinary
definition
of
gambling
be
too
broad
to
fit
here
since
it
would
capture
all
contingent
event
the
commission
be
thus
force
to
gerrymander
a
limited
definition
of
gambling
to
cover
wager
on
game
or
contest
but
no
other
bet
that
limit
be
artificial
and
unpersuasive
and
untenable
in
context
since
it
would
turn
all
event
contract
into
gaming
but
as
describe
throughout
this
comment
even
a
definition
of
gaming
that
encompass
wager
on
contest
but
not
all
wager
on
contingent
event
fail
for
lack
of
any
support
in
the
cea
or
legislative
history
there
be
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
use
the
word
game
in
such
an
idiosyncratic
way
and
the
commission
do
bother
to
supply
one
if
congress
have
intend
to
cover
contract
on
election
it
surely
would
have
say
so
more
simply
in
a
rare
bright
spot
unlike
a
comment
of
well
market
which
fail
at
every
step
of
the
kalshi
order
the
proposal
rightfully
abandon
its
reliance
on
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
which
do
not
use
the
word
game
at
all
moreover
the
commission
construction
would
render
superfluous
all
the
other
enumerate
activity
ignore
the
interpretive
principle
that
every
clause
and
word
of
a
statute
should
have
meaning
and
it
would
grant
the
cftc
a
rove
commission
to
scrutinize
the
social
utility
of
all
event
contract
a
sweeping
surprising
power
congress
would
not
hide
in
a
single
word
especially
when
that
word
on
its
face
and
base
on
its
legislative
history
appear
to
be
concern
with
casino
and
sport
statutory
context
thus
foreclose
the
commission
overbroad
approach
to
gaming
give
the
term
its
ordinary
meaning
bet
on
game
avoid
all
of
those
pitfall
the
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
clause
be
unbounded
the
proposal
attempt
to
unobtrusively
expand
the
definition
of
gaming
to
include
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
as
explanation
the
commission
describe
this
particular
clause
as
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
upon
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
and
make
clear
that
it
be
of
no
import
whether
or
not
such
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
directly
affect
the
outcome
of
a
contest
or
game
this
radically
wide
range
definition
be
indefensible
as
it
include
in
its
ambit
every
potential
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
without
any
nexus
to
whether
it
have
any
relevance
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
itself
in
attempt
to
draw
a
line
in
the
water
the
proposal
include
various
example
I
whether
a
particular
candidate
enter
or
withdraw
from
a
political
contest
or
poll
above
or
below
a
certain
threshold
ii
whether
a
particular
individual
be
nominate
for
an
award
or
attend
an
award
ceremony
and
iii
in
the
context
of
an
athletic
game
the
score
or
individual
player
or
team
statistic
at
give
interval
during
the
game
whether
a
particular
player
will
participate
in
a
game
and
whether
a
particular
individual
will
attend
a
game
these
example
uncover
the
shallowness
of
any
attempt
logical
distinction
and
application
of
the
propose
definition
accord
to
the
cftc
own
example
whether
a
particular
individual
will
attend
a
game
whether
a
celebrity
attend
the
olympic
or
any
other
sporting
event
should
be
consider
in
connection
with
a
game
and
constitute
gaming
but
whether
that
same
celebrity
attend
the
dnc
or
a
concert
would
not
for
an
event
contract
on
the
attendance
of
a
celebrity
or
any
other
individual
it
should
not
matter
the
nature
of
the
event
that
she
be
attend
consider
the
same
celebrity
attend
a
performance
at
an
arena
on
two
night
in
a
row
in
the
same
seat
with
the
same
company
the
first
night
be
a
concert
and
the
second
be
an
nba
playoff
game
accord
to
the
cftc
own
example
an
event
contract
on
the
celebrity
first
night
attendance
would
be
benign
but
an
event
contract
on
the
second
night
attendance
would
be
game
the
mental
gymnastic
require
to
possibly
contemplate
a
reasonable
difference
in
this
poorly
concoct
proposal
should
earn
an
olympic
gymnastic
medal
but
it
will
be
do
because
it
can
be
do
in
the
same
vein
or
seine
the
proposal
would
consider
an
event
contract
on
the
host
city
of
the
next
olympic
would
be
consider
game
as
be
in
connection
with
the
olympic
game
but
the
olympic
game
create
a
significant
economic
impact
for
the
potential
host
city
a

global

article
describe
the
various
source
of

for
the

city
include
domestic
sponsorship
ticket
hospitality
venue
operation
and
the
local
revenue
and
economic
boost
of
tourism
construction
and
the
like
host
city
also
receive
a
portion
of
the
ioc
revenue
which
the
article
estimate
as
paris
receive
billion
for
the
2024
olympic
game
and
los

and
brisbane
slat
to
receive
billion
each
for
the
olympic
game
of
2028
and
2032
with
a
significant
economic
impact
such
as
this
at
stake
it
would
seem
incredulous
to
consider
all
olympic
adjacent
contract
as
game
the
proposal
itself
recognize
that
this
definition
be
far
beyond
anything
heretofore
see
in
law
and
regulation
in
introduce
the
four
illustrate
example
of
the
propose
definition
the
proposal
state
that
the
first
three
example
reflect
type
of
game
or
contest
which
have
be
recognize
as
gambling
bet
or
wager
under
relevant
state
and
federal
statute
and
would
constitute
gaming
under
the
propose
definition
as
a
threshold
matter
the
fact
that
the
commission
could
only
find
tangential
statutory
relevance
to
three
out
of
four
example
it
propose
to
include
in
the
definition
indicate
that
at
the
very
least
the
fourth
example
be
a
complete
commission
creation
base
on
nothing
more
than
conjecture
the
definition
of
gaming
should
not
include
election
and
award
instead
of
the
torture
reasoning
present
in
the
proposal
to
expand
the
definition
of
gaming
to
fit
agency
whim
the
commission
should
simply
acknowledge
that
if
congress
have
want
to
list
election
and
award
as
additional
enumerate
activity
in
the
cea
it
would
have
do
so
congress
could
have
include
election
and
award
in
the
list
of
enumerate
activity
in
the
cea
congress
could
have
define
gaming
to
include
contest
election
or
award
but
as
discuss
above
congress
do
neither
of
those
congress
do
not
include
election
and
award
in
the
discussion
or
definition
of
gaming
and
the
commission
can
do
so
on
its
own
either
the
commission
be
fond
of
rely
on
the
2010
colloquy
as
support
legislative
history
for
various
aspect
of
the
proposal
although
there
be
much
doubt
about
the
relevance
of
that
colloquy
to
the
substantive
matter
at
hand
as
describe
throughout
this
comment
and
countless
other
the
colloquy
be
not
only
unhelpful
to
the
proposal
in
this
instance
but
it
militate
against
the
propose
definition
for
one
simple
reason
the
entire
discussion
of
the
colloquy
center
around
example
of
sporting
event
senator
lincoln
response
to
senator
feinstein
question
about
the
cftc
authority
to
determine
that
a
contract
be
a
gaming
contract
be
that
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
event
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
master
golf
tournament
the
proposal
cherry
pick
from
the
colloquy
for
the
proposition
that
senator
lincoln
state
that
the
provision
be
intend
in
part
to
assure
that
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
prevent
gambling
through
future
market
but
this
miss
the
point
and
contort
it
senator
lincoln
describe
sporting
event
as
associate
with
gaming
but
not
election
or
award
or
anything
else
that
the
commission
could
imagine
in
fact
in
comment
number
74357
for
this
proposal
former
senator
lincoln
discuss
the
2010
colloquy
at
length
and
write
as
follow
I
be
deeply
trouble
by
the
recent
proposal
put
forth
by
the
cftc
the
federal
agency
that
be
task
with
administer
the
cea
in
prohibit
broad
category
of
contract
the
cftc
proposal
rely
heavily
on
a
2010
senate
colloquy
between
I
and
the
late
senator
feinstein
for
support
but
the
cftc
proposal
go
well
beyond
what
we
intend
this
heavy
handed
proposal
to
ban
market
rather
than
regulate
they
risk
undermine
the
core
principle
that
underpin
our
financial
market
principle
we
strive
to
uphold
through
carefully
craft
legislation
that
encourage
innovation
and
provide
consumer
protection
however
it
be
my
view
that
the
proposal
interpretation
entirely
miss
the
mark
the
law
be
mean
to
capture
recreational
gambling
on
sporting
event
and
casino
type
activity
not
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
or
the
outcome
of
major
election
these
event
be
nothing
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
or
the
master
tournament
if
we
have
intend
to
include
these
event
we
would
have
do
so
explicitly
we
do
not
because
those
event
unlike
the
result
of
a
sport
match
have
real
and
significant
economic
consequence
prohibit
future
contract
on
those
event
would
therefore
inhibit
the
sort
of
legitimate
economic
activity
that
our
market
be
design
to
promote
further
it
would
push
this
exist
legal
economic
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
market
with
little
to
no
consumer
protection
the
proposal
flimsy
reliance
on
an
unsupportive
colloquy
for
a
proposition
that
be
not
address
in
that
colloquy
should
be
scrap
iii
political
event
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
several
comment
have
raise
concern
that
allow
election
contract
could
create
incentive
to
manipulate
election
outcome
or
perception
undermine
election
integrity
and
that
political
event
contract
pose
significant
risk
to
public
interest
market
integrity
and
investor
protection
this
be
preposterous
political
event
contract
be
consistent
with
the
public
interest
in
multiple
way
first
they
can
consistently
and
reliably
serve
both
of
the
core
public
interest
function
of
the
derivative
market
namely
hedge
against
price
risk
and
enable
price
discovery
or
price
base
second
political
event
contract
would
not
undermine
election
integrity
foster
market
manipulation
or
inappropriately
cast
the
cftc
into
the
role
of
election
regulator
political
event
contract
serve
a
meaningful
hedging
and
price
discovery
function
as
describe
at
length
in
the
various
submission
to
the
commission
with
regard
to
kalshi
congressional
control
contract
the
kalshi
order
and
again
with
this
proposal
which
the
commission
must
consider
again
election
contract
serve
a
meaningful
and
undisputed
hedging
and
price
basing
function
business
face
a
panoply
of
potential
way
that
they
can
suffer
harm
that
will
affect
and
impact
their
value
the
value
of
their
service
and
the
value
of
their
asset
these
potential
harm
be
risk
risk
include
valuation
risk
the

of
the
business
service
or

decline

access
to

or
other
funding
decline
and
operational
risk
possible
disruption
or
error
in
the
production
process
that
undermine
their
earning
among
many
other
each
one
of
these
general
category
of
risk
will
manifest
and
impact
each
business
accord
to
the
business
unique
activity
profile
composition
etc
and
in
addition
to
these
example
there
be
many
more
category
of
risk
include
strategic
risk
getting
outcompete
by
a
competitor
reputation
risk
liability
risk
and
beyond
there
be
three
step
that
business
generally
follow
when
they
be
manage
the
risk
of
harm
the
first
step
be
to
identify
the
risk
mean
the
various
place
where
the
business
can
suffer
harm
such
as
negative
movement
in
cost
income
valuation
etc
the
second
step
be
for
the
business
to
assess
how
likely
it
be
that
the
potential
harm
will
materialize
and
how
severe
or
acute
will
the
impact
of
these
harm
be
in
order
to
do
that
the
business
must
consider
the
factor
that
can
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
the
risk
such
as
by
make
a
harm
more
likely
or
less
likely
to
occur
or
make
a
harm
more
severe
or
less
severe
etc
these
include
market
condition
and
all
relate
factor
that
can
have
a
bearing
on
the
potential
harm
to
illustrate
a
business
might
identify
that
a
decline
in
profit
margin
be
a
harm
that
it
face
one
of
the
many
factor
that
could
cause
this
harm
be
change
in
demand
for
its
product
that
will
change
what
it
can
charge
the
business
will
stop
there
though
it
will
identify
what
trend
or
event
will
create
a
change
in
demand
for
its
product
for
example
the
business
will
consider
what
market
force
impact
its
core
customer
base
a
slowdown
in
that
sector
might
have
a
correspond
downward
impact
on
the
demand
for
the
business
product
to
illustrate
consider
a
builder
of
extra
large
river
barge
in
the
upper
midwest
they
know
that
change
in
demand
impact
their
risk
but
they
need
to
know
what
affect
demand
naturally
they
look
to
key
factor
such
as
low
grain
yield
in
the
upper
mississippi
river
valley
as
low
grain
yield
may
mean
low
need
for
river
barge
both
of
these
be
factor
that
will
impact
the
acuteness
of
the
risk
whether
the
harm
be
likely
to
happen
and
how
severe
it
will
be
if
it
do
happen
as
a
result
they
may
purchase
short
contract
on
grain
future
in
order
to
hedge
their
risk
many
business
face
potential
harm
that
be
impact
by
inflation
inflation
can
impact
nearly
all
term
contract
impact
the
business
actual
cost
from
the
contract
for
instance
a
firm
lock
into
a
10
year
commercial
lease
on
their
office
space
will
see
low
real
cost
as
a
result
of
inflation
than
with
a
short
lease
however
if
the
company
be
also
an
intermediate
supplier
and
have
lock
in
their
sale
contract
they
have
agree
to
sell
ton
of
dap
di
ammonium
phosphate
fertilizer
at
900
ton
then
the
real
value
of
those
sale
decline
and
inflation
will
harm
they
of
course
inflation
affect
many
other
risk
as
well
high
inflation
raise
the
probability
that
the
federal
reserve
raise
its
target
interest
rate
which
tend
to
substantially
reduce
stock
valuation
and
the
value
of
asset
inflation
be
just
one
of
many
example
of
factor
that
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
potential
harm
to
mitigate
those
risk
they
may
seek
to
purchase
any
one
of
many
inflation
hedge
such
as
inflation
swap
inflation
protect
treasury
or
inflation
event
contract
political
control
represent
another
factor
that
could
impact
a
company
risk
profile
much
like
inflation
and
firm
proceed
use
the
same
risk
management
strategy
as
before
a
company
first
identify
risk
operational
reputational
valuation
credit
and
then
identify
the
way
those
risk
could
rise
or
fall
the
aforementioned
fertilizer
company
may
be
purchase
fertilizer
input
like
potash
from
other
country
potash
be
often
find
in
russia
belarus
and
china
and
identify
their
large
operational
risk
as
disruption
in
the
global
potash
supply
chain
they
far
identify
that
change
in
congressional
political
control
could
increase
the
probability
that
the
supply
chain
be
disrupt
since
different
congress
may
take
different
approach
to
tariff
sanction
and
other
trade
relate
policy
as
a
result
change
in
political
control
directly
increase
or
decrease
the
firm
operational
risk
perhaps
the
clear
example
of
this
description
of
risk
management
come
from
the
cftc
report
manage
climate
risk
in
the
financial
system
cftc
climate
report
as
expound
at
length
in
chapter
2
of
the
report
the

talk
at
length

concern
in

the

specifically
note
that
stake

risk
something
of

upon

it
should

as
be
obvious
to
anyone
who
vote
as
justification
for
this
the
commission
raise
several
allege
concern
first
that
this
particular
subset
of
gaming
contract
would
raise
unique
additional
public
interest
concern
relate
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
the
appropriate
role
of
the
commission
in
this
area
the
commission
creatively
consider
a
hypothetical
where
permit
trading
in
these
type
of
contract
could
create
monetary
incentive
to
vote
for
particular
candidate
even
when
such
vote
may
be
contrary
to
a
voter
or
organized
group
of
voter
political
view
second
conduct
design
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
could
be
use
to
manipulate
the
market
in
such
contract
or
conversely
that
the
market
in
such
contract
could
be
manipulate
to
influence
election
or
electoral
perception
and
as
an
example
false
reporting
or
other
misinformation
such
as
inaccurate
polling
or
voter
survey
or
false
news
reporting
could
be
use
to
distort
the
information
underlie
price
formation
in
such
contract
these
concern
fall
flat
neither
the
proposal
nor
the
kalshi
order
make
any
effort
to
substantiate
either
aspect
of
this
parade
of
horrible
and
instead
ignore
contrary
evidence
the
commission
can
find
no
real
world
example
that
election
contract
incentivize
manipulation
of
election
include
by
spread
misinformation
by
contrast
the
comment
submit
to
the
commission
in
support
of
kalshi
election
contract
note
repeatedly
that
the
likelihood
of
this
kind
of
manipulation
occur
be
extremely
remote
if
anything
list
the
contract
on
federally
regulate
exchange
would
ameliorate
manipulation
concern
associate
with
unregulated
and
offshore
market
and
the
neutral
market
drive
datum
generate
by
a
regulated
exchange
be
the
good
way
to
mitigate
the
threat
of
misinformation
include
from
the
fake
poll
that
the
cftc
purport
to
worry
about
in
the
kalshi
order
and
again
with
this
proposal
the
cftc
do
not
consider
any
relevant
datum
and
and
analysis
ignore
all
contrary
evidence
and
instead
speculate
that
election
contract
could
create
monetary
incentive
to
vote
for
particular
candidate
even
when
such
vote
may
be
contrary
to
a
voter
political
preference
or
view
of
such
candidate
besides
for
the
speculative
nature
of
this
concern
it
be
not
credible
voting
for
an
oppose
candidate
to
potentially
influence
an
outcome
contingent
on
dozen
of
federal
election
be
not
plausible
as
describe
in
the
comment
surround
the
kalshi
order
the
concern
that
voter
will
steal
vote
from
themselves
be
speculative
abstract
and
almost
entirely
absent
from
experience
with
political
prediction
market
more
fundamentally
the
notion
that
an
election
market
would
meaningfully
alter
incentive
to
manipulate
election
or
to
distribute
misinformation
be
utterly
implausible
give
the
enormous
consequence
of
election
outcome
the
massive
sum
already
spend
by
political
campaign
and
the
sheer
volume
of
input
to
the
national
political
discourse
election
contract
would
at
most
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket
moreover
the
very
length
to
which
the
commission
stretch
this
public
interest
concern
demonstrate
the
very
lack
of
any
actual
substantive
concern
as
note
in
footnote
124
of
the
proposal
the
commission
believe
that
permit
trading
in
contract
involve
political
contest
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
or
concern
a
supranational
organization
also
would
raise
these
public
interest
concern
just
as
permit
trading
in
contract
involve
political
contest
in
the
united
states
would
but
to
think
that
by
allow
trading
on
a
contract
on
a
political
contest
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
on
a
cftc
regulate
dcm
would
have
any
possible
impact
of
public
interest
concern
relate
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
the
appropriate
role
of
the
commission
in
this
area
in
a
foreign
election
a
foreign
country
where
the
cftc
have
not
one
iota
of
possible
jurisdiction
be
an
idea
completely
untethere
to
reality
be
the
cftc
concern
for
the
perception
of
weather
integrity
or
the
accuracy
rate
of
meteorologist
forecast
no
be
there
monetary
incentive
or
concern
of
false
reporting
or
other
misinformation
to
forecast
for
rain
when
a
meteorologist
want
a
sunny
day
or
other
manipulation
concern
as
to
the
weather
itself
no
and
weather
market
be
trade
on
cftc
regulate
entity
the
same
should
be
true
for
election
the
election
cop
concern
be
inconceivable
and
incongruent
with
commission
practice
as
an
additional
concern
the
proposal
note
that
the
commission
be
not
task
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
law
however
if
trading
be
permit
on
cftc
register
exchange
in
event
contract
that
involve
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
a
political
contest
then
the
commission
could
find
itself
investigate
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
that
suggestion
be
frankly
absurd
the
cftc
regulate
countless
derivative
market
involve
commodity
over
which
it
lack
independent
expertise
or
authority
for
example
while
the
commission
oversee
trading
in
future
contract
on
the
500
it
do
not
regulate
stock
that
be
the
job
of
the
security
and
exchange
commission
which
the
cftc
rely
on
to
police
the
underlie
market
likewise
while
the
cftc
supervise
trading
on
derivative
base
on
gdp
datum
it
be
the
bureau
of
economic
analysis
that
have
responsibility
for
produce
and
ensure
the
integrity
of
that
datum
the
same
be
true
for
various
other
contract
where
the
role
of
the
commission
be
to
oversee
the
trading
as
describe
in
the
2008
concept
release
on
the
appropriate
regulatory
treatment
of

contract
the

be
not

of

the

be
not
the

for

and

which

the

be

and
the
list
go
on
as
the
proposal
recognize
it
be
unlikely
that
congress
intend
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
or
expend
its
resource
to
regulate
election
that
be
correct
the
federal

commission
department
of

and
many
other
state
and
federal

already
shoulder
the
critical
responsibility
of
ensure
that
our

be
fair
and
secure
have
election
contract
trade
on
a
cftc

will
not
transform

into

already

the

acknowledge
that

fatal
to
this

however
the

ignore
the
fact
that
the
substance

itself
be

the

underpinning
of

on
the
outcome
of

of

this

the
kalshi

ask
for

on

of

prior

then
summarily
ignore
the

but
seemingly
absent
from

discussion
on
this
topic
be
that
partisan
control
of
congress
have
vast
economic
consequence
both
directly

through

similarly
a

of

jorge
paolo

explain
that
investment
may
look
very
different
if
hypothetical
legislative
and
regulatory
event
occur
and
if
an
election
outcome
make
those
event
materially
more
likely
it
pose
significant
risk
to
the

to
the
deal
for
example
if
republican
take
control
of
congress
in
2024
renewable

subsidy
will
not
vanish
overnight
but
a
republican
win
would
present

of

allow

on

registrant
allow

energy
firm
to
hedge
that
risk
commenter
write
that
their
firm
would
hedge
against
risk
that
a
hostile
government
could
be
elect
not
merely
that
a
particular
policy
will
be
enact
and
that
investor
consider
how
business
risk
indisputably
rise
when
certain
congress
come
into
power
and
hedging
instrument
be
need
to
mitigate
that
risk
this
example
of
which
there
be
many
more
demonstrate
this
proposal
hamartia
the
continue
refusal
to
engage

and

by
commenter
that
be
on
point
but
adverse
to
the
commission
agenda
lay
out
in
the

I
encourage
the

not
to
do
the

with
this

all

submit
vi
the

cost

measure
relative

this

would
not
create
meaningful

for
market
participant
and
the
public
and
would
instead
result
in
substantial
cost
cost
that
would
far
outweigh
any
incorrect
benefit
the
proposal
suggest
as
require
to
by
section
of
the

the

must
consider
the

this

fail
in

one
the
cost
of

considerably
eclipse
any
incorrectly

the
commission
contemplate
that
some

may
incur
a
one

cost
to
understand
and
implement
the
propose
gaming
definition
but
the
proposal
do
seem
to
understand
the
far
reach
implication
of
its
propose
regulation
the
only
one
time
compliance
cost
that
be
possible
under
the
proposal
be
the
cost
of
close
down
a
register
entity
business
because
as
explain
above
the
proposal
be
so
pervasive
to
event
contract
it
will
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
regulated
industry
but
not
the
unregulated
industry
they
will
happily
continue
to
serve
customer
without
any
form
of
oversight
far
more
than
the
10
hour
approximate
by
the
commission
the
destructive
impact
of
this
proposal
be
indicate
by
the
commission
own
explanation
of
anticipated
implementation
if
the

rule

be
adopt
the

anticipate
that

whose

delist

may
also
need
to
take
step
to
effectuate
the
orderly
wind
down
of
contract
involve

that
be
list
and
available
for

as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
final
rule
amendment
in
the
federal
register
and
that
have
settlement
date
beyond
the
60
day
implementation
period
propose
by
the
commission
in
other
word
the
commission
be
anticipate
the
entire
business
will
be
shutter
in
60
hour
or
less
unlike
the
commission
assertion
otherwise
the
number
of
contract
impact
by
this
proposal
be
vast
the
commission
claim
that
the
propose
definition
also
would
support
the
commission
and
its
staff
in
the
effective
oversight
of
derivative
market
include
by
support
the
efficient
and
effective
administration
of
the
contract
submission
and
review
process
by
help
to
reduce
the
likelihood
that
contract
be
submit
to
the
commission
that
raise
public
interest
concern
in
this
regard
among
other
thing
the
propose
definition
would
promote
the
commission
responsible
stewardship
and
efficient
use
of
the
tax
dollar
appropriate
to
it
by
reduce
the
need
for
individualized
contract
review
pursuant
to
in
the
commission
experience
a
review
pursuant
to
be
resource
intensive
and
consume
hundred
of
hour
of
staff
time
base
on
prior
experience
the
commission
estimate
that
each
review
conduct
pursuant
to
take
on
average
approximately
625
hour
of
commission
staff
time
at
a
cost
of
approximately
but
instead
of
focus
on
curtail
the
industry
on
unreasonable
ground
the
commission
should
embrace
its
regulatory
function
develop
a
mechanism
to
more
efficiently
review
event
contract
and
ask
congress
to
fund
more
staff
the
commission
fail
to
contemplate
the
cost
of
the
propose
amendment
to
far
align
with
statutory
language
which
be
vast
far
more
than
any
potential
benefit
as
describe
above
the
proposal
understanding
of
the
term
involve
in
the
statute
be
incorrect
and
inconsistently
apply
by
the
commission
the
proposal
also
fail
to
analyze
the
associate
cost
and
benefit
of
this
change
at
all
one
obvious
cost
of
this
aspect
of
the
proposal
be
that
it
create
wild
uncertainty
the
proposal
would
create
a
malleable
definition
that
would
be
apply
by
the
commission
at
whim
result
in
register
entity
and
market
participant
not
know
whether
or
not
an
event
contract
would
be
single
out
by
the
commission
for
analysis
thus
disrupt
the
event
contract
industry
there
be
no
benefit
to
consider
for
this
result
perhaps
that
be
why
the
commission
do
list
any
the
proposal
fail
each
of
the
section
factor
the
proposal
evaluation
of
the
cost
and
benefit
of
the
propose
amendment
to
in
light
of
the
five
broad
area
of
market
and
public
concern
identify
in
section
of
the
cea
fail
1
protection
of
market
participant
and
the
public
contrary
to
the
commission
state
belief
the
propose
amendment
to
will
not
protect
market
participant
and
the
public
unlike
the
commission
assertion
that
event
contract
could
particularly
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
market
participant
and
that
the
propose
amendment
would
accordingly
enhance
protection
of
market
participant
the
opposite
be
true
the
propose
prevention
of
the
listing
for
trading
or
acceptance
for
clearing
by
register
entity
of
certain
event
contract
and
those
involve
gaming
as
propose
to
be
define
would
harm
market
participant
by
remove
a
bona
fide
hedge
instrument
from
the
few
financial
risk
management
tool
available
to
the
mainstream
public

participant
business

efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
market
the
proposal
will
decimate
the
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
the
event
contract
market
it
be
seek
to
remove
from
the
cftc
regulate
space
under
the
guise
of
a
just
limited
to
game
analysis
the
commission
claim
that
a
significant
proportion
of
event
contract
offering
would
not
be
impact
by
the
propose
amendment
suggest
that
the
overall
impact
of
the
rule
amendment
should
be
relatively
modest
moreover
the
state
belief
of
the
commission
be
that
by
far
specify
type
of
event
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
may
not
be
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clear
the
propose
amendment
also
will
support
these
and
other
register
entity
ability
to
develop
and
list
new
product
with
enhanced
confidence
regard
such
product
compliance
with
the
cea
and
cftc
regulation
the
commission
believe
that
this
should
assist
register
entity
as
well
as
applicant
for
registration
in
make
informed
business
decision
with
respect
to
product
design
which
may
enhance
competitiveness
and
efficiency
the
only
help
that
this
proposal
would
provide
be
to
eliminate
the
indecision
of
whether
the
regulated
path
be
the
right
one
if
approve
the
event
contract
sphere
will
be
force
away
from
the
regulated
space
a
result
that
as
demonstrate
from
the
ftx
collapse
and
the
existence
of
polymarket
be
surely
not
one
the
commission
be
hop
for
3
price
discovery
as
barely
acknowledge
by
the
commission
the
propose
amendment
will
have
a
direct
and
significant
impact
on
price
discovery
in
cftc
regulate
market
as
be
obvious
event
contract
provide
strong
informational
value
about
the
consensus
of
a
crowd
of
market
participant
who
be
willing
to
put
money
where
their
mouth
be
a
strong
price
basing
utility
that
the
commission
do
not
include
this
in
the
proposal
indicate
that
it
have
yet
to
understand
the
true
value
of
event
contract
specifically
for
its
price
basing
utility
instead
of
shut
they
down
the
commission
should
seek
to
understand
and
guide
the
future
development
of
event
contract
market
4
sound
risk
management
practice
the
commission
could
not
identify
any
effect
of
the
propose
amendment
on
sound
risk
management
practice
that
be
because
in
the
commission
mind
the
propose
amendment
be
in
the
public
interest
the
exact
opposite
be
true
as
describe
above
all
market
participant
be
involve
in
risk
management
of
their
business
for
example
or
other
aspect
that
impact
their
life
those
be
risk
that
can
be
manage
by
event
contract
when
those
event
contract
be
oversee
by
the
cftc
that
risk
management
be
do
in
a
sound
and
safe
manner
the
commission
should
look
to
embrace
event
contract
not
reject
they
for
lack
of
understand
5
other
public
interest
consideration
the
proposal
consideration
of
public
interest
consideration
be
a
straw
man
the
commission
first
state
that
the
purpose
of
be
for
the
commission
to
determine
that
certain
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
may
not
be
list
or
make
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
register
entity
and
therefore
the
propose
amendment
seek
to
support
this
objective
by
far
specify
the
type
of
event
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
may
not
be
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clearing
because
as
describe
above
the
proposal
misconstrue
the
commission
statutory
mandate
and
the
public
interest
it
follow
that
any
mistaken
consideration
of
the
public
interest
necessarily
fail
a
building
can
not
be
successfully
build
on
faulty
foundation
so
too
this
proposal
