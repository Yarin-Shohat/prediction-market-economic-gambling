former
senator
blanche
lincoln
recently
express
her
deep
concern
over
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
certain
category
of
contract
include
election
market
by
reference
a
2010
colloquy
between
herself
and
the
late
senator
dianne
feinstein
she
emphasize
that
the
cftc
interpretation
of
this
colloquy
go
beyond
what
be
intend
senator
lincoln
highlight
that
the
proposal
to
ban
market
outright
rather
than
regulate
they
risk
undermine
the
core
principle
that
underpin
our
financial
market
these
principle
include
foster
innovation
and
provide
consumer
protection
which
be
central
to
the
legislation
she
help
craft
I
agree
with
senator
lincoln
perspective
and
believe
it
be
crucial
for
the
cftc
to
focus
on
regulation
rather
than
prohibition
proper
regulation
can
ensure
that
prediction
market
operate
transparently
and
ethically
provide
valuable
insight
and
hedge
opportunity
without
resort
to
unregulated
offshore
platform
by
encourage
innovation
within
a
structured
regulatory
framework
the
cftc
can
uphold
the
integrity
of
the
market
while
protect
consumer
and
promote
economic
growth
the
focus
should
be
on
create
a
balanced
approach
that
align
with
the
original
legislative
intent
to
prevent
gambling
while
foster
legitimate
economic
us
