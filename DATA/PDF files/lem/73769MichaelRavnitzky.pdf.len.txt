I
be
write
to
offer
my
view
on
the
propose
rule
concern
event
contract
in
certain
exclude
commodity
definition
the
current
definition
especially
for
gaming
be
too
broad
and
lack
specificity
this
could
lead
to
unintended
consequence
where
legitimate
market
activity
be
inadvertently
include
within
the
scope
of
regulation
for
instance
a
contract
that
include
a
performance
bonus
base
on
a
team
victory
in
a
sporting
event
could
be
misclassifie
as
game
under
the
propose
rule
to
avoid
ambiguity
I
suggest
refine
the
definition
with
clear
example
and
criterion
that
distinguish
between
regulated
and
non
regulated
activity
the
commission
should
express
openness
to
revisit
the
definition
of
gaming
as
it
gain
more
experience
with
this
regulatory
area
scope
of
regulation
the
scope
of
regulation
should
be
clearly
define
to
prevent
overreach
it
be
essential
to
establish
what
be
explicitly
include
and
exclude
from
the
rule
to
ensure
that
it
target
only
those
contract
that
pose
a
risk
to
market
integrity
or
public
interest
for
example
contract
that
involve
speculative
bet
on
unpredictable
event
should
be
include
while
those
that
be
part
of
standard
business
operation
should
be
exclude
a
measured
approach
be
necessary
to
balance
consumer
protection
with
market
efficiency
the
rule
should
be
flexible
enough
to
adapt
to
change
market
condition
while
provide
clear
guideline
for
market
participant
provide
a
process
for
address
new
class
of
contract
no
one
can
anticipate
all
the
class
of
event
contract
that
may
arise
such
as
new
type
of
hybrid
contract
to
accommodate
new
development
in
financial
product
without
stifle
innovation
the
cftc
should
build
in
a
process
for
review
and
approve
new
category
of
event
contract
this
process
should
involve
an
advisory
committee
with
diverse
representation
and
a
structured
public
comment
period
to
gather
input
from
all
stakeholder
small
wager
predictive
market
be
socially
valuable
and
should
not
be
impede
predictive

to

social
benefit
that
contribute
to
their
overall
value
and
utility
these
market
serve
as
a
form
of
collective
intelligence
where
the
aggregated
prediction
of
a
diverse
group
of
individual
can
lead
to
more
accurate
forecast
than
any
single
expert
could
provide
and
there
be
a
long
history
of
predictive
market
that
provide
useful
experience
and
shed
light
on
how
they
can
operate
safely
and
effectively
a
tolerant
approach
toward
small
wager
predictive
market
have
many
benefit
first
predictive
market
aggregate
information
from
a
wide
array
of
participant
each
with
their
own
unique
insight
and
perspective
this
collective
wisdom
can
lead
to
more
informed
decision
making
and
well
outcome
second
by
allow
individual
to
wager
small
amount
predictive
market
distribute
risk
across
a
large
pool
of
participant
reduce
the
potential
impact
on
any
single
individual
third
participant
in
predictive
market
be
incentivize
to

which
can
lead
to
increase
engagement
and
participation
in
various
social
and
economic
activity
fourth
predictive
market
can
enhance
market
efficiency
by
provide
real
time
datum
on
public
sentiment
and
expectation
which
can
be
valuable
for
business
policymaker
and
researcher
finally
these
market
encourage
innovation
by
provide
a
platform
for
new
idea
and
hypothesis
to
be
test
and
validate
through
collective
bet
cftc
should
carve
out
light
regulation
for
small
stake
predictive
market
because
in
general
the
benefit
outweigh
the
risk
and
the
risk
be
minimize
with
appropriate
licensing
strike
a
sound
balance
in
general
it
be
important
to
strike
a
balance
between
regulation
and
freedom
over
regulation
could
stifle
the
very
innovation
and
efficiency
that
these
market
provide
therefore
it
be
crucial
to
implement
a
regulatory
framework
that
protect
participant
from
fraud
and
manipulation
while
allow
the
market
to
operate
freely
within
reasonable
bound
they
should
not
be
subject
to
over
regulation
but
rather
be
support
with
a
regulatory
framework
that
ensure
fairness
and
integrity
this
do
not
mean
that
there
should
be
a
wild
west
mentality
just
because
something
be
propose
do
not
mean
that
it
will
not
have
negative
externality
promote
undue
financial
risk
allow
money
laundering
and
other
illegal
activity
or
result
in
unintended
consequence
