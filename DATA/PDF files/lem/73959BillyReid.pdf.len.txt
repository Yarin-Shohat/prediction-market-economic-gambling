I
support
the
undertaking
a
rulemake
on
event
contract
which
be
long
overdue
during
my
tenure
on
the
commission
I
have
consistently
call
for
a
rulemaking
process
to
establish
a
framework
for
the
commission
to
exercise
the
discretionary
authority
with
respect
to
event
contract
that
congress
grant
to
the
agency
in
our
governing
statute
the
commodity
exchange
act
unfortunately
though
I
can
not
support
this
particular
proposed
rulemake
the
proposal
at
first
blush
it
appear
to
be
much
ado
about
as
it
seem
to
do
little
more
than
rubber
stamp
what
the
commission
have
already
say
and
do
upon
close
inspection
though
it
be
a
wolf
in
sheep
because
where
the
proposal
depart
from
our
past
practice
it
lay
the
foundation
to
prohibit
entire
category
of
potential
exchange
trade
event
contract
whose
term
and
condition
the
commission
have
never
even
see
in
plant
the
seed
of
future
ban
of
countless
event
contract
sight
unseen
the
proposal
exceed
the
legal
authority
that
congress
grant
the
commission
in
the
cea
rely
heavily
on
a
brief
snippet
of
legislative
history
consist
of
a
colloquy
between
two
senator
cherry
pick
part
of
the
colloquy
it
like
while
ignore
other
part
of
the
same
colloquy
resurrect
an
economic
purpose
test
for
evaluate
the
public
interest
that
be
base
on
a
provision
of
the
cea
that
be
repeal
by
congress
nearly
a
quarter
century
ago
fail
to
do
the
hard
work
of
analyze
the
unique
nature
of
event
contract
which
be
different
in
kind
from
traditional
derivative
contract
more
familiar
to
the
agency
rely
on
unsupported
conjecture
treat
similar
circumstance
differently
and
raise
more
question
than
it
answer
and
fly
in
the
face
of
the
cftc
mandate
to
promote
responsible
innovation
as
congress
direct
in
the
cea
my
dissent
should
not
be
take
as
an
indication
that
I
be
a
fan
of
all
event
contract
but
it
be
hard
not
to
conclude
from
the
multitude
of
defect
in
this
proposal
that
its
significant
overreach
be
motivate
more
by
a
seemingly
visceral
antipathy
to
event
contract
than
by
reason
analysis
it
do
not
matter
whether
we
think
event
contract
be
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea
the
commission
must
exercise
its
authority
with
respect
to
event
contract
within
the
scope
of
the
cftc
legal
authority
and
must
appropriately
implement
the
authority
that
congress
have
provide
we
this
proposal
fail
both
test

event
contract
in
brief
cea

which
be
add
to
the

in
2010
by
the

the

to

and
2
the

determine

also
provide
that
the

may

which
would
subject

congress
in

do
not
decree
that

involve

be
contrary
to
the

per

rather
if
an

involve

activity
the
commission
may
determine
that
it
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibit
from

which
necessarily
indicate
that
the
commission
also
have
the
discretion
to
determine
that
it
be
not
a

after

of
the

the

adopt

the

neither

the

acknowledge
that

require
further
clarification

say
that

I
agree
that
13
year
later
it
be
long
past
time
for
the
commission
to
do
so
but
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
be
much
too
broad
1
the
proposal
sweep
in
the
universe
of
every
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
include
both
the
outcome
of
a
game
and
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitor
in
a
game
so
far
so
good
but
it
then
tack
on
an
additional
category
of
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
the
all
encompass
nature
of
the
phrase
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
be
self
evident
and
that
universality
be
far
reinforce
by
its
attachment
to
the
in
connection
with
word
the
motivation
for
this
expansive
wording
in
the
proposal
be
likely
that
where
the
phrase
in
connection
with
appear
in
various
enforcement
provision
of
the
cea
the
commission
interpret
it
broadly
not
technically
or
restrictively
and
the
proposal
give
no
indication
that
it
should
be
interpret
any
differently
here
in
fact
the
proposal
at
page
29
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
staking
or
risk
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
event
in
connection
with
a
game
would
be
as
much
of
a
wager
or
a
bet
on
the
game
as
stake
or
risk
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
would
be
under
this
incredibly
far
reach
formulation
there
be
countless
or
in
connection
with
a
game
that
the
proposal
would
deem
to
be
game
obvious
example
include
event
contract
involve
the
attendance
at
a
baseball
or
football
game
or
whether
a
particular
nation
will
be
select
to
host
a
soccer
world
cup
these
would
clearly
be
in
connection
with
the
underlie
baseball
football
or
soccer
game
but
there
be
no
reason
why
stake
something
of
value
on
those
contingent
event
should
be
treat
the
same
as
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
those
game
indeed
there
be
no
well
illustration
of
the
overbreadth
of
the
in
connection
with
aspect
of
the
propose
gaming
definition
than
the
proposal
own
example
at
page
32
of
whether
a
particular
individual
will
attend
a
game
it
be
difficult
to
fathom
why
an
event
contract
involve
whether
taylor
swift
will
attend
a
kansas
city
chiefs
football
game
should
constitute
gaming
and
impossible
to
understand
why
the
proposal
treat
similar
thing
differently
since
whether
she
attend
a
beyoncé
concert
would
not
constitute
gaming
I
acknowledge
that
it
might
be
appropriate
to
extend
the
definition
of
gaming
to
include
event
that
can
affect
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
the
performance
of
a
competitor
in
a
game
event
contract
involve
say
whether
an
injury
to
shohei
ohtani
would
prevent
he
from
play
in
the
world
series
or
involve
the
score
of
a
football
game
at
halftime
might
be
example
of
this
but
to
broadly
define
as
game
every
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
regardless
of
whether
it
have
any
bearing
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
the
performance
of
a
competitor
in
the
game
be
wholly
unwarranted
2
election
and
award
be
not
game
the
proposal
rubber
stamp
two
prior
commission
order
that
find
that
event
contract
involve
political
control
or
election
be
essentially
repeat
the
same
discussion
from
those
order
and
then
throw
award
into
its
gaming
definition
as
well
yet
this
definition
be
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
cea
section
legislative
history
on
which
for
other
issue
discuss
below
the
proposal
rely
heavily
that
legislative
history
consist
of
a
colloquy
between
senator
blanche
lincoln
and
dianne
feinstein
senator
lincoln
be
then
the
chair
of
the
senate
committee
on
agriculture
nutrition
and
forestry
which
be
the
cftc
authorize
committee
in
the
colloquy
the
senator
talk
about
game
only
in
the
limited
context
of
sporting
event
in
respond
to
senator
feinstein
question
about
the
cftc
authority
under
section
to
determine
that
a
contract
be
a
gaming
contract
senator
lincoln
say
that
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
event
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
master
golf
tournament
thus
senator
lincoln
clearly
associate
game
with
sporting
event
but
rather
than
remain
true
to
the
legislative
history
that
equate
gaming
with
only
sporting
event
the
proposal
broadly
sweep
all
contest
into
its
definition
of
gaming
and
it
then
conclude
that
election
and
award
be
contest
and
therefore
game
even
though
neither
senator
lincoln
nor
senator
feinstein
ever
mention
election
or
award
or
contest
for
that
matter
the
proposal
attempt
to
squeeze
election
and
award
into
the
gaming
category
through
the
follow
torture
chain
of
reasoning
gaming
mean
gamble
some
state
statute
link
gambling
to
bet
or
wager
on
contest
therefore
contest
include
election
and
award
constitute
gaming
yet
one
have
to
ask
if
congress
have
intend
for
election
and
award
to
be
enumerate
activity
be
it
more
likely
that
section
would
have
include
election
and
award
in
its
list
of
enumerate
activity
or
enumerate
gaming
and
hop
the
commission
would
o
define
gaming
to
include
contest
and
o
consider
contest
to
include
election
and
award
congress
easily
could
have
include
election
and
award
as
enumerate
activity
but
it
do
not
confront
with
this
congressional
silence
I
do
not
believe
the
commission
can
simply
decree
that
election
and
award
be
enumerate
activity
and
this
be
especially
the
case
when
congress
in
cea
section
provide
the
commission
with
a
ready
make
process
for
determine
through
a
rulemaking
proceeding
whether
contest
election
award
be
similar
to
the
enumerate
activity
include
gaming
I
be
baffle
at
why
the
commission
be
tie
itself
into
knot
by
try
to
reason
its
way
from
gaming
to
gambling
to
contest
to
election
and
award
rather
than
simply
do
what
congress
say
it
could
do
consider
whether
election
and
award
be
similar
to
gaming
or
another
enumerate
activity
this
be
not
a
matter
of
form
over
substance
approach
matter
when
it
come
to
exercise
our
authority
under
the
cea
and
I
can
not
support
the
proposal
approach
to
stretch
the
statutory
term
game
to
include
election
and
award
the
commission
lack
legal
authority
to
determine
in
advance
that
entire
category
of
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
overbreadth
of
the
proposal
gaming
definition
would
suffice
for
I
to
dissent
but
the
proposal
most
brazen
overreach
be
its
determination
in
advance
that
every
event
contract
that
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
regardless
of
the
term
and
condition
of
that
contract
the
proposal
would
prohibit
these
contract
sight
unseen
through
the
shortcut
of
declare
entire
category
of
event
contract
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
the
commission
lack
legal
authority
under
the
cea
to
make
public
interest
determination
by
category
the
proposal
justification
for
its
approach
at
page
37
be
that
the
statute
do
not
require
this
public
interest
determination
to
be
make
on
a
contract
specific
basis
this
be
backwards
the
cftc
be
a
creature
of
statute
and
have
only
the
authority
grant
to
it
by
the
cea
there
be
no
provision
in
cea
section
for
public
interest
determination
regard
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
to
be
make
by
category
accordingly
the
commission
can
not
claim
that
authority
through
the
ipse
dixit
of
congress
do
say
we
could
this
be
not
a
mere
question
of
what
procedure
to
follow
the
proposal
would
allow
the
commission
to
make
the
substantive
policy
determination
that
entire
category
of
event
contract
regardless
of
their
term
and
condition
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
consequence
of
such
a
determination
be
severe
a
complete
prohibition
on
exchange
ability
to
list
event
contract
and
on
market
participant
ability
to
trade
they
if
congress
have
intend
for
the
commission
to
wield
this
immense
authority
surely
it
would
have
say
so
in
fact
in
another
cea
provision
similar
to
cea
section
that
also
be
add
by
the
frank
act
congress
do
say
so
cea
section
specifically
state
that
the
commission
shall
review
each
swap
or
any
group
category
type
or
class
of
swap
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
swap
or
group
category
type
or
class
of
swap
should
be
require
to
be
clear
thus
when
it
enact
the
dodd
frank
act
congress
know
how
to
tell
the
commission
that
it
could
make
a
determination
on
either
an
individual
or
categorical
basis
when
it
want
to
do
in
contrast
congress
do
not
say
in
cea
section
that
the
commission
could
make
public
interest
determination
for
event
contract
by
category
the
proposal
premise
be
that
a
grant
of
authority
to
make
a
determination
about
one
thing
necessarily
include
authority
to
make
a
determination
about
a
category
of
such
thing
unless
congress
say
otherwise
but
if
that
be
the
case
then
there
be
no
need
for
congress
to
tell
the
commission
in
cea
section
that
it
could
make
mandatory
swap
clearing
determination
either
by
individual
swap
or
by
the
proposal
determination
would
render
statutory
text
in
cea
section
mere
surplusage
in
violation
of
established
canon
of
statutory
it
also
would
violate
the
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
provision
enact
as
part
of
the
same
statute
here
the
dodd
frank
act
should
be
construe
in
a
similar
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
text
in
cea
section
like
that
in
cea
section
I
can
not
accept
that
congress
silently
authorize
the
cftc
to
make
life
easy
for
itself
through
the
shortcut
of
make
impactful
determination
that
entire
category
of
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
be
prohibit
from
trade
on
exchange
iv
even
if
there
be
legal
authority
the
proposal
fail
to
justify
make
advance
public
interest
determination
by
category
for
a
host
of
reason
even
if
the
commission
have
legal
authority
to
make
public
interest
determination
for
event
contract
by
category
the
proposal
be
wholly
unpersuasive
in
its
attempt
to
justify
do
so
there
be
a
multitude
of
failing
1
there
be
no
basis
to
resurrect
the
repealed
economic
purpose
test
which
should
be
apply
to
event
contract
in
any
event
the
proposal
would
ban
entire
category
of
event
contract
as
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
base
largely
on
the
proposition
that
they
fail
the
economic
purpose
test
there
be
four
significant
problem
with
this
approach
congressional
intent
first
the
proposal
rely
on
a
single
ambiguous
passage
in
the
legislative
history
to
conclude
that
congress
intend
for
purpose
of
a
public
interest
review
of
an
event
contract
to
resurrect
the
economic
purpose
test
that
the
commission
once
use
to
determine
whether
a
future
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
until
congress
repeal
that
public
interest
requirement
in
the
proposal
resurrection
of
the
economic
purpose
test
be
base
entirely
on
this
one
passage
in
the
colloquy
between
senator
dianne
feinstein
and
senator
blanche
lincoln
feinstein
will
the
cftc
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
be
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
be
speculative
as
oppose
to
hedging
or
economic
use
lincoln
that
be
our
intent
the
commission
need
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivative
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
suppose
event
contract
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
event
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
master
golf
tournament
these
type
of
contract
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
use
solely
for
to
be
clear
the
dodd
frank
act
do
not
codify
the
commission
prior
economic
purpose
test
and
I
can
not
accept
the
proposal
assertion
that
this
isolate
colloquy
between
two
senator
establish
an
intent
by
the
whole
of
congress
that
the
commission
conduct
its
public
interest
review
of
event
contract
base
on
an
economic
purpose
test
that
the
commission
have
withdraw
as
a
result
of
the
repeal
by
the
whole
of
congress
of
the
statutory
provision
it
implement
a
decade
early
after
all
neither
senator
feinstein
nor
senator
lincoln
use
the
term
economic
purpose
test
or
refer
to
the
commission
guideline
no
1
that
set
out
that
test
as
someone
who
spend
over
a
decade
work
in
congress
and
who
be
present
on
the
senate
floor
for
countless
colloquy
and
even
have
a
hand
in
prepare
talking
point
for
similar
floor
discussion
I
be
confident
that
if
the
senator
believe
we
should
resurrect
the
economic
purpose
test
they
would
have
say
just
that
difference
in
kind
second
the
economic
purpose
test
be
design
for
traditional
future
contract
that
have
be
list
and
trade
on
exchange
for
these
contract
differ
in
kind
from
event
contract
which
typically
be
structure
as
binary
yes
no
option
the
two
prong
of
the
economic
purpose
test
which
the
proposal
adopt
as
a
primary
basis
for
prohibit
entire
category
of
event
contract
as
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
evaluate
1
the
contract
utility
for
price
basing
and
2
whether
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
purpose
yet
the
commission
itself
have
previously
recognize
the
difference
between
event
contract
and
the
traditional
future
contract
for
which
the
economic
purpose
test
be
develop
in
a
concept
release
issue
in
2008
the
commission
state
that
iln
general
event
contract
be
neither
dependent
on
nor
do
they
necessarily
relate
to
market
price
or
broad
base
measure
of
economic
or
commercial
activity
and
elaborate
as
follow
since
2005
the
commission
staff
have
receive
a
substantial
number
of
request
for
guidance
on
the
propriety
of
offering
and
trade
financial
agreement
that
may
primarily
function
as
information
aggregation
vehicle
these
event
contract
generally
take
the
form
of
financial
agreement
link
to
eventuality
or
measure
that
neither
derive
from
nor
correlate
with
market
price
or
broad
economic
or
commercial
in
other
word
the
proposal
would
ban
entire
category
of
event
contract
largely
on
the
basis
of
price
base
and
hedging
requirement
that
event
contract
describe
in
the
concept
release
as
information
aggregation
vehicle
likely
because
of
their
very
structure
have
little
chance
of
satisfy
this
problem
be
compound
by
the
fact
that
under
the
proposal
some
event
contract
that
fail
to
satisfy
the
economic
purpose
test
would
be
ban
while
other
contract
fail
the
test
would
not
for
example
the
proposal
statement
at
page
52
that
most
contract
fall
within
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
would
have
no
underlie
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transaction
to
provide
directly
correlate
price
form
information
be
equally
true
of
weather
relate
event
contract
but
those
contract
would
not
be
ban
since
the
weather
be
not
an
enumerate
activity
event
contract
involve
the
weather
can
trade
because
they
be
not
subject
to
a
public
interest
review
under
cea
section
thus
the
proposal
reliance
on
the
economic
purpose
test
mean
that
exchange
can
list
for
trading
event
contract
such
as
those
involve
weather
that
the
commission
believe
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
which
I
find
untenable
these
be
the
inevitable
result
of
impose
an
economic
purpose
test
on
event
contract
that
be
not
design
for
event
contract
certainly
a
rulemake
proceeding
could
be
appropriate
to
fully
explore
the
economic
attribute
of
event
contract
and
to
consider
how
to
incorporate
such
attribute
into
a
public
interest
review
that
be
tailor
to
the
nature
of
event
contract
but
that
be
not
this
proposal
government
paternalism
third
the
proposal
assert
at
page
50
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
other
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
generally
be
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
change
in
the
price
of
commodity
or
other
financial
asset
or
instrument
limit
the
hedging
and
price
base
utility
of
an
event
contract
involve
such
an
occurrence
but
to
say
that
there
be
limit
to
the
hedge
utility
of
an
event
contract
be
simply
a
statement
that
the
contract
may
not
be
a
particularly
good
hedging
vehicle
market
participant
should
be
permit
to
make
their
own
choice
about
what
financial
product
meet
their
hedging
need
it
be
not
the
cftc
role
to
deny
they
that
choice
altogether
because
we
feel
a
give
product
hedging
value
be
limit
the
economic
purpose
test
be
not
apply
to
category
of
contract
fourth
even
assume
that
the
economic
purpose
test
be
an
appropriate
part
of
a
public
interest
analysis
for
event
contract
it
do
not
support
make
public
interest
determination
for
event
contract
by
category
because
the
commission
apply
its
economic
purpose
test
to
the
term
and
condition
of
individual
contract
the
commission
guideline
no
1
provide
that
contract
term
and
condition
must
be
justify
in
order
for
an
exchange
to
demonstrate
that
it
meet
the
economic
purpose
test
24
the
commission
take
no
shortcut
in
apply
its
subsequently
withdraw
economic
purpose
test
to
future
contract
it
do
not
group
contract
into
category
such
as
all
future
contract
on
wheat
corn
gold
or
silver
in
evaluate
the
public
interest
through
its
economic
purpose
test
rather
the
commission
look
at
each
contract
individual
contract
term
and
condition
to
make
that
determination
if
the
proposal
be
go
to
incorrectly
adopt
that
economic
purpose
test
in
determine
whether
an
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
then
it
should
apply
that
test
the
same
way
2
the
proposal
application
of
other
factor
fall
far
short
of
justify
its
prohibition
entire
category
of
event
contract
aside
from
the
economic
purpose
test
the
proposal
point
to
a
hodgepodge
of
other
factor
to
try
to
justify
prohibit
entire
category
of
event
contract
whose
term
and
condition
the
commission
have
never
see
from
be
trade
on
exchange
but
its
discussion
of
these
factor
be
conjectural
and
without
evidentiary
support
call
into
question
other
contract
that
be
trade
on
regulated
exchange
and
raise
more
question
than
it
answers
take
as
a
whole
the
proposal
fall
far
short
of
justify
the
shortcut
of
prohibit
entire
category
of
event
contract
even
assume
the
commission
have
the
legal
authority
to
do
so
example
of
these
defect
in
the
proposal
abound
but
I
will
focus
here
on
just
a
few
hopelessly
impractical
the
category
of
activity
illegal
under
state
law
demonstrate
the
type
of
problem
inherent
in
determine
that
all
event
contract
in
a
category
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
some
activity
be
illegal
in
some
state
but
not
other
yet
the
proposal
do
not
provide
any
guidance
on
several
obvious
question
be
an
event
contract
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
involve
an
activity
that
be
illegal
in
only
a
single
state
and
if
so
why
or
if
not
then
how
many
state
have
to
declare
an
activity
illegal
before
the
automatic
prohibition
on
event
contract
involve
that
activity
be
trigger
more
than
half
state
comprise
a
certain
percentage
of
the
country
the
problem
be
exacerbate
by
the
proposal
suggestion
that
the
prohibition
of
event
contract
canhinge
on
decision
by
judge
be
this
reference
limit
to
supreme
court
of
the
state
or
would
a
ruling
by
a
low
court
of
a
state
that
a
particular
activity
be
illegal
trigger
an
automatic
determination
that
an
event
contract
involve
that
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
what
if
that
decision
be
appeal
while
I
have
focus
here
on
the
category
of
event
contract
involve
activity
illegal
under
state
law
these
type
of
practical
question
be
a
foreseeable
and
inevitable
result
of
any
determination
that
an
entire
category
of
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
I
recognize
that
a
contract
specific
approach
to
make
public
interest
determination
regard
event
contract
may
be
difficult
and
resource
intensive
for
the
cftc
but
aside
from
my
view
that
a
contract
specific
approach
be
require
by
the
cea
it
also
be
a
well
approach
from
a
policy
perspective
precisely
because
it
would
permit
the
cftc
to
consider
these
practical
question
in
the
context
of
the
specific
circumstance
applicable
to
a
particular
event
contract
we
do
not
get
to
override
a
requirement
under
the
law
because
it
will
be
hard
or
require
more
work
for
us
absolutism
base
on
conjecture
another
defect
in
the
proposal
be
illustrate
by
the
following
at
page
50
generally
speak
the
commission
believe
that
something
of
value
be
stake
or
risk
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
other
or
a
game
or
sic
skill
or
chance
for
entertainment
purpose
in
order
wager
sic
on
the
occurrence
as
such
the
commission
believe
that
contract
involve
such
occurrence
be
likely
to
be
trade
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
use
predominantly
by
speculator
or
participant
not
have
a
commercial
emphasis
add
footnote
omit
or
hedge
interest
these
assertion
be
entirely
conjectural
as
the
proposal
do
not
cite
any
support
for
these
statement
one
can
readily
envision
an
event
contract
involve
whether
a
particular
us
city
will
be
award
the
summer
or
winter
olympic
game
in
a
give
year
which
would
be
use
by
hotel
and
restaurant
owner
as
well
as
other
business
that
would
make
money
if
their
city
get
the
olympic
but
not
if
the
olympic
be
award
elsewhere
such
an
event
contract
would
not
necessarily
be
use
predominantly
for
entertainment
or
speculative
purpose
indeed
the
quote
text
itself
use
word
like
glenerally
speak
and
likely
which
be
an
acknowledgement
that
its
conclusion
be
not
universally
true
a
belief
for
which
no
evidence
be
cite
and
that
be
acknowledge
not
to
be
true
across
the
board
can
not
justify
an
absolutist
determination
that
all
event
contract
involve
an
activity
be
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nor
can
it
justify
a
prohibition
on
trade
all
event
contract
in
that
category
call
into
question
traditional
future
contract
I
agree
that
an
event
contract
involve
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
event
and
that
allow
player
or
coach
to
trade
that
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
consistent
with
its
overreach
the
proposal
also
conclude
that
even
where
the
term
and
condition
of
such
a
contract
prohibit
such
person
from
trade
the
contract
be
nonetheless
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
proposal
state
rationale
at
page
51
be
that
the
athlete
or
coach
would
potentially
have
a
platform
for
example
access
to
medium
combine
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regard
the
team
that
could
be
use
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
the
same
can
be
say
of
many
traditional
exchange
trade
future
contract
for
example
oil
company
or
company
in
the
agricultural
or
metal
sector
or
other
energy
company
also
have
access
to
medium
combine
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regard
the
oil
or
other
industry
that
could
be
use
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
and
yet
exchange
be
permit
to
list
oil
future
for
trade
in
fact
oil
company
be
permit
to
trade
they
the
proposal
offer
no
explanation
for
why
a
possible
incentive
to
spread
misinformation
should
render
all
event
contract
involve
sporting
event
or
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
sporting
event
contrary
to
the
public
interest
when
traditional
future
contract
with
the
same
incentive
be
not
a
contract
specific
public
interest
analysis
by
contrast
could
take
into
account
the
term
and
condition
of
a
particular
event
contract
such
as
whether
athlete
and
coach
can
trade
or
whether
there
be
guardrail
against
the
spread
of
misinformation
to
determine
whether
the
threat
of
misinformation
in
that
contract
be
such
that
it
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
fallacy
concern
the
cftc
regulatory
and
enforcement
role
the
proposal
raise
in
alarmist
tone
the
red
herring
that
sweeping
public
interest
determination
be
necessary
so
that
the
cftc
do
not
get
draw
into
a
regulatory
or
enforcement
role
for
which
it
be
not
well
equipped
for
example
the
proposal
say
at
page
44
that
one
factor
that
may
be
relevant
in
evaluate
whether
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
the
extent
to
which
they
would
draw
the
commission
into
area
outside
of
its
primary
regulatory
remit
other
example
be
1
the
statement
at
page
55
relate
to
event
contract
involve
election
that
the
commission
be
not
task
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
law
and
2
the
statement
in
the
first
sentence
of
footnote
no
127
that
the
oversight
function
in
this
area
regard
election
be
well
reserve
for
other
expert
body
to
be
clear
the
cftc
do
not
administer
oversee
or
regulate
election
sporting
event
gambling
or
any
other
activity
or
event
discuss
in
the
proposal
and
that
will
not
change
with
respect
to
any
event
contract
that
be
find
not
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
the
cftc
would
exercise
its
exact
same
authority
under
the
cea
that
it
do
with
respect
to
all
other
derivative
contract
nor
would
the
cftc
become
some
type
of
election
cop
after
all
the
cftc
have
anti
fraud
and
manipulation
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
future
contract
on
broad
base
security
index
but
that
do
not
mean
the
cftc
regulate
the
security
market
or
that
it
be
task
with
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
security
market
or
enforcement
of
security
law
the
security
and
exchange
commission
sec
do
all
that
the
cftc
similarly
have
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
natural
gas
and
electricity
since
there
be
future
contract
on
those
commodity
but
that
do
not
mean
the
cftc
regulate
the
transmission
of
natural
gas
or
electricity
or
that
it
be
task
with
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
physical
natural

or
power
market
or
enforcement
of
the
natural

act
or
the
federal
power
act
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
do
all
that
the
same
be
true
with
respect
to
an
event
contract
that
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
be
permit
to
trade
on
a
regulated
exchange
as
the
supreme
court
have
state
this
court
case
have
consistently
hold
that
the
use
of
the
word
public
interest
in
a
regulatory
statute
be
not
a
broad
license
to
promote
the
general
public
welfare
rather
the
word
take
meaning
from
the
purpose
of
the
regulatory
legislation
27
if
a
particular
event
contract
involve
election
be
find
not
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
permit
to
trade
the
cftc
would
have
absolutely
no
authority
to
administer
oversee
or
regulate
the
election
that
be
the
subject
of
that
contract
or
to
enforce
any
campaign
finance
law
its
authority
would
extend
only
so
far
as
be
the
case
with
respect
to
all
commodity
underlie
derivative
contract
within
our
jurisdiction
as
provide
by
congress
in
the
cea
why
this
be
important
I
can
understand
why
some
might
ask
you
have
be
plead
for
an
event
contract
rulemake
for
some
time
now
and
here
it
be
so
what
be
the
problem
the
problem
be
this
cftc
rule
already
prohibit
the
listing
and
trading
of
any
event
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
as
I
explain
in
my
kalshi
dissent
statement
rule
contradict
the
statute
cea
section
grant
the
commission
discretion
to
determine
whether
an
exchange
event
contract
that
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cftc
rule
a
by
contrast
provide
that
an
exchange
shall
not
list
for
an
enumerate
activity
emphasis
add
read
literally
rule
trade
a
contract
that
involve
a
remove
entirely
the
flexibility
that
congress
grant
the
commission
to
evaluate
exchange
event
contract
from
a
public
interest
perspective
28
rather
than
fix
this
problem
though
the
proposal
double
down
on
it
by
make
categorical
public
interest
determination
in
advance
the
proposal
would
impermissibly
transform
the
two
step
analysis
that
congress
provide
for
event
contract
into
a
single
step
it
would
transmogrify
the
discretion
that
congress
give
the
commission
to
determine
that
an
event
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
into
a
mandate
that
it
do
so
the
proposal
actually
be
quite
candid
in
acknowledge
that
it
would
re
write
cea
section
c
it
state
at
page
38
if
as
propose
rule
be
amend
to
include
a
categorical
public
interest
determination
with
respect
to
contract
involve
each
of
the
enumerate
activity
the
commission
would
not
go
forward
undertake
a
contract
specific
public
interest
analysis
as
part
of
a
review
rather
the
focus
of
any
such
review
would
be
to
evaluate
whether
the
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
in
which
case
it
may
not
be
list
for
trade
if
congress
have
intend
that
every
event
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibit
from
trade
it
could
have
provide
for
such
a
step
process
in
cea
section
but
it
do
not
do
that
and
instead
provide
that
even
if
an
event
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
the
commission
can
not
prohibit
the
contract
without
exercise
its
discretion
in
a
second
step
of
determine
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
can
short
circuit
the
process
that
congress
establish
by
determine
that
an
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
advance
and
without
know
the
contract
term
and
condition
simply
because
that
make
thing
easy
for
the
agency
grant
the
proposal
make
categorical
public
interest
determination
only
for
the
activity
enumerate
in
cea
section
I
admit
that
I
be
not
go
to
lose
sleep
over
a
determination
that
all
event
contract
involve
terrorism
assassination
and
war
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
this
be
where
the
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
arrive
while
this
proposal
only
address
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
it
set
the
precedent
for
how
the
commission
can
handle
event
contract
involve
other
activity
that
it
determine
be
similar
to
enumerate
activity
too
if
the
proposal
be
adopt
as
final
then
at
any
time
in
the
future
the
commission
could
determine
that
other
activity
be
similar
to
enumerate
activity
and
could
then
determine
that
every
event
contract
involve
that
activity
be
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
prohibit
from
trading
regardless
of
its
particular
term
and
condition
and
give
all
the
deficiency
in
this
proposal
categorical
public
interest
determination
discuss
above
that
appear
to
be
a
low
bar
to
clear
portion
of
the
proposal
be
inaccurate
or
extremely
weak
or
make
no
sense
the
fact
that
certain
portion
of
the
proposal
be
inaccurate
extremely
weak
or
simply
make
no
sense
suggest
that
it
either
be
hastily
prepare
or
be
motivate
primarily
by
the
sheer
hatred
that
the
commission
seem
to
bear
towards
event
contract
here
be
a
few
example
proposal
say
at
page
44
that
the
public
good
be
a
relevant
factor
for
consideration
in
an
evaluation
of
whether
an
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
make
no
sense
that
the
commission
should
consider
the
public
good
in
evaluate
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
be
tautological
the
public
good
and
the
public
interest
mean
the
same
thing
the
proposal
statement
at
page

that
in
the
colloquy
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
discuss
the
commission
authority
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
commodity
future
modernization
act
of
2000
cfma
to
prevent
trading
that
be
contrary

be
incorrect
senator

do
not
discuss
the

pre

senator

reference
it
in
ask
a

but
senator

the

do
not
talk
about
it
in
fact
she
do
not
even
mention
the
cfma
no
49
cite
the
cftc
reauthorization
act
of
2019
as
support
for
the
proposal
view
that
an
erroneous
reference
to
a
non
existent
cea
section
in
cea
section
be
intend
by
congress
to
refer
to
cea
section
instead
since
the
bill
include
a
provision
to
replace
the
reference
to
section
with
a
reference
to
section
but
an
amendment
in
a
bill
introduce
in
a
subsequent
congress
nine
year
later
shed
no
light
on
what
be
intend
by
the
congress
that
enact
the
statutory
provision
in
question
especially
when
the
reference
bill
be
not
enact
and
nothing
have
happen
on
it
during
the
ensue
five
year
vi
certain
implementation
timeline
provision
in
the
proposal
be
ill
advise
implementation
timeline
as
discuss
above
I
do
not
support
the
proposal
to
determine
that
all
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
if
the
commission
decide
to
do
so
I
oppose
apply
that
determination
to
contract
that
be
already
list
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
final
rule
amendment
in
the
federal
register
it
be
my
hope
that
there
would
be
few
such
contract
but
for
any
contract
that
would
be
impact
the
proposal
be
pollyanaish
in
its
rosy
view
that
a
60
day
implementation
period
for
these
contract
will
minimize
any
market
disruption
that
might
be
cause
by
the
rule
amendment
for
one
thing
give
the
proposal
repeat
emphasis
at
page
29
33
and
54
that
its
example
of
activity
that
constitute
gaming
under
the
propose
definition
be
non
exclusive
I
be
dubious
that
exchange
and
trader
necessarily
will
know
exactly
which
exist
event
contract
the
commission
believe
be
now
suddenly
prohibit
beyond
that
this
aspect
of
the
proposal
be
fundamentally
unfair
at
any
time
during
the
13
year
since
its
adoption
of
rule
the
commission
could
have
conclude
that
a
give
event
contractnvolve
an
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
exchange
and
market
participant
that
have
list
and
trade
an
event
contract
in
good
faith
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
commission
have
not
determine
the
contract
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
not
pay
the
price
literally
for
the
commission
inaction
by
have
to
halt
trading
in
a
fix
amount
of
time
because
the
commission
have
finally
get
around
to
it
this
would
be
the
antithesis
of
good
government
accordingly
I
do
not
believe
that
any
rule
amendment
finalize
as
part
of
this
rulemaking
should
apply
to
an
event
contract
that
be
list
and
available
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
their
publication
in
the
federal
register
vii
conclusion
rather
than
undertake
a
rulemaking
process
to
do
the
hard
work
of
build
a
framework
for
evaluate
event
contract
pursuant
to
cea
section
the
commission
squander
the
14
year
since
that
provision
be
enact
as
part
of
the
dodd
frank
act
while
the
commission
be
now
propose
an
event
contract
rulemake
that
hard
work
still
have
yet
to
be
do
instead
the
commission
be
skip
right
over
build
a
proper
framework
and
simply
propose
to
prohibit
contract
outright
this
result
seems
preordain
give
the
hostility
that
the
commission
have
display
toward
event
contract
since
the
enactment
of
the
dodd
frank
act
this
proposal
rubber
stamp
the
commission
two
prior
order
find
propose
event
contract
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
addition
it
continue
the
tradition
of
stretch
a
solitary
cryptic
colloquy
to
form
the
basis
for
evaluate
whether
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
through
the
economic
purpose
test
that
1
be
not
mention
in
the
statute
2
have
previously
be
withdraw
due
to
congress
repeal
of
the
cea
provision
it
implement
3
be
not
design
for
this
type
of
contract
and
4
many
event
contract
due
to
their
structure
likely
will
be
unable
to
meet
and
now
the
proposal
go
even
far
adopt
an
overly
broad
definition
of
gaming
and
declare
entire
category
of
event
contract
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
sight
unseen
the
commission
legal
authority
to
make
such
determination
by
category
be
questionable
at
good
that
it
be
inappropriate
from
a
policy
perspective
can
not
reasonably
be
question
the
proposal
flatly
contravene
congress
direction
in
the
cea
that
the
cftc
promote
responsible
innovation
29
the
unmistakable
take
away
for
exchange
be
not
to
expend
resource
develop
an
innovative
event
contract
because
the
commission
will
go
to
great
length
to
find
that
it
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibit
it
from
trade
30
I
want
to
be
very
clear
my
dissent
should
not
be
take
as
an
endorsement
of
the
wisdom
of
event
contract
generally
or
of
any
event
contract
in
particular
rather
it
reflect
my
application
of
congress
direction
to
the
commission
in
cea
section
whatever
we
may
think
of
event
contract
we
can
not
re
write
the
cea
to
claim
an
authority
that
congress
do
not
give
we
because
we
have
be
derelict
in
apply
the
authority
that
congress
do
give
we
nor
should
we
be
prohibit
an
event
contract
without
a
proper
showing
that
it
involve
an
enumerate
activity
and
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
base
on
the
application
of
well
define
factor
to
