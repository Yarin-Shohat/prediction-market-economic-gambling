condition
have
change
in

and
the
concern
the

express
in

have
not
materialize

run
a

outcome
with
no
observed
ill
effect
on

integrity
in
addition
the
hedging
and
price
base
utility
of
these
contract
be
clear
now
than
they
be
in
2012
for
an
example

substantial
academic
research
investment
analysis
and
financial
institution
publication
have
address
how
contract
like
these
can
be
use
both
for
hedging
purpose
and
as
the
basis
for
price
a
commercial
transaction
involve
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
this
demonstrate
that
these
contract
satisfy
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
employ
in
its
nadex
order
economic
purpose
event
contract
on
congressional
control
serve
an
important
role
in
risk
management
specifically
these
contract
would
allow
individual
to
be
able
to
reduce
their
risk
exposure
to
change
in
the
probability
of
different
party
gain
control
of
government
many
change
in
taxis
subsidy
and
program
design
be
favor
by
one
party
or
another
and
be
thus
more
likely
to
become
law
if
one
party
be
in
power
versus
another
a
small
scale
supplier
for
a
semiconducte
foundry
may
expect
to
see
more
order
under
a
government
that
have
signal
through
their
campaign
speech
and
policy
document
that
they
will
prioritize
build
a
domestic
semi
conduct
supply
chain
an
electric
car
dealer
may
expect
to
see
few
order
under
a
government
who
may
not
re
authorize
subsidy
for
purchase
while
the
specific
policy
that
become
law
can
not
be
know
with
certainty
there
remain
a
change
in
risk
and
a
change
in
risk
be
what
hedge
instrument
be
design
to
manage
these
contract
can
help
those
who
face
disproportionate
risk
offload
the
risk
to
those
who
can
hedging
be
not
the
only
economic
value
that
these
contract
provide
these
contract
can
also
serve
as
the
foundation
to
price
other
good
and
service
the
price
of
commodity
future
be
base
on
market
expectation
of
supply
and
demand
for
relate
good
asset
or
service
in
the
near
future
both
supply
and
demand
can
depend
in
part
on
government
action
farm
bill
energy
bill
appropriating
direct
government
payment
to
individual
and
many
other
congressional
action
can
have
clear
effect
on
the
price
of
commodity
it
not
enough
for
commodity
trader
to
wait
until
a
bill
become
law
to
respondthe
most
accurate
pricing
will
reflect
the
probability
of
various
policy
change
as
well
and
it
be
impossible
to
accurately
forecast
the
probability
of
a
bill
pass
without
know
the
probability
of
political
control
of
congress
this
explain
the
considerable
amount
of
academic
article
news
report
and
industry
analysis
discuss
the
implication
of
various
election
or
even
change
in
election
polling
for
commodity
price
for
one
representative
example
see
here
but
know
the
probability
of
a
give
party
control
congress
implicate
more
than
just
the
price
of
financial
asset
it
also
impact
the
way
business
make
decision
for
instance
a
firm
may
not
invest
in
create
a
program
that
rely
on
specific
tax
break
if
they
be
uncertain
about
whether

in

the
rise
of

can
result
in

see
the

presidential

as

help
improve
this

through

mechanism
first
they
introduce
competition
into
the

as
the

now
have
an
alternative
if
prediction

consistently
outperform
poll
as
some
historical
evidence
suggest
they
might

then
the
medium
might
opt
to
use
they
instead
as
a
result
the
demand
for
any
give
polling
company
will
decline
and
they
thus
have
an
incentive
to
invest
resource
in
solve
many
of
the
issue
that
have
bedevil
polling
in
the
past
second
prediction
market
can
incorporate
information
fast
and
more
comprehensively
than
poll
and
statistical
model
after
a
crucial
event
polling
company
must
wait
several
day
to
conduct
a
sufficient
sample
size
to
report
their
effect
and
statistical
model
must
wait
until
a
sufficient
number
of
these
post
event
poll
have
be
conduct
in
order
to
update
in
contrast
because
non
hedge
prediction
market
trader
be
highly
incentivized
to
closely
follow
the
news
and
gain
an
edge
over
their
fellow
trader
they
will
react
as
soon
as
the
event
occur
offer
a
more
real
time
analysis
of
the
state
of
the
race
as
a
result
medium
company
who
wish
to
report
on
the
effect
of
the
event
and
who
be
unlikely
to
wait
the
one
to
three
week
for
enough
poll
to
come
in
can
rely
on
a
validate
market
base
approach
instead
of
the
prognostication
of
individual
pundit
who
tend
to
have
a
much
bad
track
record
than
even
a
simple
polling
average
while
medium
company
may
benefit
from
have
more
accurate
information
the
true
beneficiary
be
the
broad
public
who
will
be
well
inform
as
a
result
of
the
introduction
of
these
contract
into
the
marketplace
election
integrity
in
the
last
decade
plus
million
of
contract
on
political
contract
have
trade
and
election
trading
have
pick
up
in
volume
on
overseas
exchange
especially
those
in
britain
notwithstanding
this
trend
I
be
aware
of
no
datum
or
study
suggest
it
have
have
an
impact
on
election
integrity
this
should
assuage
commission
concern
about
impact
on
election
themselves
conclusion
in
short
election
market
be
a
powerful
tool
for
hedge
price
base
and
promote
the
public
interest
they
represent
the
kind
of
innovation
that
the
cftc
should
embrace
and
I
would
encourage
they
to
allow
the
propose
contract
to
proceed
very
truly
