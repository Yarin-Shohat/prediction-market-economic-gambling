thank

concern
event

in
certain
exclude
commodity
the
cftc
be
propose
amendment
to
far
specify
type
of
event
contract
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
or
the
act
and
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
that
they
may
not
be
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clear
on
or
through
a
cftc
entity
among
other
thing
the
cftc
propose
to
far
specify
the
type
of
event
contract
that
involve
game
the
cftc
also
propose
to
amend
certain
language
in
its
event
contract
rule
to
far
align
with
statutory
text
and
to
make
certain
technical
change
to
its
event
contract
rule
in
order
to
enhance
clarity
and
organization
I
strongly
support
your
proposal
which
codify
the
cftc
view
around
what
event
contract
may
be
impermissible
gaming
under
the
cea
congressional
intent
section
of
the
dodd
frank
act
amend
section
5c
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
by
add
the
following
under
new
concern
event
contract
which
state
that
event
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
exclude
commodity
that
be
base
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
level
of
a
commodity
describe
in
section
by
a
designate
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreement
contract
or
transaction
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreement
contract
or
transaction
I
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
you
propose
to
define
gaming
in
new
as
the
staking
or
risk
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
I
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
other
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involve
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitor
in
one
or
more
contest
or
game
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
furthermore
propose
state
that
gaming
include
but
be
not
limit
to
the
staking
or
risk
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
include
an
election
or
election
an
award
contest
or
a
game
in
which
one
or
more
athlete
compete
or
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
I
strongly
support
these
proposal
which
specify
the
type
of
event
contract
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
and
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
will
increase
regulatory
clarity
and
reduce
the
likelihood
that
a
register
entity
would
list
for
trade
an
event
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
lack
of
definite
economic
rationale
certain
event
contract
may
serve
a
useful
economic
purpose
for
example
weather
derivative
cover
snowfall
or
hurricane
offer
protection
against
actual
suffer
loss
entity
can
use
such
derivative
in
risk
management
to
protect
against
actual
suffer
loss
cause
by
adverse
or
unexpected
weather
condition
I
would
argue
that
contract
that
be
base
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
include
an
election
or
election
offer
no
such
reliable
or
predictable
protection
against
actual
suffer
loss
whilst
weather
be
purely
random
political
contest
include
an
election
or
election
and
their
ramification
be
base
on
future
human
decision
which
can
vary
but
be
certainly
not
random
I
must
say
that
I
find
the
concept
of
use
such
contract
to
protect
against
actual
suffer
loss
cause
by
political
contest
include
an
election
or
election
to
be
quite
perverse
and
not
in
line
with
the
public
interest
role
of
the
cftc
I
agree
with
cftc
chair
rostin
behnam
statement
about
the
impact
that
political
event
contract
could
have
on
the
role
of
the
cftc
during
an
odd
lot
podcast
behnam
state
that
imagine
a
situation
where
we
have
allege
fraud
or
allege
manipulation
of
an
election
and
someone
come
to
the
cftc
and
say
you
know
you
have
a
contract
list
on
an
election
in
x
district
in
y
state
and
we
believe
there
be
fraud
because
of
hardware
software
news
you
name
it
you
need
to
police
that
fraud
so
without
be
too
indirect
what
I
try
to
say
be
the
cftc
could
end
up
be
an
election
cop
and
I
do
think
that
what
congress
mean
or
intend
for
we
to
do
1
I
agree
with
these
statement
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
for
the
cftc
to
assume
the
role
of
election
cop
therefore
I
would
strongly
recommend
and
support
that
the
cftc
should
forbid
all
such
contract
your
sincerely
chris
