commission
regulation
dear
chairman
and
commissioner
I
be
write
in
support
of
kalshi
application
to
run
prediction
market
on
political
outcome
I
will
argue
that
prediction
market
offer
significant
public
benefit
with
minimal
downside
I
be
a
professor
of
economic
at
dartmouth
and
a
significant
component
of
my
research
agenda
involve
prediction
market
my
work
include
both
study
of
prediction
market
themselves
and
research
that
use
prediction
market
price
as
an
input
to
an
analysis
I
attach
a
bibliography
to
the
end
of
this
letter
I
have
find
political
prediction
market
to
be
particularly
useful
in
track
the
arrival
of
political
news
that
influence
other
asset
price
allow
one
to
understand
the
economic
effect
of
political
outcome
example
include
prospective
analysis
of
the
expect
impact
of
the
2003
iraq
war
wolfer
and
zitzewitz
2009
and
the
2016
presidential
election
wolfer
and
zitzewitz
2016
and
2018
as
well
as
retrospective
analysis
of
other
presidential
and
congressional
election
snowberg
wolfer
and
zitzewitz
2007a
and
2007b
prediction
market
on
policy
outcome
such
as
the
corporate
tax
rate
also
inform
my
analysis
of
the
post
event
evolution
of
belief
about
the
consequence
of
the
2016
election
and
brexit
vote
fisman
and
zitzewitz
2019
in
the
course
of
this
research
I
speak
with
numerous
financial
market
participant
who
find
prediction
market
price
a
useful
input
into
their
decision
making
by
aggregate
information
about
political
risk
political
prediction
market
allow
investor
to
focus
on
other
issue
potentially
reduce
asymmetric
information
and
improve
market
liquidity
research
on
emerge
market
corporate
bond
market
have
find
an
analogous
role
for
sovereign
bond
dittmar
and
yuan
2008
in
order
for
market
to
be
useful
people
have
to
trade
in
they
if
trader
be
rational
and
only
participate
out
of
a
profit
motive
unsubsidized
market
will
unravel
as
the
less
informed
investor
exit
trader
need
to
be
willing
to
participate
even
when
they
should
rationally
expect
to
lose
money
three
reason
why
they
might
do
so
are
entertainment
overconfidence
and
hedging
wolfer
and
zitzewitz
2006
market
need
to
reach
a
certain
scale
before
they
be
useful
for
hedging
and
this
will
likely
never
happen
unless
we
tolerate
market
that
be
fun
on
topic
about
which
investor
find
it
easy
to
be
overconfident
two
of
the
three
firm
who
run
the
corporate
prediction
market
I
study
in
cowgill
and
zitzewitz
2015
include
fun
market
participant
tell
we
that
they
often
start
trade
for
the
fun
market
but
stay
for
the
serious
one
these
force
be
or
be
clearly
also
at
work
at
tradesport
intrade
betfair
and
predictit
market
on
topic
such
as
sport
or
the
number
of
time
president
trump
tweet
arguably
do
not
provide
information
on
a
topic
of
broad
direct
economic
relevance
yet
they
be
often
the
killer
app
that
bring
trader
to
the
market
that
do
political
prediction
market
however
be
the
rare
combination
they
be
economically
useful
but
also
fun
to
trade
in
and
on
topic
that
inspire
strong
and
sometimes
overconfident
opinion
so
the
case
for
allow
kalshi
to
run
they
be
two
fold
they
will
both
provide
useful
information
in
themselves
as
well
as
likely
augment
the
liquidity
of
the
many
other
useful
market
kalshi
be
run
on
topic
such
as
covid
climate
change
and
air
transportation
congestion
finally
your
question
13
raise
concern
about
politically
motivated
manipulation
of
the
price
in
the
market
as
hanson
and
oprea
2009
correctly
argue
manipulation
encourage
entry
to
trade
against
it
in
the
long
run
this
improve
liquidity
and
the
accuracy
of
price
moreover
the
long
run
often
arrive
soon
than
one
might
expect
as
past
suspect
episode
of
manipulation
have
involve
relatively
quick
reversion
of
price
see
rhode
and
strumpf
2008
consistent
with
the
lab
experiment
of
hanson
oprea
and
porter
2006
in
summary
I
strongly
support
kalshi
proposal
and
hope
it
and
other
proposal
like
it
be
approve
