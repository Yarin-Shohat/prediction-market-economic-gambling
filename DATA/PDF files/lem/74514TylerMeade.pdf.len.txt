dear

together
with
its
subsidiary
gemini
respectfully
submit
the
follow
comment
on
propose
rule
pr
8907
24
proposal
which
pertain
to
the
regulation
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
commission
pursuant
to
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
we
urge
the
commission
to
withdraw
the
proposal
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
proposal
be
contrary
to
the
statutory
framework
of
the
cea
and
as
a
substantive
matter
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
there
be
numerous
problem
with
the
proposal
but
we
focus
on
the
aspect
of
the
proposal
that
would
define
ipso
facto
all
event
contract
involve
gaming
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
particular
we
highlight
the
adverse
impact
that
this
rule
would
have
on
prediction
market
include
prediction
market
use
to
forecast
election
first
the
proposal
ignore
the
framework
congress
define
in
the
cea
the
cea
by
its
plain
text
prohibit
a
designate
contract
market
dcm
from
use
the
self
certification
process
to
list
an
event
contract
if
that
contract
be
within
one
of
five
enumerate
activity
and
if
the
commission
determine
that
list
that
specific
event
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
see
7
thus
the
statuterequire
the
commission
to
evaluate
event
contract
on
a
case
by
case
basis
there
be
nothing
in
the
statute
include
in
the
dodd
frank
provision
relate
to
event
contract
state
that
all
event
contract
in
the
enumerate
activity
be
by
definition
contrary
to
the
public
interest
89
fr
at
48978
in
this
regard
we
note
that
the
cftc
have
state
the
commission
interpret
cea
section
to
authorize
categorical
public
interest
determination
if
the
commission
determine
that
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
or
prescribe
similar
activity
be
as
a
category
contrary
to
the
public
interest
respectfully
this
be
just
wrong
and
the
proposal
be
base
on
an
overly
expansive
erroneous
reading
of
the
cea
put
simply
the
text
just
do
not
support
the
commission
interpretation
quote
above
if
the
proposal
be
adopt
the
commission
would
be
abandon
the
task
assign
by
congress
to
evaluate
individual
self
certification
on
their
own
individual
merit
such
an
interpretation
and
approach
would
immediately
be
vulnerable
to
challenge
under
the
supreme
court
recent
decision
in
loper
bright
enterprise
raimondo

2024
reject
the
concept
of
deference
to
agency
determination
of
ambiguous
statutory
language
second
the
proposal
give
insufficient
weight
to
the
value
and
significance
of
prediction
market
to
the
public
interest
such
market
have
be
employ
for
decade
and
have
prove
extremely
reliable
tool
for
forecast
future
event
this
be
true
for
contested
event
like
election
but
also
for
matter
like
the
spread
of
infectious
disease
pattern
of
migration
and
weather
among
many
other
one
way
to
improve
the
accuracy
of
prediction
market
be
to
allow
people
to
put
something
of
value
a
stake
behind
their
prediction
so
that
they
achieve
a
return
if
their
prediction
prove
correct
put
simply
people
put
more
effort
into
make
accurate
prediction
when
they
have
something
to
gain
by
do
so
a
related
point
be
that
the
accuracy
of
prediction
market
improve
as
more
people
participate
the
cftc
be
appropriately
concerned
with
situation
where
market
be
susceptible
to
manipulation
it
be
also
true
and
the
cftc
have
state
publicly
that
the
susceptibility
to
manipulation
go
down
as
the
liquidity
of
market
increase
thus
the
cftc
should
not
be
take
action
that
will
discourage
participation
in
any
legitimate
market
third
prediction
market
for
election
be
already
a
global
reality
right
now
people
around
the
world
can
bet
on
election
outcome
while
americans
themselves
be
leave
out
of
the
process
these
market
be
some
fringe
activity
they
be
be
take
seriously
major
news
outlet
frequently
cite
prediction
market
odd
alongside
of
and
in
some
case
instead
of
traditional
poll
it
become
clear
that
these
market
be
an
important
part
of
how
we
discuss
and
understand
election
citizen
should
be
able
to
participate
in
something
that
already
shape
the
conversation
about
their
own
electoral
process
fourth
the
proposal
appear
to
we
to
be
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem
the
notice
of
propose
rulemake
89
fr
48968
notice
do
not
provide
any
reasonable
basis
for
conclude
that
prediction
market
relate
to
election
or
other
unknown
event
be
in
any
way
a
problem
or
that
anyone
have
be
harm
by
the
existence
of
such
market
there
be
no
evidence
cite
of
any
actual
harm
to
anyone
indeed
what
be
cite
a
mere
two
speculative
article
note
in
footnote
125
of
the
notice
fall
far
short
of
the
sort
of
analysis
the
cftc
should
be
conduct
indeed
the
proposal
do
not
satisfy
the
commission
obligation
to
fully
evaluate
and
account
for
the
cost
and
benefit
to
market
participant
of
prohibit
particular
event
contract
see
7
s
fifth
we
be
concerned
that
the
proposal
be
an
example
of
the
commission
pick
winner
and
loser
if
adopt
the
proposal
would
clearly
benefit
some
participant
in
relevant
market
to
the
detriment
of
other
we
highlight
two
example
below
1
the
proposal
plainly
benefit
exist
market
research
and
political
polling
firm
by
exclude
direct
competition
from
prediction
market
the
cftc
offer
no
justification
for
this
choice
nor
explain
why
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
favor
a
certain
way
of
gather
information
about
the
public
expectation
of
future
event
over
another
moreover
we
believe
that
traditional
poll
be
extremely
susceptible
to
manipulation
very
likely
more
so
than
prediction
market
if
the
cftc
be
go
to
determine
for
example
that
a
poll
of
a
few
thousand
self
identify
potential
voter
who
answer
a
call
from
an
unknown
telephone
numbe
be
somehow
superior
and
more
in
the
public
interest
than
the
output
of
a
liquid
prediction
market
it
should
provide
evidence
to
justify
that
conclusion
2
the
proposal
favor
traditional
financial
market
and
impede
innovation
gemini
operate
in
the
crypto
space
as
oppose
to
the
tradfi
market
in
recent
year
the
use
of
decentralized
prediction
market
in
the
crypto
universe
have
grow
significantly
people
use
they
and
trust
they
because
of
the
wisdom
of
crowd
with
skin
in
the
game
we
firmly
believe
that
prediction
market
be
so
effective
because
they
combine
two
of
humanity
most
potent
innovation
market
asthe
information
aggregator
and
financial
incentive
as
behavior
motivator
cftc
should
be
encourage
innovation
like
this
not
restrict
they
since
its
founding
in
2014
gemini
have
advocate
for
sound
responsible
and
thoughtful
regulation
we
stand
by
that
commitment
in
this
instance
however
we
believe
that
the
proposal
miss
that
mark
and
be
a
mistake
the
cftc
should
withdraw
the
proposal
we
would
be
happy
to
discuss
these
important
issue
far
with
the
commission
or
the
staff
at
any
time
respectfully
