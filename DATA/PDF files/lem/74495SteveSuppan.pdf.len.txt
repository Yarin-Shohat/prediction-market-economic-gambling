the
definition
of

in

we
propose
that
the

consider
further

to
anticipate
possible
regulatory
evasion
of
prohibit

for
example
should
the
current
prohibition
on

need
further

a
footnote
to
this
sentence
explain
the
commission
clarify
however
that
it
believe
that
cyberattack
and
other
act
of
cyberterrorism
constitute
terrorism
and
in
some
case
war
and
be
also
likely
to
constitute
activity
that
be
unlawful
under

while
iatp
appreciate
this
clarification
preamble
although
crucial
for
understand
an
agency
reasoning
about
a
regulation
be
not
legally
enforceable
the
federal
definition
of
terrorism
do
not
anticipate
that
the
intention
of
a
terroristic
attack
could
be
economic
gain
or
disruption
the
commission
technology
advisory
committee
cybersecurity
subcommittee
will
soon
be
present
its
report
and
recommendation
on
cybersecurity
and
financial
market
before
the
commission
finalize
its
definition
for
the
revised
it
should
review
the
report
to
help
it
decide
whether
the
risk
to
market
of
cyberattack
and
cybersecurity
failure
merit
an
amend
definition
of
war
and
terrorism
in
the
rule
or
whether
the
footnoted
clarification
will
suffice
in
theory
the
statute
and
the
inclusion
of
similar
activity
to
those
explicitly
prohibit
as
involve
in

might
be
consider
as
an
adequate
firewall
against
such
event

regulatory
evasion
of
prohibit
enumerate
activity
however
we
live
in
a
perilous
jurisprudential
landscape
in
which
long
stand
precedent
in
the
delegation
of
statutory
authority
and

law
be
in
jeopardy
therefore
we
contend
the
commission
should
consider
define
war
and
terrorism
as
prohibit
activity
involve
in
the
listing
of

if
the

together
with

will
supply
the

guidance
that
fia

the
npr
describe
a
two
step
general
methodology
to
determine
whether
a
propose
event
contract
or
swap
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
first
the
commission
must
assess
whether
a
contract
in
a
specify
exclude
commodity
an
activity
enumerate
in
cea
section
each
an
enumerate
activity
or
other
similar
activity
as
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
prescribe
similar
activity
if
the
commission
determine
that
the
contract
involve
such
activity
the
commission
must
assess
whether
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
fr
48971
although
this
methodology
be
clear
and
straightforward
its
application
to
each
propose
event
contract
would
be
time
and
resource
intensive
both
for
the
dcm
research
and
design
the
propose
contract
and
commission
staff
review
it
accord
to
the
two
step
process
therefore
the
preamble
and
the
amend
rule
advise
dcms
of
which
type
of
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
such
as
war
and
gaming
that
the
commission
will
determine
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
ar
e
prohibit
iatp
agree
with
the
commission
reasoning
and
conclusion
that
the
amend
rule
will
both
assist
dcm
business
planning
and
contract
design
while
conserve
commission
staff
resource
from
repeat
review
of
individual
contract
that
may
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
fr
48972
nevertheless
despite
this
two
step
methodology
for
type
of
event
contract
the
preamble
allow
that
the
commission
may
have
to
review
individual
contract
in
case
where
the
contract
characteristic
involve
with

do
not
clearly
identify
it
as
a

this

comment

remark
on

the
