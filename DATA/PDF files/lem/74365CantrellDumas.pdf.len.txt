further

this

utility

this
be

which
be
more
likely
to
be
use
for

rather
than
for
legitimate

or

purpose
the
cftc
view
that
these

be
trade
primarily
for
entertainment
with
participant
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a

be

correct
such

tool
even
though
some

might
experience
more
direct

consequence
from

the

believe

compare

participant

who

this
distinction
be
crucial
for
maintain
market
integrity
moreover
individual
or
entity
with
a
direct
economic
stake
in
these
event
might
have
access
to
inside
information
or
influence
raise
concern
about
market
manipulation
for
example
a
professional
athlete
or
coach
could
use
privileged
information
about
their
team
to
trade
event
contract
or
manipulate
the
market
the
cftc
effort
to
address
these
manipulation
risk
be
necessary
and
appropriate
also
contract
classify
as
game
typically
lack
an
underlie
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transaction
to
provide
reliable
price
information
instead
they
rely
on
unregulated
and
opaque
source
increase
the
risk
of
manipulation
and
decrease
the
ability
of

and
the
cftc
to
detect
such
activity
this
lack
of
transparency
and
regulation
be
a
significant
concern
allow
such

could
also
blur
the
line
between

potentially
mislead
retail

about
the

of

this
could
improperly
suggest
that

that

indicate
that

sector
than
commonly
believe
this
unpredictability
provide
yet
more
evidence
that
political
event
contract
be
unreliable
and
inappropriate
for
hedge
purpose
from
a
regulatory
perspective
the
cftc
mandate
be
to
oversee
commodity
and
derivative
market
make
sure
they
function
effectively
for
hedging
and
price
discovery
that
ensure
that
vitally
important
commodity
be
available
to
the
american
people
when
they
want
they
in
the
amount
they
want
and
at
price
that
reasonably
reflect
supply
and
demand
whether
the
cftc

that
job

poorly
impact

from

bread
and
peanut
butter
in

sandwich
gas
for
car

cotton
for
shirt
and

and
sugar
in
almost
everything
in
contrast
political
event
contract
offer
no
such
significant
hedging
benefit
and
do
not
contribute
to
price
discovery
instead
they
represent
speculative
gambling
that
fall
outside
the
cftc
regulatory
expertise
experience
and
purview
and
will
detract
the
cftc
from
its
primary
mission
by
focus
on
commodity
that
impact
everyday
life
such
as
agricultural
product
and
energy
resource
the
cftc
can
continue
to
serve
and
protect
the
american
people
additionally
the
cftc
be
already
underfunde
and
struggle
to
fulfill
its
current
statutory
mandate
introduce
significant
new
and
unrelated
duty
such
as
oversee
political
event
contract
would
far
strain
its
limited
resource
this
shift
in
focus
go
against
congressional
intent
and
undermine
the
agency
ability
to
regulate
essential
commodity
and
derivative
market
effectively
the
cftc
should
prioritize
its
exist
responsibility
to
ensure
the
stability
and
integrity
of
market
that
directly
affect
the
daily
life
of

rather
