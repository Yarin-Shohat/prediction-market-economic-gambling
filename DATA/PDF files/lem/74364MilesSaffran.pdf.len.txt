on
the
recently
propose
rule
regard
event
contract
railbird
be
a
current
applicant
for
dcm
registration
as
an
event
contract
market
therefore
this
propose
rule
be
of
particular
interest
to
we
after
review
and
carefully
consider
the
proposal
railbird
offer
comment
on
the
follow
issue
1
the
definition
of
gaming
2
the
public
interest
consideration
3
appendix
e
and
4
the
specific
question
ask
by
the
commission
1
the
definition
of
gaming
be
overly
broad
and
would
restrict
legitimate
contract
from
be
list
for
trading
we
would
like
to
thank
the
commission
for
its
attempt
to
clarify
the
term
of
however
the
propose
rule
go
beyond
clarification
result
in
the
potential
prohibition
of
any
contract
that
bear
any
relation
to
a
sport
the
propose
rule
include
in
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
be
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
emphasis
add
while
we
understand
the
commission
belief
that
event
contract
should
not
act
as
a
proxy
for
gamble
a
term
the
commission
interchange
with
gaming
there
be
potential
event
contract
that
may
involve
a
sporting
event
but
be
not
base
on
the
ultimate
outcome
of
a
game
the
commission
do
not
cite
any
exist
law
to
establish
that
prong
iv
meet
current
law
relate
to
gaming
accord
to
the
propose
release
at
48975
the
first
three
example
of
what
gaming
be
have
be
recognize
as
gambling
bet
or
wager
under
relevant
state
and
federal
statute
this
sentence
make
clear
that
prong
iv
of
the
definition
have
not
be
recognize
as
gaming
even
if
the
prior
three
have
be
2
the
public
interest
consideration
prohibit
contract
base
on
a
predetermined
finding
as
against
the
public
interest
base
on
their
subject
rather
than
on
a
review
of
their
actual
term
create
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
result
in
addition
to
an
overly
broad
definition
of
game
the
cftc
provide
no
analysis
as
to
why
all
contract
that
involve
gaming
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
give
the
extreme
overbreadth
of
the
definition
of
game
the
cftc
conclusion
that
all
contract
that
involve
gaming
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
particularly
concern
the
cftc
have
not
review
the
term
of
contract
or
assess
the
hedge
utility
of
whole
class
of
contract
so
they
do
not
have
any
reason
basis
to
conclude
that
they
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
prohibit
any
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
an
event
relate
to
a
game
the
commission
foreclose
the
possibility
of
legitimate
hedge
opportunity
for
individual
and
small
business
who
may
not
have
another
mean
to
do
so
for
example
a
stadium
vendor
may
want
to
hedge
the
possibility
of
cancellation
or
low
attendance
of
event
at
the
venue
where
it
do
business
under
the
propose
rule
if
the
event
be
a
football
game
the
vendor
may
not
hedge
its
risk
but
that
same
vendor
may
hedge
the
same
risk
if
the
event
be
a
concert
similarly
weather
base
event
contract
have
exist
for
many
year
under
the
propose
rule
a
weather
contract
for
the
amount
of
snowfall
at
bill
stadium
would
be
prohibit
but
a
weather
contract
for
snowfall
total
in
the
zip
code
14127
be
allow
the
result
be
an
arbitrary
prohibition
of
an
otherwise
legitimate
contract
sport
be
a
multinational
multibillion
dollar
industry
affect
a
wide
range
of
business
and
individual
some
risk
for
participant
in
the
industry
may
relate
to
front
office
decision
such
as
whether
an
organization
will
move
a
team
to
another
city
hotel
restaurant
and
municipality
may
want
to
hedge
the
risk
of
a
team
either
leave
or
move
to
their
area
the
propose
rule
potentially
remove
the
opportunity
to
hedge
this
risk
for
individual
and
entity
such
as
those
describe
above
a
traditional
future
contract
base
on
a
reference
price
be
not
possible
while
certain
type
of
insurance
exist
to
hedge
the
risk
of
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
event
such
policy
be
either
expensive
bespoke
solution
or
as
with
the
case
of
business
interruption
insurance
have
so
many
exclusion
as
to
be
ineffective
the
commission
provide
no
factual
support
or
analysis
as
to
why
it
have
choose
to
define
the
term
game
in
this
manner
to
illustrate
the
commission
offer
the
follow
explanation
for
its
definition
of
game
the
commission
be
however
propose
to
define
gaming
to
include
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
event
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
which
the
commission
believe
would
be
as
much
of
a
wager
or
bet
on
the
game
or
contest
as
stake
or
risk
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
contest
would
be
conclusory
statement
such
as
this
can
not
support
a
rulemaking
they
need
to
be
inform
by
actual
analysis
3
the
commission
have
fail
to
provide
the
public
interest
factor
that
would
determine
whether
a
contract
would
be
consider
against
the
public
interest
the
commission
also
propose
to
offer
illustrative
example
of
its
public
interest
analysis
as
an
appendix
e
to
the
propose
rule
however
the
commission
have
fail
to
provide
the
content
of
this
appendix
and
have
no
plan
to
do
so
before
the
end
of
the
comment
period
as
a
result
railbird
can
not
provide
meaningful
comment
on
this
aspect
of
the
propose
rule
4
railbird
response
to
the
specific
question
contain
in
the
notice
of
propose
rulemake
on
the
follow
page
railbird
offer
its
comment
to
each
of
the
question
pose
by
the
commission
we
hope
the
commission
will
seriously
consider
the
impact
and
unintended
consequence
of
this
rule
as
propose
1
the
commission
request
comment
on
all
aspect
of
its
proposal
to
amend
to
remove
the
term
relate
to
and
reference
wherever
they
appear
and
to
refer
in
the
regulation
only
to
event
contract
that
involve
an
enumerate
activity
or
prescribe
similar
activity
involve
be
a
broad
and
vague
term
whereas
relate
to
and
reference
be
more
precise
the
term
reference
rate
and
underlying
reference
be
common
in
the
future
market
involve
be
not
use
a
much
broad
vague
term
like
involve
will
only
lead
to
more
confusion
for
dcms
as
they
try
to
offer
innovative
contract
that
their
participant
would
like
to
trade
2
be
there
example
of
activity
that
would
constitute
gaming
that
may
fall
outside
of
the
propose
definition
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
already
stretch
outside
of
its
logical
boundary
in
an
attempt
to
shoehorn
certain
activity
in
the
rule
the
commission
be
propose
a
definition
so
far
off
the
mark
as
to
be
illogical
3
be
there
other
type
of
vote
or
election
that
the
commission
should
specifically
identify
for
clarity
in
the
illustrative
example
in
propose
what
type
of
other
vote
or
election
should
be
identify
and
why
railbird
have
no
comment

should
the
availability
at
gaming
venue
of
bet
or
wager
on
a
particular
contingency
occurrence
or
event
be
a
relevant
factor
in
the
commission
consideration
of
whether
an
event
contract
involve
that
contingency
occurrence
or
event
involve
game
for
the
purpose
of
these
factor
can
be
a
consideration
but
not
the
only
one
5
if
on
judicial
review
it
be
determined
that
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
do
not
involve
game
the
commission
may
consider
whether
that
activity
be
similar
to
gaming
be
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
similar
to
gaming
railbird
have
no
comment
6
the
commission
may
also
consider
whether
it
should
enumerate
contract
involve
political
contest
or
some
subset
thereof
as
contract
involve
a
similar
activity
to
any
one
or
more
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
under
cea
section
and
determine
that
contract
involve
this
newly
enumerate
activity
of
political

contract
involve
a
similar
activity
to
any
one
or
more
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
if
so
should
the
commission
determine
such
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
railbird
have
no

7
the
commission
request
comment
as
to
whether
commenter
agree
with
the
commission
view
that
a
register
entity
be
unlikely
to
seek
to
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clear
a
contract
that
involve
a
state
law
prohibit
certain
activity
that
while
not
repeal
be
generally
consider
archaic
and
be
not
enforce

question
be
purely
hypothetical

can
not
speak
to
the
motivation
of
