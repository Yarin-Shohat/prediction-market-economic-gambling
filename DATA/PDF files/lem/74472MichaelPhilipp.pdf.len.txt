the
proposal
our
primary
interest
in
the
proposal
relate
to
the
commission
propose
new
definition
of
gaming
and
the
categorical
proclamation
that
every
contract
involve
athletic
game
would
automatically
be
deem
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibit
from
be
list
for
trading
or
clear
on
a
register
entity
eliminate
any
process
for
the
commission
to
review
or
analyze
the
potential
commercial
risk
management
utility
of
such
contract
the
proposal
include
an
unnecessarily
overbroad
definition
of
gaming
as
it
apply
to
athletic
game
that
be
I
inconsistent
with
the
commonly
understand
definition
of
event
contract
ii
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
and
iii
inconsistent
with
the
federal
and
state
regulation
of
sport
gambling
the
proposal
compound
the
problem
with
its
overbroad
definition
by
apply
that
definition
to
declare
in
advance
that
entire
category
of
event
contract
include
those
involve
sport
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
automatically
disqualify
from
be
list
thus
preclude
individual
consideration
of
the
specific
attribute
and
potential
commercial
utility
of
such
contract
we
believe
that
to
the
extent
the
commission
have
a
concern
with
athletic
event
contract
its
focus
and
rulemaking
should
properly
be
with
event
contract
that
serve
as
a
proxy
for
a
pure
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a

however
there

contract
that
be
base

provide
significant

and

management
benefit
to
numerous

from

these

that
reflect

performance
in

as
oppose
to
the
kind
of
binary

on
individual

that
characterize
sport
gaming
as
commonly
understand
and
which
the
commission
seem
most
concerned
with
non

could
create
a
market
for
hedge
trading

relate

these

could
allow

over

non

could
provide
price
discovery
and
an

to

against

economic

of

such

the

be

benefit
to

who
be
expose

from

but
this
can
happen
only
if
the

do
not
unnecessarily
include
such

within
an
overbroad

of

that
would
automatically
disqualify

by
dismiss
they
categorically
and
preclude
the
consideration
of
their

on
a

specific

the
commercial
rationale
for
non

be
fundamentally
different
from
an

use
binary

contract
to
place
a
wager
on
the
outcome
of
a

which
be
what
constitute

the

should
not
lump

the

definition

be

soon
after

the

adopt

provision
currently
there
be
no

the
cftc
propose
to
amend

to
define

thus
the
stake
of
get
the

right
be
very
high
because
an

will
result
in
the
disqualification
of

in
both
case
they
refer

the

contradict

unnecessary
to

the

because
they
exist

these

on

as

however
its

and
that

of

the

rather
if

the

it
be

bad
policy
for

to
make
pre
emptive
broad
categorical
determination
as
to

contract
as
illustrate
in
this
letter
there
can
be
various
type
of
athletic
event
contract
some
of
which
be
binary
event
contract
base
on
the
outcome
of
a

some
that
be
base
on
multiple

or

and
some
that
be
yet
to
be
develop
to
categorically
treat
all
athletic
event
contract
in
the
same
way
without
conduct
a
fact
specific
analysis
of
the
economic
utility
of
each
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
promote
responsible
financial
innovation
which
be
one
of
the
purpose
of
cftc
regulation
specify
under
the

of

occur
after
the
adoption
of

frank
and
the
adoption
of
section
of
the
cea
and
regulation
most
state
have
since
legalized
sport
bet
in
some
form
the
proposal
fail
to
take
these
recent
legal
and
societal
trend
and
development
into
its
consideration
of
its
legal
and
public
interest
analysis
and
instead
appear
to
want
to
find
that
gaming
as
very
broadly
define
in
the
proposal
be
per
se
against
the
public
interest
without
have
to
make
a
contract
specific
analysis
when
in
fact
the
develop
trend
be
to
permit
certain
type
of
sport
bet
to
be
clear
we
be
not
suggest
that
the
commission
should
permit
event
contract
that
can
operate
as
a
means
for
bet
on
the
outcome
of
an
athletic
game
but
in
seek
to
prohibit
such
contract
it
be
not
necessary
for
the
commission
to
also
disqualify
innovative
athletic
contract
that
can
serve
a
bona
fide
economic
risk
management
purpose
conclusion
we
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
provide
comment
on
the
proposal
we
be
concerned
that
the
proposal
overbroad
gaming
definition
and
the
predetermine
wholesale
categorical
declaration
of
ineligibility
as
to
gaming
contract
if
adopt
would
prevent
legitimate
commercial
sport
event
contract
from
be
available
to
register
entity
participant
with
economic
exposure
to
the
sport
industry
and
market
participant
stifle
the
promotion
of
responsible
innovation
which
would
be
contrary
to
one
of
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
commission
accordingly
the
commission
should
either
withdraw
the
proposal
or
recalibrate
its
approach
by
more
carefully
focus
on
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
event
contract
involve
gaming
and
be
especially
mindful
of
the
evolve
public
interest
reflect
in
the
strong
trend
of
state
liberalization
of
the
regulation
of
sport
bet
in
perform
its
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
should
continue
to
apply
its
historical
approach
of
conduct
individualized
analysis
of
contract
submit
by
register
entity
and
in
the
case
of
sport
event
contract
distinguish
between
event
contract
that
be
solely
a
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a
sport
game
or
contest
and
those
contract
that
be
structure
to
serve
a
real
economic
purpose
we
look
forward
to
further
engagement
with
the
commission
on
these
important
issue
