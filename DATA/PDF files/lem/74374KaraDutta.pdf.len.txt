the

view
the
propose
categorical
prohibition
of

be
inconsistent
with

instead
the
cftc
be
require
to

base
on
an
analysis
of
the

if
congress
have
seek
to
make
all

relate
to
the

in

section
categorically
unlawful
without

it
would
have
do
so
the
cea
instead
contemplate
a

determination
be
make
by
the
commission
base
on
relevant
evidence
and
analysis
which
the
proposal
do
not
do
accordingly
ice
do
not
support
the
cftc
propose
determination
and
amend
regulation
that
event
contract
involve
each
of
the
enumerate
activity
in
cea
section
game
war
terrorism
assassination
and
activity
that
be
unlawful
under

be
as
a

contrary
to

and
prohibit
from
be
list
for

or
accept
for
clear
on
a
register
entity
far
as
a
matter
of
policy
prohibit
entire
category
of
exchange
trade
contract
without
analysis
by
the
commission
be
unprecedented
and
conflict
with
the
cftc
mission
and
the
cea
directive
to
promote
product
innovation
the
proposal
approach
be
a
disservice
to
regulate
exchange
and
market
participant
as
it
preclude
innovation
in
entire
category
of
product
without
consideration
of
whether
the
contract
can
be
construct
in
a
manner
that
address
concern
about
the
underlie
activity
the
proposal
do
not
appropriately
implement
the
commission
authority
provide
by
congress
ice
also
disagree
with
the
commission
approach
to
define
gaming
for
purpose
of
the
cea
section
and
rule
ice
do
not
believe
the
propose
broad
definition
of
gaming
which
would
include
contract
relate
to
any
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
would
be
appropriate
if
the
commission
goal
be
to
define
gaming
to
include
bet
on
the
outcome
of
sporting
or
similar
event
it
should
draft
a
narrow
definition
ice
far
believe
that
the
cftc
proposal
to
extend
the
concept
of
gaming
to
include
any
contract
involve
staking
or
risk
something
of
value
base
on
a
political
contest
go
well
beyond
the
statutory
language
if
the
commission
believe
that
contract
base
on
a
political
contest
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
unlawful
it
should
make
that
determination
through
a
specific
order
or
rulemake
after
evaluate
evidence
and
undertake
analysis
of
that
contract
not
by
distort
the
term
game
beyond
it
generally
understand
mean
ultimately
congress
intend
that
the
commission
regulate
event
contract
within
the
framework
of
the
section
prohibition
however
instead
of
provide
clear
guidance
on
how
the
commission
will
regulate
exchange
and
the
listing
of
new
event
contract
the
commission
have
identify
broad
category
of
event
contract
that
simply
may
not
be
list
for
trade
if
the
commission
believe
that
certain
type
of
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
provide
specific
analysis
of
those
contract
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
consider
the
statutory
language
and
goal
of
the
cea
as
propose
the
amendment
would
interfere
with
the
development
of
new
type
of
contract
that
may
be
appropriate
for
exchange
trading
and
may
be
beneficial
to
market
participant
ice
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposal
ice
share
the
commission
goal
of
promote
transparency
accountability
and
predictability
and
facilitate
effective
oversight
ice
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
