my
name
be
robin
hanson
and
I
an
associate
professor
of
economic
at
george
mason
university
and
a
research
associate
at
the
future
of
humanity
institute
of
oxford
university
I
been
write
about
prediction
market
since
1988
and
be
the
first
to
write
on
their
potential
for
widespread
application
I
have
since
be
involve
in
many
relate
project
both
academic
and
practical
and
have
originate
key
technology
for
market
making
and
combinatorial
trading
and
have
study
many
kind
of
foul
play
include
price
manipulation
I
write
to
support
kalshi
proposal
to
list
contract
on
election
outcome
I
have
two
argument
regard
the
short
and
the
long
term
in
the
short
term
these
market
offer
concrete
social
benefit
plausibly
much
large
than
any
social
harm
on
the
benefit
side
prediction
market
allow
trader
to
hedge
their
portfolio
risk
and
offer
a
social
externality
benefit
to
the
world
via
the
information
in
their
price
these
benefit
be
well
know
in
the
relevant
academic
literature
and
not
seriously
in
any
doubt
neither
the
hedging
nor
the
info
be
perfect
but
clearly
improve
on
the
situation
where
such
market
be
absent
on
the
harm
side
there
might
in
theory
be
loss
from
people
who
might
make
more
risky
trade
than
be
good
for
they
or
who
might
sabotage
the
world
to
win
their
bet
price
manipulation
be
just
not
a
problem
in
such
market
but
there
be
already
plenty
of
way
to
make
risky
trade
so
it
be
hard
to
believe
add
these
few
way
make
much
difference
there
and
the
world
already
contain
many
party
with
strong
stake
in
election
make
it
hard
to
see
how
add
some
modest
bet
stake
would
make
much
difference
in
their
incentive
to
sabotage
however
I
actually
think
that
short
term
gain
here
be
small
compare
to
long
term
one
there
be
a
great
many
promising
big
way
in
which
prediction
market
might
support
need
reform
and
institutional
innovation
and
I
have
be
write
about
these
for
many
decade
but
legal
barrier
to
their
adoption
have
be
an
important
obstacle
to
pursue
these
change
so
I
see
big
gain
to
reduce
such
legal
barrier
as
we
be
unlikely
to
cut
such
barrier
all
at
once
we
should
instead
get
a
lot
more
practice
in
allow
more
market
watch
their
consequence
and
fine
tune
our
approach
and
regulation
to
adapt
to
any
perceive
problem
allow
more
election
market
seem
a
great
step
in
this
direction
