dear
chairman
and
commissioner
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
I
be
write
in
support
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
approve
kalshi
proposal
for
electoral
prediction
market
my
name
be
jason
furman
and
I
be
jointly
the
aetna
professor
of
the
practice
of
economic
policy
harvard
kennedy
school
and
a
professor
the
practice
of
economic
policy
in
the
economic
department
at
harvard
university
where
I
conduct
a
wide
range
of
research
on
policy
relate
issue
I
serve
as
chairman
of
the
council
of
economic
adviser
under
president
obama
from
2013
to
2017
serve
as
his
chief
economist
and
a
member
of
his
cabinet
prior
to
that
I
serve
as
deputy
director
of
the
national
economic
council
from
2009
to
2013
in
those
capacity
I
be
deeply
involve
in
the
administration
response
to
the
great
recession
and
at
the
forefront
of
some
of
the
large
economic
and
policy
debate
of
the
time
include
the
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
act
the
affordable
care
act
and
the
debate
over
the
debt
limit
and
fiscal
cliff
in
2011
and
2012
my
own
use
of
prediction
market
include
electoral
prediction
market
I
have
personally
encounter
and
extensively
use
prediction
market
include
electoral
prediction
market
extensively
in
three
different
setting
the
first
be
in
the
white
house
I
along
with
other
member
of
the
economic
team
would
regularly
refer
to
prediction
market
on
electoral
outcome
and
specific
event
to
help
inform
our
understanding
of
how
political
and
economic
development
would
affect
economic
policymaking
in
understand
the
risk
of
a
government
shutdown
or
debt
limit
showdown
for
example
it
would
be
helpful
to
understand
what
informed
trader
with
money
at
stake
would
expect
a
method
of
understand
probability
that
research
have
consistently
show
be
superior
to
other
way
of
summarize
and
update
base
on
information
the
second
be
in
economic
research
while
I
have
not
do
any
research
on
prediction
market
I
have
frequently
read
and
refer
to
this
research
to
understand
not
just
election
but
the
way
that
election
affect
financial
market
and
the
economy
more
broadly
in
fact
some
research
on
financial
market
and
the
economy
would
be
impossible
without
these
prediction
market
the
third
be
in
teach
I
co
teach
harvard
introductory
economics
class
call
ec10
and
we
introduce
our
student
to
prediction
market
show
that
on
average
they
have
historically
be
very
accurate
and
then
show
they
political
prediction
market
I
believe
that
understand
probability
the
difference
between
people
action
when
money
be
at
stake
and
when
it
just
cheap
talk
and
the
role
of
market
in
aggregate
information
be
helpful
to
student
generally
and
specifically
in
the
case
of
electoral
prediction
market
the
reason
why
political
prediction
market
be
superior
to
other
tool
for
all
of
the
above
purpose
be
that
they
incorporate
a
wide
range
of
information
quickly
and
efficiently
a
statistical
model
such
as
fivethirtyeight
can
only
reflect
the
impact
of
an
event
on
the
political
race
once
it
start
appear
in
poll
in
contrast
a
prediction
market
can
react
immediately
this
near
realtime
probability
calibration
can
be
highly
useful
for
researcher
whose
event
study
rely
on
a
quick
turnaround
between
the
event
occur
and
the
change
in
the
datum
in
order
to
isolate
the
effect
of
the
event
from
anything
else
occur
in
that
period
for
instance
a
researcher
try
to
learn
the
effect
of
a
supreme
court
decision
an
economic
datum
release
or
a
candidate
debate
on
electoral
outcome
can
not
wait
week
for
enough
poll
to
arrive
to
form
a
competent
polling
average
as
too
many
different
event
may
have
occur
in
the
interregnum
to
be
able
to
draw
conclusion
about
any
one
in
particular
prediction
market
as
a
price
discovery
tool
the
benefit
of
electoral
prediction
market
go
well
beyond
the
way
in
which
I
have
use
they
in
my
career
election
can
have
profound
affect
for
business
it
be
important
for
business
to
be
able
to
make
well
prediction
about
election
discuss
in
this
section
and
also
hedge
against
the
consequence
of
they
discuss
in
the
next
section
specifically
election
prediction
market
can
facilitate
more
accurate
price
discovery
in
other
market
even
those
who
be
not
actively
participate
in
the
market
for
election
contract
then
can
benefit
from
the
datum
that
it
provide
for
instance
suppose
an
energy
firm
be
attempt
to
assess
a
fair
market
value
for
fuel
to
be
deliver
two
year
hence
to
do
so
the
energy
firm
must
estimate
how
supply
and
demand
be
likely
to
evolve
over
that
period
perhaps
they
use
meteorological
datum
and
expect
the
winter
to
be
unusually
cold
and
thus
demand
might
rise
or
they
survey
earning
call
from
key
manufacturer
to
anticipate
that
supply
chain
bottleneck
from
overseas
natural
gas
producer
might
ease
up
lower
the
price
but
another
key
factor
they
will
consider
be
political
risk
legislative
change
in
environmental
policy
might
increase
or
decrease
the
cost
of
produce
natural
gas
while
there
be
plenty
of
satellite
datum
for
a
trader
to
use
to
estimate
the
weather
impact
on
demand
there
be
little
hard
datum
to
use
to
estimate
political
risk
which
be
a
large
part
of
the
pricing
puzzle
enter
election
prediction
market
trader
know
that
their
risk
of
beneficial
or
adverse
policy
change
depend
on
which
party
be
in
power
and
that
change
in
risk
be
exactly
what
be
necessary
to
price
those
commodity
future
more
accurately
a
liquid
well
regulate
prediction
market
offer
an
accurate
probability
estimate
of
who
be
likely
to
control
congress
would
thus
be
highly
valuable
to
price
discovery
there
be
ample
academic
evidence
to
suggest
that
prediction
market
be
highly
efficient
at
aggregate
information
to
produce
an
accurate
forecast
when
compare
to
alternative
especially
far
out
from
an
election
for
example
economist
erik
snowberg
justin
wolfers
and
eric
zitzewitz
use
datum
from
the
iowa
electronic
market
to
find
clear
linkage
between
prediction
market
price
and
equity
valuation

benefit
of
electoral
prediction
market
for
small
business
need
to
hedge
election
market
can
also
allow
business
and
other
to
participate
directly
and
hedge
against
the
consequence
of
election
absent
prediction
market
business
have
no
simple
and
transparent
way
to
hedge
against
these
risk
million
of
business
be
affect
by
change
in
congressional
control
face
both
positive
and
negative
risk
congressional
control
impact
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
way
that
have
direct
economic
consequence
to
business
and
worker
this
risk
be
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
similar
risk
that
can
and
should
be
manage
use
the
financial
market
many
business
have
a
regulated
component
to
they
either
directly
because
the
business
be
a
regulated
activity
or
as
an
integral
component
to
the
business
energy
healthcare
and
education
be
some
of
the
many
industry
that
be
directly
affect
by
the
federal
government
even
industry
that
be
not
directly
regulate
operate
in
an
environment
that
be
directly
impact
by
the
federal
government
whether
it
be
due
to
tax
policy
labor
regulation
financial
regulation
or
other
myriad
policy
the
government
set
political
control
can
also
impact
the
overall
business
environment
include
macroeconomic
development
like
the
likelihood
of
legislation
that
will
raise
or
low
overall
economic
activity
and
thus
business
sale
and
also
specific
change
that
could
affect
a
business
ability
to
raise
capital
hire
worker
and
expand
business
should
recalibrate
and
manage
risk
before
election
occur
business
be
forward
look
and
should
anticipate
change
in
policy
and
government
attitude
for
example
business
hire
contract
and
build
in
anticipation
of
future
demand
investment
decision
partnership
acquisition
and
more
be
make
in
anticipation
of
future
growth
and
performance
partnership
loan
and
equity
deal
be
similarly
forward
look
and
similarly
be
affect
by
political
control
accordingly
risk
management
must
begin
beforehand
as
well
equity
and
commodity
future
reprice
to
account
for
potential
change
in
political
control
election
market
also
provide
an
efficient
tool
for
manage
these
dynamic
and
interrelated
risk
a
person
that
face
risk
from
multiple
legislative
change
and
the
change
to
the
business
environment
that
come
with
political
control
can
effectively
manage
the
risk
through
this
contract
but
can
not
easily
do
so
use
contract
for
individual
policy
alone
it
be
this
hedge
utility
that
distinguish
the
market
from
the
gaming
contract
that
the
cftc
may
be
worried
about
whereas
gaming
contract
such
as
a
contract
on
the
number
of
touchdown
a
player
score
in
a
football
game
can
not
reasonably
be
use
for
risk
reduction
purpose
an
event
contract
on
congressional
control
clearly
relate
to
an
event
of
great
economic
importance
the
fact
that
many
participant
be
not
themselves
use
the
contract
for
hedging
do
not
refute
this
argument
if
anything
non
hedger
serve
a
valuable
purpose
by
provide
great
liquidity
and
superior
price
discovery
for
the
hedger
themselves
just
as
they
do
in
a
wide
range
of
financial
market
only
if
a
market
be
exclusively
use
by
speculator
because
the
underlying
event
do
not
create
sufficient
risk
that
can
be
hedge
would
a
contract
be
game
in
contrast
not
only
can
these
market
be
use
for
hedge
the
great
economic
importance
of
the
underlie
event
and
the
significance
of
the
risk
make
they
highly
likely
to
be
use
as
such
the
benefit
of
approve
electoral
prediction
market
overwhelmingly
outweigh
the
cost
election
be
not
game
and
the
outcome
of
political
control
of
congress
have
enormous
public
interest
ramification
election
focus
prediction
market
combine
the
economic
significance
of
a
powerful
risk
reduction
tool
for
small
business
with
the
social
significance
of
a
powerful
forecasting
tool
for
researcher
and
policy
maker
a
regulated
election
market
will
further
the
public
interest
by
provide
a
valuable
risk
management
tool
and
provide
datum
that
will
be
valuable
to
business
economic
researcher
and
policymaker
alike
this
be
the
exact
kind
of
innovation
that
the
cftc
should
be
embrace
I
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
