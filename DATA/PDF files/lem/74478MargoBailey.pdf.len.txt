several
of

be
impact
by
the

the
commission
explain
that
the
proposal
aim
to
provide
register

with
additional
clarity
regard
the
type
of

that

thereby

proposal
89
fed

at

although
the
proposal
discuss
the
effect
of
the
propose
amendment
on
register
entity
generally
it
do
not
consider
that
a
final
rule
will
necessarily
impact
exchange
and
clearinghouse
differently
for
example
exchange
will
naturally
focus
on
initial
contract
design
and
list
decision
whereas
clearinghouse
will
focus
on
identify
all
open
position
cover
by
the
final
rule
that
must
be
wind
down
accordingly
miaxdx
have
concentrate
its
comment
below
on
the
unique
impact
a
final

would
have
on
clearinghouse
in
particular
miaxdx
comment
address
challenge
clearinghouse
will
face
with
respect
to
the
identification
and
orderly
wind
down
of

contract
and
recommend
several
change
to
the
proposal
that
would
facilitate
that
process
ii
proposal
register

make
good

effort
to
wind

inscope
contract
should
not
be
subject
to
a
60
day
implementation
period
for
the
reason
outline
below
miaxdx
respectfully
submit
that
60
day
be
not
sufficient
time
for
register
entity
to
I
identify
all
contract
impact
by
any
final
rule
and
ii
arrange
for
an
orderly
cessation
of
their
trading
instead
register
entity
work
in
good
faith
to
comply
expeditiously
with
any
final
rule
should
not
be
subject
to
an
arbitrary
final
date
by
which
all
contract
must
be
de
list
and
settle
rather
any
deadline
should
be
tailor
to
the
settlement
date
of
contract
already
trade
or
be
clear
through
a
particular
exchange
or
clearinghouse
at
the
time
a
final
rule
be
adopt
the
proposal
provide
a
60
day
implementation
period
after
the
final
rule
be
publish
in
the
federal
register
proposal
89
fed
reg
at
48995
during
this
implementation
period
register
entity
must
oversee
the
expiration
of
or
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
all
list
event
contract
that
be
impact
by
the
final
rule
I
d
in
explain
why
this
60
day
implementation
period
be
appropriate
the
commission
assert
that
I
many
event
contract
settle
within
relatively
short
time
horizon
and
ii
event
contract
that
involve
game
currently
comprise
a
small
portion
of
the
overall
event
contract
market
that
few
event
contract
impact
by
the
propose
rule
amendment
if
finalize
would
need
to
be
wind
down
before
their
exist
settlement
date
I
d
additionally
the
commission
note
that
it
believe
the
60
day
implementation
period
would
provide
sufficient
time
for
the
register
entity
to
ensure
the
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
any
long
date
contract
I
d
base
upon
our
preliminary
analysis
of
contract
currently
list
for
trading
and
clear
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
commission
assessment
that
few
contract
be
implicate
by
the
proposal
miaxdx
believe
there
be
potentially
hundred
of
contract
currently
list
for
trading
on
dcms
or
sef
that
could
be
implicate
by
the
final
definition
of
gaming
for
example
there

or
non

in
connection
with

for

there

this

in
addition
although
the
commission
be
correct
that
many
event
contract
have
short
time
horizon
that
be
not
universally
the
case
various
event
contract
be
either
long

or
have
an
indeterminate

base
on
the

example
a

the
settlement
of
an

necessarily

to
the

of
the
show
with
the
grammys
currently
schedule
for
february
2025
and
the
oscar
currently
schedule
for
march
2025
and
litigation
contract
often
settle
upon
the
date
of
any
settlement
or
final
decision
by
a
court
far
as
detail
below
it
be
impossible
for
a
register
entity
to
know
with
certainty
which
event
contract
fall
within
the
scope
of
any
final
rule
depend
upon
the
final
definition
adopt
as
well
as
any
guidance
in
the
preamble
it
be
possible
that
additional
contract
may
come
into
scope
while
other
contract
may
be
exclude
in
the
proposal
the
commission
note
that
it
expect
registered
entity
to
make
good
faith
effort
that
will
result
in
conformance
with
the
final
rule
amendment
by
no
later
than
the
effective
date
of
the
final
amendment
or
the
60
day
implementation
period
as
applicable
these
good
faith
effort
should
take
the
final
rule
amendment
into
account
in
all
compliance
contract
design
and
list
trading
or
clearing
decision
as
well
as
in
decision
lead
to
the
orderly
and
timely
winddown
of
any
contract
with
settlement
date
beyond
the
60
day
implementation
period
89
fed
reg
at
48985
in
order
to
begin
wind
down
cover
contract
miaxdx
must
first
comprehensively
analyze
each
contract
to
determine
which
be
in
scope
moreover
because
the
boundary
of
what
constitute
a
game
or
contest
be
not
clear
under
the
propose
gaming
definition
and
may
not
be
sufficiently
clarify
in
any
final
definition
in
many
case
miaxdx
may
need
to
consult
the
commission
to
confirm
it
agree
with
miaxdx
determination
in
addition
because
miaxdx
clear
event
contract
for
an
unaffiliated
third
party
exchange
miaxdx
will
also
need
to
coordinate
with
this
dcm
regard
contract
determination
and
the
cessation
of
trading
in
scope
contract
lastly
as
we
explain
far
below
there
be
significant
legal
operational
and
reputational
risk
to
miaxdx
and
other
register
entity
if
they
incorrectly
conclude
that
a
particular
contract
be
either
in
scope
or
out
of
scope
from
the
rulemaking
for
all
of
these
reason
miaxdx
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
eliminate
a
final
60
day
deadline
by
which
all
in
scope
contract
must
be
de
list
instead
we
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
provide
exchange
and
clearinghouse
the
flexibility
and
time
they
need
to
analyze
each
contract
confer
with
the
commission
about
their
determination
and
responsibly
wind
down
trading
and
clearing
of
in
scope
contract
in
an
orderly
manner
the
commission
should
establish
a
process
by
which
register
entity
can
receive
clarity
quickly
about
whether
a
contract
be
cover
by
the
final
rule
in
order
to
facilitate
implementation
of
any
final
rule
miaxdx
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
establish
a
process
by
which
exchange
and
clearinghouse
can
engage
the
commission
to
resolve
open
implementation
question
as
discuss
in
great
detail
below
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
make
it
impossible
for
register
entity
to
determine
with
certainty
whether
many
event
contract
be
either
in
scope
or
out
ofscope
give
the
significant
consequence
of
that
determination
to
both
register
entity
and
market
participant
it
be
critical
that
there
be
a
process
for
register
entity
include
clearinghouse
to
engage
with
the
commission
to
confirm
whether
particular
contract
be
encompass
by
the
proposal
miaxdx
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
establish
a
process
by
which
register
entity
can
submit
a
list
of
contract
along
with
their
preliminary
determination
regard
whether
they
be
or
out
of
scope
for
confirmation
by
the
division
of
market
oversight
and
the
division
of
clearing
and
risk
upon
confirmation
the
register
entity
would
begin
the
process
of
wind
down
the
contract
in
an
orderly
manner
the
absence
of
a
process
by
which
register
entity
can
receive
clarity
from
the
commission
expose
they
to
unnecessary
legal
reputational
operational
risk
because
of
the
significant
consequence
of
an
incorrect
determination
for
example
if
a
register
entity
decide
in
good
faith
that
a
contract
be
not
cover
by
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
but
the
commission
subsequently
disagree
the
register
entity
may
not
only
be
subject
to
penalty
from
the
commission
but
it
be
also
unclear
whether
such
contract
would
continue
to
enjoy
federal
preemption
from
applicable
state
gaming
law
depend
upon
the
fact
and
circumstance
a
clearinghouse
or
exchange
may
be
at
risk
of
be
the
subject
of
claim
or
investigation
arise
from
state
gaming
or
gambling
law
whether
from
private
cause
of
action
or
state
or
local
authority
while
we
would
expect
that
any
federally
regulate
exchange
or
clearinghouse
would
vigorously
defend
itself
against
any
such
allegation
this
potential
outcome
can
be
avoid
by
narrow
the
definition
of
gaming
as
describe
under
section
and
below
on
the
other
hand
if
a
register
entity
be
over
inclusive
and
determine
that
an
event
contract
be
encompass
within
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
market
participant
may
be
unnecessarily
force
to
close
out
their
lawful
position
in
fact
the
same
register
entity
may
simultaneously
be
both
and
under
inclusive
in
its
determination
of
what
be
cover
by
the
commission
propose
vague
definition
of
gaming
thereby
expose
it
to
both
such
risk
give
the
significant
consequence
of
make
an
incorrect
determination
miaxdx
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
establish
a
process
by
which
register
entity
may
obtain
legal
certainty
about
whether
a
contract
be
in
scope
before
they
be
require
to
take
action
on
contract
they
currently
clear
or
offer
for
trade
the
commission
should
limit
the
definition
of
gaming
to
those
activity
commonly
understand
to
be
game
the
potential
negative
consequence
of
an
incorrect
scope
determination
could
be
mitigate
by
narrow
the
definition
of
gaming
so
that
the
final
rule
text
itself
provide
a
clear
unequivocal
standard
miaxdx
believe
that
the
definition
of
gaming
should
be
limit
to
those
activity
that
be
commonly
understand
to
be
game
contract
involve
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
game
point
spread
or
the
performance
of

in
a

as
miaxdx
note
below
the
commission
may
prohibit
event
contract
involve
election

show
by
promulgate
a

find
that
such
activity
be
I
similar
to
one
of
the
prohibit
enumerate
activity
under

and
ii
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
more
restrictive
definition
of
gaming
that
align
with
the
historical
understanding
of
the
word
would
facilitate
register
entity
identification
of
in
scope
contract
as
discuss
below
the
propose
definition
of

include
many
activity
that
be
not

such
as
election

show
however
the
senate
colloquy
regard
cea
section
do
not
reference
award
show

and
instead
focus
on
game
and

miaxdx
respectfully
submit
that
the
definition
of
gaming
should
be
limit
to
sporting
event
and
game
as
the
colloquy
suggest
the
cea
provide
the
commission
with
authority
to
prohibit
additional
type
of
contract
via
the
rulemaking
process
the
commission
do
not
have
to
find
that
all
the
event
contract
it
seek
to
prohibit
be
game
contract
because
the
cea
establish
an
alternate
path
for
such
prohibition
specifically
cea
section
authorize
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contract
on
other
type
of
activity
if
it
promulgate
a
rule
find
that
such
activity
be
I
similar
to
one
of
the
prohibit
enumerate
activity
under
the
cea
and
ii
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
commission
seek
to
prohibit
contract
involve
a
broad
universe
of
activity
beyond
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
term
game
include
activity
like
award
show
and
election
then
miaxdx
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
do
so
via
rulemake
as
contemplate
by
statute
if
the
commission
adopt
this
approach
then
contract
involve
these
broad
topic
would
be
prohibit
but
not
as
gaming
and
therefore
an
incorrect
determination
by
a
register
entity
under
regulation
likely
would
not
cause
the
entity
to
potentially
violate
state
gaming
or
gambling
regime
thereby
limit
the
legal
and
reputational
risk
to
the
exchange
or
clearinghouse
alternatively
the
commission
should
clarify
the
meaning
of
certain
prong
of
the
propose
gaming
definition
the
proposal
broad
definition
of
gaming
present
significant
implementation
challenge
because
it
be
difficult

not
impossible
to
discern
the

of

the

under

if

we

limit
the

movie
score
report
on
rotten
tomato
would
not
be
consider
a
contest
because
the
ranking
be
not
part
of
a
formal
contest
but
rather
be
critic
and
individual
real
world
ranking
similarly
a
contract
base
upon
who
be
choose
to
be
ceo
of
a
company
would
also
not
be
a
contest
limit
the
definition
to
formalize
competition
ensure
that
the
prohibition
do
not
extend
to
all
circumstance
where
a
contract
be
settle
base
upon
the
competitive
performance
of
the
underlie
subject
matter
ii
the
commission
should
narrow
the
scope
of
its
propose
category
of
prohibit
event
contract
that
reference
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
propose
rule
would
establish
a
catch
all
category
of
prohibit
gaming
contract
for
contract
base
on
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
miaxdx
respectfully
submit
that
this
clause
should
be
narrow
to
an
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
that
affect
the
outcome
miaxdx
believe
that
prohibit
a
contract
base
upon
any
event
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
be
too
broad
because
it
encompass
event
that
be
not
commonly
understand
to
be
game
for
example
as
commissioner
mersinger
note
in
her
statement
accompany
the
proposal
the
propose
definition
would
include
a
contract
on
whether
taylor
swift
attend
a
football
game
however
it
be
not
obvious
why
swift
attendance
at
the
game
constitute
game
give
that
her
attendance
be
not
directly
relate
to
the
outcome
of
the
game
and
indeed
may
be
determine
base
upon
factor
completely
unrelated
to
the
game
such
as
her
touring
schedule
additionally
some
contract
that
would
be
sweep
up
by
such
a
broad
definition
of
gaming
have
actual
economic
significance
independent
from
the
outcome
of
the
game
miaxdx
respectfully
submit
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
classify
these
contract
which
be
not
relate
to
the
outcome
of
the
game
be
not
traditionally
understand
as
gaming
and
have
their
own
economic
significance
in
the
real
world
as
gaming
for
example
contract
base
upon
event
attendance
number
of
hot
dog
sell
or
television
rating
all
have
economic
consequence
independent
from
the
outcome
of
the
game
itself
under
the
propose
revise
definition
of
game
none
of
these
contract
would
be
prohibit
as
gaming
because
they
do
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
game
in
contrast
miaxdx
believe
it
be
appropriate
to
include
within
the
definition
of
game
any
contract
base
upon
point
spread
or
the
individual
performance
of
competitor
contract
base
upon
such
activity
directly
impact
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
contest
moreover
they
be
commonly
understand
to
constitute
gaming
and
therefore
would
be
easy
for
register
entity
to
identify
as
in
scope
in
contrast
include
any
event
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
could
conceivably
include
many
event
that
be
merely
tangential
and
potentially
totally
unrelated
to
the
underlying
contest
or
game
for
these
reason
miaxdx
respectfully
request
that
this
prong
of
the
gaming
definition
be
limit
to
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
that
affect
the
outcome
miaxdx
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposal
and
look
forward
to
continue
engagement
with
the
cftc

the
