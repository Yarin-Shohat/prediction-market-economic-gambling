I
live
in
the
baltimore
washington
area
my
wife
and
I
be
bless
with
young
child
my
wife
be
a
who
be
active
at
a
prominent
hospital
I
be
an
attorney
whose
practice
involve
civil
right
litigation
there
be
of
course
many
event
that
would
impact
my
family
economically
here
be
some
of
they
climate
change
relate
event
such
as
extreme
weather
impact
our
daily
life
would
increase
our
cost
and
impact
we
significantly
change
in
healthcare
funding
will
impact
my
wife
remuneration
and
importantly
her
work
environment
change
to
medicare
funding
for
example
will
have
a
big
impact
change
to
the
way
that
new
treatment
and
medication
be
approve
will
also
impact
her
work
she
have
develop
expertise
and
will
continue
to
stay
at
the
cutting
edge
of
patient
care
general
policy
change
that
impact
healthcare
and
medical
ethic
such
as
many
of
the
ongoing
discussion
regard
abortion
access
and
gender
reassignment
have
significant
ramification
for
my
wife
work
change
to
the
tax
code
such
as
child
tax
credit
child
care
deduction
and
fsa
will
affect
we
economically
criminal
justice
reform
will
impact
my
practice
this
include
a
plethora
of
potential
change
many
of
these
change
have
impact
that
be
measurable
in
dollar
and
cent
such
as
change
to
fund
tax
policy
and
certain
criminal
justice
reform
many
other
be
intangible
such
as
many
of
the
climate
change
impact
however
it
be
patently
obvious
that
these
impact
have
economic
impact
from
the
violence
against
woman
act
all
the
way
though
the
current
understanding
of
the
importance
of
esg
and
diversity
and
inclusion
something
do
not
require
a
dollar
sign
in
front
of
it
to
have
a
substantial
and
significant
economic
impact
we
assign
a
value
to
these
impact
base
on
our
own
research
and
determination
we
also
determine
that
the
likelihood
of
these
event
occur
be
different
depend
on
whether
there
be
democratic
republican
or
split
control
of
congress
my
family
risk
exposure
to
negative
economic
event
change
depend
on
which
party
control
congress
we
could
use
kalshi
contract
to
manage
these
risk
while
it
be
unlikely
that
we
would
hedge
to
the
point
that
we
risk
neutral
we
could
hedge
the
outcome
of
the
election
to
lower
our
risk
profile
in
line
with
our
risk
tolerance
this
directly
and
generally
address
your
question
6
9
on
that
I
have
two
additional
point
the
first
be
regard
question
9
be
very
small
dollar
value
contract
target
at
individual
retail
customer
likely
to
have
hedge
utility
for
such
customer
when
the
contract
offer
position
on
macro
level
national
political
event
the
answer
be
a
resounding
yes
it
be
difficult
to
understand
how
one
could
consider
the
possibility
that
election
in
general
let
alone
control
over
congress
do
not
affect
individual
do
the
cftc
consider
it
remotely
possible
that
election
only
impact
big
business
I
be
concerned
that
this
question
may
reflect
an
unconscious
bias
against
retail
customer
from
the
nation
most
important
financial
regulator
my
second
point
be
relate
to
the
first
it
be
clear
that
the
correct
standard
should
be
whether
a
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
not
will
be
use
for
hedge
here
be
why
if
the
cftc
insist
on
a
will
be
use
standard
the
cftc
will
perforce
be
make
a
judgment
on
how
I
as
a
market
participant
will
be
use
the
contract
that
be
not
the
cftc
job
I
be
competent
at
assess
my
own
risk
my
assessment
will
likely
be
different
than
the
cftc
I
sincerely
hope
that
the
cftc
do
not
think
that
its
assessment
be
well
or
more
valid
than
mine
I
be
confident
the
cftc
would
agree
that
I
should
have
a
voice
in
determine
how
I
assess
and
manage
my
risk
as
such
question
6
10
should
not
be
the
cftc
concern
in
close
it
surprise
I
than
an
historically
diverse
commission
with
an
emphasized
commitment
to
esg
diversity
and
increase
minority
access
to
market
would
suggest
a
we
know
your
risk
well
than
you
do
approach
as
a
minority
I
respectfully
request
that
you
let
my
family
access
the
market
too
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
my
public
comment
