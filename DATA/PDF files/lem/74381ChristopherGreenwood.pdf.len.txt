sequoia
have
be
an
investor
in
kalshi
since
2020
we
invest
in
company
that
have
the
potential
to
become
endure
institution
and
a
powerful
force
for
good
we
invest
in
kalshi
because
we
believe
that
an
event
marketplace
can
become
a
very
valuable
business
in
the
long
run
as
the
cftc
consider
kalshi
proposal
we
want
to
highlight
two
specific
area
value
in
political
prediction
market
first
we
believe
that
political
prediction
market
provide
valuable
data
point
to
the
public
by
unlock
the
wisdom
of
the
crowd
thousand
of
participant
trading
create
information
about
the
state
of
an
electoral
race
which
be
far
more
likely
to
be
accurate
than
the
prediction
of
political
analyst
many
of
whom
be
incentivize
to
facilitate
a
particular
outcome
we
believe
this
information
could
cut
through
the
noise
from
polling
news
and
other
source
of
information
that
may
have
negative
impact
on
election
and
the
public
confidence
in
election
and
the
electoral
process
in
fact
allow
these
market
could
bolster
civic
literacy
and
honesty
and
be
in
the
public
interest
in
a
political
prediction
market
hedger
and
trader
would
be
able
to
provide
fast
move
accurate
information
about
an
electoral
race
that
incorporate
poll
fundamental
platform
and
any
other
salient
change
because
hedger
and
trader
have
a
profit
incentive
to
get
this
right
any
inaccuracy
be
quickly
trade
away
and
the
crowd
wisdom
would
prevail
though
these
type
of
market
have
exist
previously
the
lack
of
a
legal
well
regulate
market
have
limit
the
ability
for
they
to
break
into
the
mainstream
moreover
an
educate
electorate
be
an
engaged
electorate
the
reasonable
assumption
be
that
market
participant
would
learn
about
what
they
trade
trader
would
accordingly
spend
hour
learn
about
the
in
and
out
of
a
race
become
more
informed
citizen
in
the
process
the
public
interest
in
these
market
be
vast
impact
on
electoral
process
second
in
question
13
the
cftc
have
ask
about
the
potential
impact
on
electoral
integrity
we
believe
that
kalshi
proposal
do
not
pose
a
risk
to
the
integrity
of
the
election
system
nor
impact
the
popular
perception
of
the
integrity
of
the
election
concern
about
the
potential
impact
on
election
integrity
be
not
support
by
datum
we
have
year
of
datum
from
organization
like
predictit
and
similar
entity
in
other
country
like
the
united
kingdom
where
they
have
host
so
call
majority
contract
for
decade
the
market
have
not
identify
datum
that
show
that
this
market
activity
have
cause
any
election
manipulation
and
we
believe
what
kalshi
be
propose
be
safe
and
would
not
lead
to
election
manipulation
many
hypothetical
concern
regard
the
small
margin
in
minor
election
for
example
local
or
state
election
however
kalshi
be
not
propose
to
offer
contract
on
small
election
but
be
rather
propose
a
contract
on
which
party
control
the
house
and
senate
which
involve
many
election
with
ten
of
million
of
voter
it
be
worth
note
that
kalshi
propose
position
limit
be
not
high
the
incentive
to
manipulate
the
market
at
this
low
level
be
nearly
non
existent
in
fact
we
believe
that
the
market
could
absorb
much
high
position
limit
without
any
risk
of
manipulation
perhaps
a
low
limit
might
be
require
for
an
election
with
a
small
voting
base
such
as
a
mayoral
race
in
a
mid
sized
city
or
a
governorship
of
a
small
state
but
that
be
not
the
case
before
we
consider
that
control
of
congress
consist
of
hundred
of
election
involve
ten
of
million
of
voter
there
be
no
incentive
for
any
individual
to
change
their
vote
nor
attempt
to
change
the
vote
of
other
the
upside
be
far
too
low
and
uncertain
consider
the
risk
and
expense
involve
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
a
comment
relate
to
kalshi
proposal
we
be
excited
about
the
promise
that
prediction
market
can
bring
in
enhance
forecasting
and
expand
access
to
valuable
information
about
election
and
we
encourage
the
cftc
to
approve
kalshi
proposal
