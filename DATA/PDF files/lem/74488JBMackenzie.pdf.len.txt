section
the

we
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
provide
comment
on
the
proposal
robinhood
derivative
believe
the
proposal
be
far
too
broad
as
it
would
prohibit
certain
product
and
limit
product
innovation
for
which
the
cftc
should
not
have
concern
as
such
we
believe
that
any
categorical
prohibition
that
prevent
the
listing
and
the
trading
of

should
be
narrowly
tailor
to
achieve
a

goal
for
the
purpose
of
this

we
will
focus
on
the
proposal
potential
impact
on
the
broad

specifically
we
believe
that

the

the

lack
sufficient
economic

give
the
breadth
of
the

and
3
the
proposal
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
the
cftc
have
not
properly
assess
the

in

this

have
be

in

they
have
work
with
dcms

to
develop

distribute
future

that
meet
the
need
of

likewise

which
if

would

allow
retail

innovative

ii
the
proposal
definition
of

be
overly
broad
and
ambiguous
the
cftc
propose
an

oppose
the

in
that
it
broadly
and
unnecessarily
eliminate
the
possibility
of

for

the

support
this
broad

base
on
the
follow
colloquy
between
two
senator
feinstein
I
hope
it
be
the
senator
intent
as
the
author
of
this
provision
to
define
public

broadly
so
that
the
cftc
may
consider
the
extent
to
which
a
propose
derivative
contract
would
be
use
predominantly
by
speculator
or
participant
not
have
a
commercial
or
hedge
interest
will
cftc
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a

be
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
be
speculative
as
oppose
to
a
hedging
or
economic
use
lincoln
that
be
our
intent
the
commission
need
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivative
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
suppose
event
contract
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
event
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
master
golf
tournament
these
type
of
contract
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
use
solely
for

give

to
prohibit

have

can
not

by

there

an

offer

for

for

a

even
an
individual

ticket
holder
who
sell
their
seat
to
other
during
the
season
have
a
commercial
reason
to
hedge
as
the
value
of
their
ticket
will
rise
and
fall
with
the
laker
win
loss
record
just
as
a
farmer
can
hedge
his

bad
crop
yield
these
entity
and
person
which
all
have
valuable
economic
interest
in
the
performance
of

should

also
do

note

believe
that
the

must
perform
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
whether
the
breadth
of
its
prohibition
on
certain
event
contract
could
qualify
as
be
in

as
commissioner
mersinger
note
commission
can
short
circuit
the
process
that

establish

determine
that
an

be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
advance
and
without
know
the
contract
term
and
condition
simply
because
that
make
thing
easy
for
the

89

the
correct
approach
here
would
be
to
narrow
the
definition
so
it
only
capture
single
event
directly
associate
with
sport
gambling
robinhood
derivative
recommend
that
the
commission
revisit
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
so
it
do
not
capture
product
that
can
involve
legitimate
risk
management
and
speculative
activity
which
have
otherwise
be
permit
by
the
cftc
for
decade
one
way
to
achieve
this
be
to
remove
the
last
clause
of
the
propose
definition
which
would
capture
contract
with
the
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
contest
or
game
by
remove
this
specific
section
we
believe
that
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
would
well
align
with
congressional
intent
to
prohibit

tie
to
a
single
specific
sporting

the

to

should
be
base

own
expect

as
well
as
the
cost
of

potential

contract
that
may
be
consider

nowhere
in
the
proposal
however
do
the
cftc
discuss
what
the
cost

analysis
would
be
for
market
participant
the
cftc
focus
on
the
few
propose

contract
that
have
come
under
the
cftc
review
and
provide
an
inadequate

specifically
the

estimate
that

less

indeed
the
cftc
admit
that
these
potentially
problematic
contract
account
for
less
than
1
of
the
total

volume
in

thereby
acknowledge
that
the
proposal
be
base
on
a
de

amount
of
participation
in

the
true
cost
of
the

would
fall
on
the
would
be

and
new
entrant
to

that
would
be
preclude
from

indeed
the
proposal
do
not
raise
any
concern
with
the
self
certification
process
and
we
believe
that
the
cftc
should
continue
to
permit
dcms
to
evaluate
potential
new
contract
without
categorically
prohibit
such
contract
conclusion
although
we
recognize
the
cftc
intention
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
derivative
market
we
believe
that
the
proposal
be
overly
broad
and
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
the
proposal
and
engage
in
further
dialogue
with
future
market
participant
and
retail
trader
to
develop
a
more
balanced
and
effective
regulatory
approach
specifically
consistent
with
congressional
intent
