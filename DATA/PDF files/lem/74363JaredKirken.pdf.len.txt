I
be
write
as
a
small
business
owner
to
express
my
opposition
to
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
election
market
and
to
urge
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
stance
these
market
offer
significant
benefit
particularly
in
term
of
hedge
against
political
uncertainty
that
can
impact
small
business
like
mine
as
a
small
business
owner
I
be
acutely
aware
of
how
political
outcome
can
directly
affect
my
operation
change
in
policy
relate
to
taxation
healthcare
and
regulation
can
have
substantial
implication
for
my
business
financial
health
election
market
provide
a
valuable
tool
for
manage
these
risk
by
allow
I
to
hedge
against
potential
adverse
outcome
for
example
if
there
be
concern
that
a
particular
election
result
might
lead
to
increase
regulatory
burden
or
change
in
tax
policy
I
can
use
election
market
to
offset
potential
financial
impact
by
participate
in
these
market
I
can
create
a
financial
buffer
that
help
stabilize
my
business
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
much
like
how
large
corporation
use
future
market
to
hedge
against
commodity
price
fluctuation
furthermore
operate
within
a
regulated
environment
on
platform
like
kalshi
and
predictit
ensure
that
these
hedging
activity
be
secure
and
transparent
this
regulatory
oversight
protect
small
business
owner
from
the
risk
associate
with
unregulated
and
illegal
market
such
as
fraud
and
market
manipulation
ban
election
market
would
push
these
valuable
risk
management
tool
to
offshore
or
illegal
platform
deprive
small
business
owner
of
the
protection
and
benefit
that
come
with
regulation
therefore
I
urge
the
cftc
to
recognize
the
importance
of
election
market
for
small
business
and
to
support
their
operation
within
a
legal
and
regulated
framework
this
approach
will
not
only
enhance
market
efficiency
but
also
provide
small
business
owner
with
essential
tool
to
navigate
political
uncertainty
