the
cftc
to
prohibit

event

stifle

and
encourage
industry
participant
to
move
their
trading
overseas
to
work
under
the
watch
of
foreign
regulator
who
would
not
provide
the
level
of
safety
standard
customer
protection
and
market
oversight
as
the
cftc
instead
the
cftc
should
embrace
the
authority
congress
have
already
give
it
to
encourage
regulate
and
safe
market
activity
on
event
contract
so
the
united

a
leader
in

during
a
house
agriculture
committee
hearing
on

your

commodity
exchange
act
to
ensure
no
new
participant
or
company
list
political
event
contract
while
you
have
make
your
position
clear
we
want
to
ensure
that
any
rulemaking
undertake
by
the
commission
properly
examine
all
fact
and
detail
and
thoroughly
consider
the
potential
benefit
this
economic
activity
might
have
on
nontraditional
market
participant
rather
than
arrive
at
a
presuppose
position
you
far
state
that
political
event
contract
be
prohibit
due
to
they
be
classify
as
gaming
as
well
as
unlawful
under
state
law
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
the
commission
consider
future
action
we
would
encourage
the
commission
to
consider
if
its
reasoning
here
would
also
mean
that
other
contract
currently
be
offer
such
as
contract
on
market
volatility
digital
asset
oil
and
even
the
weather
be
equally
game
and
not
legitimate
economic
activity
in
previous
action
take
by
the
cftc
the
commission
state
it
find
political
event
contract
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
a
form
of
the
economic
purpose
test
that
be
remove
through
congressional
action
in
the
commodity
future
modernization
act
of
2000
give
congress
have
determine
this
test
no
long
serve
as
a
viable
evaluation
we
urge
the
commission
to
clarify
how
it
well
determine
these
contract
run
contrary
to
the
public
interest
lastly
we
recognize
the
commission
be
involve
in
ongoing
litigation
relate
to
event
contract
we
urge
caution
that
this
rulemaking
or
any
future
rulemaking
do
not
influence
ongoing
legal
proceeding
give
that
this
action
have
the
potential
to
affect
a
large
set
of
product
we
believe
it
be
in
the
good
interest
of
the
public
for
the
commission
to
engage
in
a
hearing
or
public
roundtable
before
make
a
final
determination
we
appreciate
the
commission

rule
base
process

thoughtful
and
deliberate
approach
when
consider
event

it
be
vital
that
