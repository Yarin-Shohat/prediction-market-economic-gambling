this

unsupported

the

find
that
the
propose

constitute
gaming
which
the
cftc
define
as
be
synonymous
with

bet
or
wager
the
cftc
broadly
define
these
term
to
mean
that
the
relevant
statute
prohibit

something
of

base
upon
the
occurrence

at

the

fail
to
acknowledge
or
grapple
with
the
fact
that
its
disapproval
of
the
propose

differ
from
its
longstanding
practice
the
future
sale
price
of
a
traditional

be
clearly
a
contingent
event
not
in
the
control
of
the
party
to
a
future
contract
under
the
reasoning
the
cftc
advance
in
the
order
nearly
every
transaction
regulate
by
the
commodity
exchange
act
would
be
in

of
some
state

the

arbitrary
interpretation

if
the
cftc
be
serious
about
its
interpretation

standard
articulate

and
apply

elsewhere
it
would
undermine
the
rationale
for

as
nearly
all

may
in

way

risk
overlap
with

nowhere
in
the
order
do
the
cftc
address
the
sweeping
consequence
of
the
order
interpretation
of
the
act
nor
do
the
cftc
attempt
to
reconcile
this
interpretation
with
decision
it
have
make
and
contract
it
have
allow
in
the
past
the
cftc
order
fail
to
adequately
explain
how
it
be
that
kalshi
propose
contract
constitute
gaming
but
other
contract
offer
on
dcms
do
not
both
of
these
shortcoming
define
the

prohibit

the
cftc
must
provide
the
public
with
a
definition
of
gaming
that
it
can
consistently
and
non
arbitrarily
apply
to
propose
contract
it
have
not
do
so
the
commission
misunderstand
the
nature
of
the
propose
contract
nor
do
the
commission
state
concern
that
approval
of
the

could
require
the

to
election

the
concern
fundamentally
misunderstand
the

that
the

be
at
odd
with
the

and
be
contrary
to
evidence

the
commission
reliance
on
this
reason
for
rejection
of

the
