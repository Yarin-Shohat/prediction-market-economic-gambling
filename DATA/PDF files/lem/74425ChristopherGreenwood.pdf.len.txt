I
write
in
support
of
kalshi
propose
congressional
control
contract
these
contract
should
be
approve
without
hesitation
as
they
clearly
conform
to
cea
provision
and
cftc
regulation
and
core
principle
the
economic
purpose
to
be
serve
by
such
contract
be
overwhelming
and
the
objection
commonly
present
be
unfounded
the
cftc
rejection
a
decade
ago
of
similar
product
propose
by
nadex
involve
a
fairly
egregious
misinterpretation
of
dodd
frank
event
contract
proscription
an
error
that
not
only
disqualify
it
as
precedent
in
this
review
but
deserve
explicit
correction
as
part
of
the
commission
approval
the
commission
pose
the
follow
17
question
in
its
request
for
public
comment
paraphrase
for
brevity
1
do
the
contract
involve
game
as
describe
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
cea
these
section
do
define
gaming
of
course
but
simply
prohibit
event
contract
that
involve
gaming
leave
the
reader
or
regulator
to
figure
out
how
to
define
it
in
its
2012
order
prohibit
nadex
election
contract
the
cftc
rely
on
the
definition
of
bet
or
wager
in
usc
5362
which
include
stake
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
other
and
the
cftc
then
judge
that
an
electoral
contest
qualifie
as
such
this
aggressive
interpretation
of
the
phrase
a
contest
of
other
plainly
do
not
reflect
the
commission
own
criterion
for
application
of
reg
if
a
political
campaign
in
which
multiple
candidate
vie
for
the
prize
of
election
to
public
office
qualifie
under
this
definition
surely
contest
such
as
the
oscar
emmys
and
grammy
in
which
candidate
vie
for
literal
prize
likewise
qualify
yet
kalshi
have
previously
self
certify
and
list
numerous
contract
tie
to
these
contest
without
objection
by
the
cftc
furthermore
predictit
the
market
operate
under
no
action
relief
since
2014
while
neither
a
dcm
nor
an
sef
have
nonetheless
be
bind
by
the
product
proscription
in
reg
be
unable
to
list
contract
tie
to
most
military
activity
outcome
closely
associate
with
mortality
of
public
official
etc
yet
predictit
have
successfully
and
without
issue
list
many
thousand
of
contract
tie
to
electoral
outcome
notwithstanding
the
commission
recent
decision
to
revoke
predictit
no
action
letter
for
alleged
non
compliance
its
routine
listing
of
electoral
contest
clearly
do
not
run
afoul
of
reg
topical
prohibition
2
should
the
commission
consider
whether
election
contract
be
available
in

or
define
as

under
state
or
federal
law
federal
law
grant
the
cftc
exclusive

over

the
commission
should
resist
any
temptation
to
cede
its
jurisdiction
to
state
law
or
regulation
as
the
commission
summarize
in
a
brief
to
sdny

do
these

involve
an

that
be
unlawful
under

state
or

as
describe
in

and
section
of
the

they

the

not
the

in

no
because
as

this
be

irrelevant
the

apply
to

not
the

5
be
the

substantively
different
from
the

nadex
propose
in

such
that
the

analysis
should
be

they
be
not
substantively

the

analysis
should
be

not
because
the

be

but
because
the
commission
2012
analysis
be
incorrect
since
election
be
neither
unlawful
activity
assassination
act
of
war
nor
terrorism
reg
offer
the
commission
only
two
even
superficially
plausible
basis
on
which
to
prohibit

contract
1
that
they
constitute

address
above
or
2
that
they
fit
into
the
final
catch
all
category
of
other
similar
activity
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
catch
all
importantly
must
not
be
misinterpret
as
anything
else
determine
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public

congress
enumerate
several
specific
category
of
undesirable
activity
presumably
because
it
fear
the
consequence
of
the
potentially
perverse
incentive
for
market
participant
to
bring
about
or
at
least
profit
from
such
outcome
some
of
these
activity
however
have
notoriously
slippery
legal
definition
the
united
states
have
declare
war
in
80
year
but
it
safe
to
assume
congress
mean
to
include
plenty
of
military
activity
that
fall
outside
such
a
narrow
scope
hence
the
catch
all
also
note
that
the
phrase
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
directly
apply
to
the
underlie
activity
not
to
the
listing
of
the
contract
just
as
they
be
not
unlawful

be
not
contrary
to
the

be
the
economic
consequence
of
congressional

to
serve
a

of

do
every

have
a
demonstrable

in

hedgeable
exposure
to

but
that

be
nicely
asymmetric

not

the

of

often

but
attempt

to

carry
enormous

risk
the

of

use

and
a

surprise
arise
from

that
the

quantifiable
economic
exposure
among
natural

even
if
the

theoretical
surely
the
majority
of

currently
trade
without
controversy
or
special

on

would
fail
any
meaningful

test
but
that
do

should
disqualify

should

constrain

nonbinary

binary

can
be
