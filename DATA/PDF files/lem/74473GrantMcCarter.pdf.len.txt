I
be
write
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
propose
rule
on
event
contract
I
believe
the
proposal
be
flawed
for
several
reason
which
I
want
to
outline
below
overly
broad
definition
of
game
the
propose
rule
definition
of
gaming
be
excessively
broad
and
risk
restrict
legitimate
contract
from
be
list
for
trading
by
categorize
a
wide
array
of
activity
under
the
term
gaming
include
political
contest
and
athletic
event
the
proposal
could
inadvertently
stifle
innovation
and
limit
the
availability
of
contract
that
have
significant
commercial
value
and
utility
the
broad
scope
of
this
definition
fail
to
consider
the
legitimate
economic
purpose
that
such
contract
may
serve
potentially
hinder
market
participant
from
engage
in
beneficial
trading
activity
the
cftc
definition
of
gaming
include
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
outcome
relate
to
contest
game
involve
skill
or
chance
and
other
occurrence
connect
to
such
event
this
expansive
interpretation
could
lead
to
the
exclusion
of
contract
that
be
not
inherently
speculative
or
harmful
but
rather
serve
as
valuable
tool
for
hedging
and
risk
management
in
various
sector
for
instance
contract
base
on
political
event
or
sport
outcome
could
provide
market
participant
with
opportunity
to
hedge
against
uncertainty
in
these
area
which
be
a
legitimate
economic
activity
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
criterion
be
use
to
determine
the
inclusion
of
certain
activity
under
the
definition
of
gaming
and
how
do
these
criterion
align
with
the
economic
purpose
these
contract
may
serve
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
differentiate
between
contract
that
be
genuinely
speculative
or
harmful
and
those
that
serve
legitimate
hedging
or
risk
management
purpose
3
what
measure
will
the
cftc
implement
to
ensure
that
the
definition
of
gaming
do
not
inadvertently
stifle
innovation
or
limit
the
development
of
contract
that
could
benefit
the
market
and
its
participant
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
contract
that
would
be
consider
legitimate
under
the
propose
rule
to
clarify
the
boundary
of
the
gaming
definition
by
address
these
question
the
cftc
can
provide
great
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
support
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restrict
beneficial
trading
activity
arbitrary
and
capricious
public
interest
consideration
the
cftc
proposal
on
event
contract
introduce
a
problematic
approach
to
public
interest
consideration
by
prohibit
contract
base
on
a
predetermined
finding
that
they
be
against
the
public
interest
without
a
thorough
review
of
their
actual
term
this
blanket
prohibition
on
contract
involve
certain
activity
such
as
game
war
or
terrorism
create
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
regulatory
environment
by
not
allow
for
a
case
by
case
analysis
of
the
specific
term
and
economic
implication
of
each
contract
the
rule
could
lead
to
unjust
outcome
and
deter
market
participant
from
propose
or
list
event
contract
that
might
otherwise
be
beneficial
the
proposal
stipulate
that
contract
involve
certain
enumerate
activity
be
categorically
deem
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
prohibit
from
trading
or
clearing
on
cftc
register
derivative
exchange
this
approach
introduce
significant
uncertainty
for
exchange
and
market
participant
as
it
do
not
account
for
the
specific
economic
purpose
or
pricing
utility
of
individual
contract
the
cftc
rationale
be
to
reduce
the
internal
resource
devote
to
review
event
contract
but
this
come
at
the
cost
of
potentially
stifle
innovation
and
limit
market
opportunity
the
categorical
prohibition
without
a
detailed
analysis
of
each
contract
term
and
implication
can
lead
to
outcome
that
be
not
align
with
the
actual
risk
or
benefit
pose
by
these
contract
this
approach
may
also
discourage
market
participant
from
propose
new
contract
due
to
the
regulatory
risk
and
uncertainty
introduce
by
such
broad
prohibition
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
criterion
and
rationale
do
the
cftc
use
to
determine
that
certain
category
of
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
without
review
the
specific
term
of
each
contract
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
approach
do
not
inadvertently
deter
beneficial
contract
that
serve
legitimate
hedging
or
risk
management
purpose
3
what
mechanism
if
any
will
the
cftc
implement
to
allow
for
a
case
by
case
review
of
contract
that
fall
under
the
enumerate
activity
to
avoid
arbitrary
and
capricious
outcome
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
contract
that
would
be
consider
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
propose
rule
and
explain
the
reasoning
behind
these
determination
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
the
need
to
reduce
internal
resource
allocation
with
the
need
to
foster
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
that
support
innovation
and
economic
growth
by
address
these
question
the
cftc
can
provide
great
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
support
a
balanced
and
effective
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restrict
beneficial
trading
activity
lack
of
clear
public
interest
factor
the
cftc
proposal
lack
clear
public
interest
factor
that
would
determine
whether
a
contract
be
consider
against
the
public
interest
this
absence
of
transparency
and
specificity
in
the
rulemake
process
leave
market
participant
uncertain
about
the
criterion
use
to
evaluate
contract
without
well
define
factor
the
rule
introduce
unnecessary
regulatory
risk
and
uncertainty
which
can
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
development
and
listing
of
event
contract
market
participant
need
clear
guidance
to
understand
how
their
contract
will
be
assess
and
to
ensure
compliance
with
regulatory
standard
the
proposal
mention
several
factor
that
the
cftc
may
consider
in
determine
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
as
the
contract
utility
for
hedging
and
price
basing
purpose
its
potential
impact
on
the
public
good
and
whether
it
involve
activity
deem
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
however
these
factor
be
not
clearly
define
or
consistently
apply
lead
to
ambiguity
for
instance
the
cftc
have
historically
use
an
economic
purpose
test
to
evaluate
contract
but
this
be
remove
by
congress
and
there
be
no
long
a
statutory
requirement
for
contract
to
meet
a
hedging
or
price
basing
standard
the
lack
of
clear
guideline
leave
market
participant
guess
about
how
their
contract
will
be
judge
which
could
deter
innovation
and
the
introduction
of
potentially
beneficial
contract
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
public
interest
factor
will
the
cftc
use
to
evaluate
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
how
will
these
factor
be
consistently
apply
across
different
type
of
contract
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
the
evaluation
process
be
transparent
and
provide
sufficient
guidance
to
market
participant
about
the
criterion
use
in
determine
the
public
interest
3
will
the
cftc
consider
reinstate
the
economic
purpose
test
or
similar
criterion
to
provide
a
more
structured
framework
for
assess
the
public
interest
of
contract
and
if
not
why
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
contract
that
have
be
deem
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
propose
rule
and
explain
the
specific
factor
that
lead
to
these
determination
5
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participant
and
gather
feedback
on
the
public
interest
factor
potentially
through
roundtable
or
public
consultation
to
ensure
that
the
rule
support
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
the
propose
rule
on
event
contract
as
it
stand
could
have
detrimental
effect
on
the
market
by
impose
overly
broad
restriction
create
arbitrary
regulatory
outcome
and
lack
transparency
in
public
interest
consideration
I
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
these
aspect
of
the
proposal
to
ensure
that
it
support
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
thank
you
