future
market
the
undersigned
be
professor
who
research
and
teach
about
the
legal
economic
and
business
aspect
of
the
sport
industry
for
the
reason
set
forth
below
we
believe
that
a
blanket
prohibition
on
sport
event
future
trading
be
precipitous
the
propose
rulemaking
fail
to
consider
the
potential
public
interest
benefit
that
such
a
market
innovation
would
create
instead
the
commission
should
render
its
public
interest
determination
of
a
carefully
craft
sport
future
market
pursuant
to
its
general
regulatory
authority
to
review
specific
future
contract
trading
we
defer
to
other
regard
a
detailed
assessment
of
the
commission
authority
raise
by
commissioner
mersinger
and
pham
other
than
to
conclude
that
our
own
review
of
the
source
cite
in
the
notice
of
propose
rulemaking
persuade
we
that
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
recognize
the
public
interest
benefit
of
sport
future
trading
and
to
assess
whether
these
benefit
outweigh
the
risk
to
the
public
interest
and
the
administrative
cost
of
approve
and
oversee
sport
future
market
we
be
concerned
that
a
blanket
prohibition
on
sport
future
through
this
rulemake
proceeding
will
prevent
innovation
with
potential
to
serve
two
important
public
interest
first
as
with
other
future
market
a
sport
future
market
allow
firm
that
make
substantial
investment
reliant
for
their
profitable
return
on
the
success
of
a
particular
sport
team
such
as
sponsor
medium
company
and
business
adjacent
to
sport
event
to
hedge
their
investment
this
hedging
allow
these
firm
as
well
as
sport
club
and
league
to
increase
investment
second
and
of
perhaps
great
importance
sport
future
promote
critical
transparency
allow
both
private
actor
and
public
policymaker
to
assess
market
trend
and
to
increase
the
accountability
of
market
actor
the
latter
be
particularly
important
where
as
be
typical
in
the
sport
industry
vigorous
competition
either
in
the
product
market
or
in
the
market
for
corporate
control
be
not
available
to
facilitate
this
accountability
because
the
issue
concern
sport
future
be
quite
distinct
from
those
raise
by
event
contract
involve
election
war
or
other
world
event
we
recommend
that
any
rulemaking
exclude
sport
future
and
that
the
distinctive
issue
raise
by
sport
future
should
instead
be
consider
in
the

of
a

the

in

even
if

confirm

cite
in

the

expressly
inform

that
the

be
to

we
emphasize
that
lincoln
do
not
state
that
the
provision
would
require
the
cftc
to
prevent
whatever
she
think
might
be
gamble
through
future
market
when
combine
with
the
statutory
authorization
it
be
clear
as
the
notice
of
propose

state
elsewhere
that
the
commission
make
a
two
step
determination
as
to
whether
it
have
jurisdiction
over
certain
financial
instrument
and
whether
to
ban
such
instrument
if
their
marketing
be
contrary
to
the
public

nothing
cite
by
the
notice
of
propose

indicate
that
congress
intend
to
either
make
its
own
public
interest
determination
that
any
event
contract
with
aspect
similar
to
gaming
should
be
prohibit
or
that
the
cftc
lack
the
authority
to
balance
the
benefit
we
articulate
above
against
various
consideration
suggest
that
these
contract
might
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
similarly
the
notice
point
to
a
colloquy
between
lincoln
and
feinstein
reflect
feinstein
apparent
concern
with
situation
where
the
predominant
use
of

even
here
these
lead
senator
be
clear
that
the
text
be
be
draft
to
give
the
cftc
the
power
to
block
these
contract
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nothing
in
this
colloquy
suggest
that
either
through
rulemaking
or
individualized
assessment
the
cftc
be
require
to
make
such
a
finding
thus
even
though
the
notice
currently
observe
that
the
utility
of
a
contract
or
category
contract
for
purpose
of
hedging
and
price
basing
be
relevant
factor
in
the
public
interest
determination
there
be
no
support
in
text
or
history
for
the
conclusion
that
these
be
the
only
factor
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
the
cftc
be
to
construe
the
text
and
legislative
intent
as
require
the
commission
to
make
a
binary
choice
between
good
contract
where
the
predominant
effect
be
to
permit
firm
to
hedge
investment
and
bad
contract
where
the
predominant
effect
be
speculative
this
be
particularly
true
in
the
distinctive
case
of
sport
future
in
our
view
there
will
be
three
simultaneous
effect
of
sport
future
contract
trading
1
it
will
allow
hedging
by
those
who
make
investment
whose
return
be
significantly
affect
by
sport
event
also
likely
increase
the
willingness
of
sponsor
medium
right
purchaser
luxury
box
purchaser
and
other
to
make
these
investment
bring
further
revenue
into
sport
2
it
will
promote
great
transparency
about
the
likely
success
of
club
who
draw
upon
consumer
loyalty
and
thus
great
accountability
for
league
and
club
owner
and
3
it
will
attract
speculative
investment
by
those
who
as
in
traditional
commodity
future
market
believe
that
they
can
profit
by
a
shrewd
assessment
of
market
trend
even
if
from
a
quantitative
standpoint
the
speculative
aspect
can
be
say
to
predominate
this
do
not
mean
that
the
benefit
from
hedging
and
transparency
be
insufficient
to
render
these
market
in
the
public
interest
other
language
in
the
notice
of
propose
rulemaking
could
be
read
to
suggest
that
any
future
market
that
might
attract
investor
seek
to
trade
for
entertainment
purpose
should
be
prohibit
this
would
be
an
unfortunate
overreach
to
imaginatively
illustrate
suppose
a
television
reality
show
akin
to
dance
with
the
star
feature
celebrity
spend
time
with
those
who
earn
their
live
trading
pork
belly
future
and
the
ensue
popularity
lead
americans
to
choose
for
their
own
entertainment
to
invest
in
these
market
because
these
market
serve
important
interest
the
fact
that
part
of
the
demand
for
investment
be
base
on
entertainment
would
not
radically
change
the
public
interest
determination
the
statute
require
the
commission
to
make
notwithstanding
this
ambiguous
rhetoric
in
the
notice
it
eventually
conclude
with
an
understanding
consistent
with
the
text
and
legislative
history
the
commission
will
consider
all
relevant
factor
in
evaluate
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
there
be
no
one
factor
that
will
be
determinative
in
the
commission
evaluation
notice
at
43
the
transparency
benefit
of
sport
future
be
a
relevant
factor
that
warrant
the
commission
consideration
and
the
concern
that
sport
future
investment
could
be
motivate
by
gaming
or
entertainment
motivation
can
not
be
determinative
3
a
proceeding
be
the
preferred
process
to
explore
if
effective
regulation
of
sport
future
market
significantly
minimize
market
distortion
we
do
not
claim
that
the
benefit
in
investment
hedging
and
increase
transparency
necessarily
outweigh
the
risk
to
the
public
interest
from
effort
by
unscrupulous
individual
to
distort
decision
for
profit
in
future
market
trading
we
do
suggest
that
an
individualized
assessment
in
the
90
day
review
period
set
forth
in
of
the
cftc
regulation
would
be
a
well
way
for
the
cftc
to
determine
whether
sport
future
trading
be
in
the
public
interest
we
recognize
the
concern
express
in
the
notice
of
propose
rulemake
that
the
propose
amendment
would
reduce
the
frequency
of
event
contract
submission
to
the
commission
that
raise
potential
public
interest
concern
which
would
allow
for
more
efficient
use
of
commission
and
staff
resource
by
reduce
the
need
to
conduct
individualized
event
contract
review
pursuant
to
the
administration
of
the
cea
be
not
within
our
expertise
but
it
can
not
be
that
any
type
of
regulated
instrument
that
would
raise
potential
public
interest
concern
should
be
ban
by
rulemake
to
avoid
costly
individualized
review
the
time
consume
nature
of
individualized
review
could
be
avoid
in
the
future
if
in
the
context
of
a
review
the
commission
be
to
determine
that
all
or
virtually
all
event
contract
involve
sport
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
the
cftc
have
yet
to
make
such
a
determination
and
it
can
well
do
so
by
undertake
the
sound
investment
of
time
and
resource
into
a
few
individualized
review
before
reach
the
broad
conclusion
that
as
a
category
all
sport
event
future
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
although
for
some
investor
sport
future
trading
have
similarity
to
game
the
investment
differ
in
important
way
event
contract
can
be
limit
to
economically
relevant
long
term
event
rather
than
a
single
contest
or
a
spot
bet
on
a
single
sporting
event
the
careful
tracking
of
investment
only
make
through
register
broker
make
detection
of
market
manipulation
far
easy
than
even
regulated
gambling
market
the
penalty
for
market
manipulation
in
future
market
be
far
more
severe
more
significantly
the
risk
of
compulsive
gambling
can
also
be
police
more
effectively
in
sport
future
than
in
sport
gambling
as
the
identity
of
the
investor
be
hard
to
disguise
and
those
who
should
not
be
allow
to
participate
either
because
of
industry
involvement
or
because
of
compulsive
tendency
can
be
more
readily
enforce

the
public
interest
analysis
for
election
future
differ
from
sport
future
in
four
fundamental
respect
first
the
risk
of
election
distortion
be
far
great
than
the
risk
that
sporting
competition
will
be
distort
by
future
trading
there
already
exist
a
massive
sport
gambling
market
that
create
incentive
for
unscrupulous
individual
to
distort
market
no
such
market
exist
regard
election
second
there
be
a
distinctive
public
interest
in
a
function
democracy
where
voter
cast
ballot
for
candidate
whose
policy
they
prefer
not
candidate
whose
victory
will
profit
they
in
a
future
market
there
be
no
such
interest
or
concern
if
a
lifelong
yankee
fan
choose
to
short
the
yankee
or
go
long
on

therefore

run
over

similarly
as
feinstein
note
in
legislative
debate
there
be
a
particular
public
interest
concern
with
contract
that
would
allow
someone
to
profit
from

that
threaten

national

such

when

third
the
transparency
benefit
provide
by
sport
future
market
be
far
great
than
those
of
election
future
politic
already
feature
significant
transparency
as
rival
candidate
the
medium
and
pervasive
public
polling
provide
citizen
with
the
assessment
of

and
the
sort
of
information
that
future

provide
political
competition
provide
ample
opportunity
without
the
need
for

contrast

no
such

conclusion
the
