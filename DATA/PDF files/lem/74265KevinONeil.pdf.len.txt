comment
on
the
cftc
propose
rule
to
prohibit
election
event
contract
I
be
write
to
express
my
deep
concern
and
strong
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
propose
rule
to
prohibit
election
event
contract
this
proposal
represent
a
significant
overreach
of
the
cftc
regulatory
authority
and
demonstrate
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
valuable
role
these
market
play
in
our
financial
ecosystem
and
democratic
process
I
urge
the
commission
to
reject
this
proposal
and
instead
engage
in
a
more
thoughtful
collaborative
approach
with
industry
stakeholder
to
address
any
concern
while
preserve
the
numerous
benefit
these
market
provide
regulatory
overreach
and
misinterpretation
of
authority
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
election
event
contract
go
far
beyond
its
congressional
mandate
and
represent
a
troubling
expansion
of
regulatory
power
the
commission
attempt
to
classify
these
contract
as
mere
gaming
ignore
their
legitimate
economic
purpose
and
contradict
the
cftc
own
previous
position
on
event
contract
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
grant
the
cftc
authority
to
regulate
derivative
market
to
ensure
their
integrity
and
protect
market
participant
however
it
do
not
give
the
commission
carte
blanche
to
prohibit
entire
class
of
contract
that
serve
valid
economic
function
by
propose
this
ban
the
cftc
be
effectively
rewrite
its

a
dangerous

election
event
contract
provide
a
crucial
tool
for
business
and
individual
to
hedge
against
these
political
risk
for
instance
1
a
renewable
energy
company
might
use
these
contract
to
hedge
against
the
risk
of
policy
change
that
could
affect
subsidy
or
regulation
2
an
international
business
could
use
they
to
manage
currency
risk

to
potential
trade
policy
shift
3
investor

use

protect
their
portfolio
against

uncertainty
by
ban
these

the
cftc
would
be
eliminate

important

tool

increase
systemic
risk
in
the
financial

price
discovery
and

to
understand
the
likely
outcome
of

the
cftc

system
the
need
for

engagement
the
cftc
proposal
have
be
meet
with
significant
criticism
from
industry
participant

even
some
within
the

this
backlash
underscore
the
need
for
a
more
collaborative
approach
to
regulation
instead
of
impose
a
unilateral
ban
the
cftc
should
1
engage
in
meaningful
dialogue
with

operator

and
academic
expert
to
fully
understand
the
benefit
and
potential
risk
of

contract
2
explore
alternative
regulatory
framework
that
address
any
legitimate
concern

market
3
consider
the
potential
unintended
consequence
of
a
ban
such
as
drive
trading
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
market
which
could
pose
great
risk
to
market
participant
and
reduce
transparency
conclusion
and
call
to
action
the
cftc
propose
ban
on
election

be
an
unnecessary
and
potentially
harmful
overreach

proposal

stakeholder
consultation
