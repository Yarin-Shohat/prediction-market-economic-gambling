we

significant
concern
with
both

the

the

would
effect
a

introduction
we
strongly
encourage
the
commission
to
withdraw
the
proposal
not
only
do
we
disagree
with
its
substance
we
also
believe
it
go
beyond
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
to
prohibit
entire
category
of
contract
instead
of
allow
prediction
market
to
develop
and
flourish
within
the
regulatory
protection
of
the
cea
and
commission
regulation
and
thereby
provide
new
avenue
for
price
discovery
and
hedging
of
economically
consequential
event
the
commission
be
propose
to
ban
they
under
a
mistaken
belief
that
it
be
protect
american
customer
from
harm
the
cea
give
designate
contract
market
dcms
broad
leeway
to
list
event
contract
use
a
self
certification
process
but
also
prohibit
a
dcm
from
list
any
event
contract
that
the
commission
determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
in
section
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
assassination
war
terrorism
gaming
in
other
word
follow
a
two
step
process
the
commission
must
first
find
that
the
event
contract
involvesˮ
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
game
and
then
subsequently
determine
that
the
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
plain
language
interpretation
of
the
statute
be
consistent
with
the
current
commission
approach
of
make
these
determination
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
the
proposal
seek
to
deviate
from
this
longstanding
and
well
establish
practice
in
its
place
the
commission
propose
to
use
its
rulemake
authority
to
define
the
term
gamingˮ
to
incorporate
event
that
go
well
beyond
a
plain
meaning
of
that
term
and
by
do
so
categorically
deny
a
dcm
the
ability
to
list
contract
that
reference
they
regardless
of
whether
any
particular
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
while
the
cea
permit
the
commission
to
write
rule
that
cover
similar
activity
this
approach
be
wrong
it
remove
important
discretion
that
should
be
afford
to
both
the
commission
and
market
participant
with
respect
to
future
listing
determination
we
firmly
believe
that
this
all
or
nothing
approach
to
the
treatment
of
event
contract
be
not
consistent
with
the
promotion
of
responsible
innovation
and
growth
in
regulated
transparent
market
with
appropriate
safeguard
to
protect
market
integrity
and
protect
customer
our
core
concern
be
the
proposalʼs
overly
broad
definition
of
if
adopt
rule
would
capture
contract
as
gamingˮ
that
by
any
common
understanding
be
not
in
fact
gaming
few
would
agree
that
election
or
professional
award
such
as
nobel
prize
or
academy
award
be
grant
through
a
process
that
should
generally
qualify
as
game
yet
these
be
the
example
present
as
constitute
such
a
definition
as
we
describe
in
more
detail
below
this
be
inconsistent
with
both
the
cea
and
the
support
legislative
history
relate
to
game
neither
of
which
suggest
that
gaming
should
extend
beyond
sporting
event
a
consequence
of
the
overly
broad
definition
be
that
many
economically
viable
contract
would
be
prohibit
for
reason
contrary
to
a
public
interest
find
this
be
a
mistake
critically
the
proposal
fail
to
recognize
the
value
of
prediction
market
the
proposal
question
their
scientific
merit
and
highlight
their
potential
to
harm
investor
but
without
cite
evidence
to
support
these
conclusion
instead
the
proposal
lament
that
event
contract
do
not
work
like
those
that
the
commission
be
familiar
with
because
the
event
contract
do
not
have
underlie
cash
market
and
that
somehow
this
innovation
be
inconsistent
with
a
public
interest
proposal
at
48982
it
be
also
incumbent
on
the
commission
to
meet
its
statutory
obligation
set
forth
in
cea
section
to
fully
account
for
the
cost
and
benefit
to
market
participant
of
prohibit
event
contract
include
the
impact
on
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
future

7
the
proposal
fail
to
do
this
which
be
a
shortcoming
that
need
to
be
correct
as
discuss
below
the
commission
fail
to
recognize
the
important
risk
management
tool
event
contract
can
provide
as
well
as
other
important
public
interest
consideration
describe
in
this
response
instead
the
proposal
exclusively
focus
on
the
lack
of
commission
resource
to
conduct
a
contract
by
contract
review
via
the
self
certification
process
and
how
this
will
also
save
market
participant
compliance
resource
because
they
will
not
have
to
bother
list
product
proposal
at
48972
we
disagree
that
this
be
an
appropriate
basis
for
the
commissionʼs
propose
categorical
ban
the
commission
and
congress
should
instead
focus
on
ensure
the
commission
have
the
need
resource
to
continue
its
self
certificationˮ
process
that
have
by
all
account
work
well
across
industry
and
market
type
to
the
extent
the
commission
believe
that
it
must
move
forward
with
this
rulemake
the
focus
should
not
be
on
a
broad
definition
of
gaming
instead
the
commission
should
focus
on
type
of
event
contract
that
be
sufficiently
similar
to
each
other
such
that
the
commission
be
able
to
conduct
a
comprehensive
public
interest
analysis
applicable
to
all
potential
contract
of
that
type
only
if
the
commission
can
then
demonstrate
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
meet
all
statutory
requirement
in
make
that
determination
should
those
contract
be
prohibit
under
commission
rule
along
with
certain
contract
reference
terrorism
assassination
gaming
and
war
the
commission
should
not
review
event
contract
on
a
categorical
basis
the
commission
suggest
that
it
be
not
require
to
make
a
public
interest
determination
on
a
contract
specific
basis
and
that
the
cea
authorize
categorical
public
interest
determination
proposal
at
48978
we
disagree
the
commissionʼs
proposal
to
review
contract
as
a
category
be
not
contemplate
by
the
cea
depart
from
long
stand
practice
in
commission
regulate
market
and
would
harm
innovation
in
event
contract
market
while
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
think
about
category
of
contract
in
develop
principle
with
which
to
inform
their
determination
adopt
a
broad
categorical
determination
approach
to
event
contract
be
a
flawed
method
to
review
novel
product
and
risk
upend
the
commissionʼs
longstanding
product
review
framework
for
the
follow
reason
we
believe
the
proposalʼs
approach
exceed
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
first
congress
do
not
direct
the
commission
to
define
gamingˮ
in
cea
section
clearly
evidence
by
the
very
next
subclause

section
which
provide
that
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulationˮ
can
determine
whether
other
similar
activityˮ
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
second
the
proposal
fail
to
establish
a
basis
for
an
overly
expansive
definition
of
the
proposalʼs
definition
be
broad
than
what
can
be
reasonably
establish
base
on
the
legislative
history
and
remark
by
legislator
nowhere
do
the
legislative
history
suggest
that
gaming
include
election
award
or
even
contest
more
generally
outside
of
sporting
event
instead
the
commission
seem
to
be
take
the
approach
that
gaming
be
not
only
speculative
but
that
speculation
itself
be
game
and
therefore
a
rational
basis
for
expand
the
set
of
event
that
qualify
as
game
the
proposal
wholly
fail
to
clearly
articulate
a
basis
for
distinguish
certain
behavior
as
market
speculationˮ
and
other
activity
as
gamingˮ
or
finally
nowhere
do
the
statute
indicate
that
all
gaming
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
the
contrary
the
statute
authorize
the
commission
to
prohibit
only
game
contract
that
it
deem
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
commission
otherwise
believe
that
an
event
contract
outside
of
those
already
enumerate
in
the
statute
involve
specific
activity
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
should
then
make
that
determination
by
rule
or
regulationˮ
as
provide
by
cea
section
for
these
reason
the
commissionʼs
propose
approach
of
establish
a
broad
definition
of
gamingˮ
and
then
prohibit
contract
that
fit
under
that
definition
be
statutorily
infirm
if
the
commission
do
not
take
a
more
tailored
approach
the
rule
will
inevitably
be
use
to
reject
new
type
of
event
contract
for
which
a
dcm
could
otherwise
make
a
viable
public
interest
argument
through
the
well
establish
self
certification
process
have
such
broad
authority
be
exercise
in
the
past
it
could
have
prevent
for
example
the
introduction
of
financial

should
the
commission
have
conclude
in
its
nascent
day
that
it
do
not
have
adequate
economic
purpose
or
public
interest
benefit
in
the
case
of
event
contract
we
do
not
believe
that
this
commission
should
handcuff
the
discretion
of
future
commission
by
make
sweeping
determination
about
a
market
that
be
at
the
early
stage
of
development
and
maturation
more
to
the
point
the
current
process
for

be
not
break
the
commission
have
historically

explanation
and

follow
their

moreover
as

we

the
literature
on
prediction
market
go
well
beyond
these
example
and
the
commission
should
understand
what
it
say
before
make
any
determination
about
the
treatment
of
any
class
of
contract
within
its
authority
this
would
not
only
help
prevent
mistake
like
we
believe
would
occur
under
this
proposal
but
also
would
give
the
commission
an
opportunity
to
consider
way
to
improve
event
contract
market
quality
and
promote
access
to
these
market

they
generate
by

economically

to
materialize
in

and
by
virtue
of
the
result
be
publicly
available
prediction
market
can
democratize
access
to
information
that
would
otherwise
be
only
available
to
a
subset
of
well
fund
market
participant
these
measure
can
have
pro
competitive
effect
on
the
economy
as
information
do
not
remain
siloe
within
a
single
firm
with
the
resource
to
acquire
accurate
forecast
on
their
own
account
public
availability
can
thus
create
a
separate
public
benefit
that
accrue
not
only
to
those
who
trade
the
commission
fail
entirely
to
consider
this
in
its
analysis
such
an
approach

three
factor
to

1
the
extent
to
which
the
contract

category
of
contract
would
draw
the
commission
into
area
outside
of
its
primary
regulatory
remit
2
whether
characteristic
of
the
contract
or
category
of
contact
may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relate
to
the
trading
or
pricing
of
the
contract
and
3
whether
the
contract
or
category
of
contract
could
result
in
market
participant
profit
from
harm
to
any
person
or
group
of
person
proposal
at

it
be
unclear
why
these
factor
be
need
the
commissionʼs
general
core
principle
regulatory
approach
for
trading
venue
already
promote
these
goal
for
example
designate
contract
market
be
require
to
make
information
publicly
available
which
align
with
some
of
the
many
public
benefit
of

additionally
dcms
have
obligation
as
self
regulatory
organization
make
they
well
suited
to
establish
and
enforce
standard
that
promote
market
integrity
through
its
surveillance
and
authority
to
investigate
and
deter
abusive
trading
practice
like
fraud
and
manipulation
it
be
also
unclear
why
any
of
the
legislative
history
cite
in
the
proposal
should
change
the
exist
listing
process
or
how
many
of
the
enumerate
activity
that
the
proposal
attempt
to
capture
through
its
broad
definition
of
game
nobel
and
pulitzer
prize
oscar
election
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
many
of
the
event
contract
propose
to
be
prohibit
have
bona
fide
economic
value
beyond
speculation
and
we
disagree
with
the
commision
statement
while
there
may
be
individual
or
entity
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequence
the
commission
believe
that
any
such
segment
of
individual
or
entity
be
likely
to
be
narrow
as
compare
to
the
broad
universe
of
market
participant
include
retail
market
participant
who
may
be
able
to
trade
in
an
event
contract
list
on
a
cftc
register
exchange
and
who
the
commission
believe
be
most
likely
to
trade
such
contract
for
entertainment
purpose
only
I
d
at
48982
to
the
contrary
the
commission
have
make
no
attempt
to
assess
the
potential
economic
consequence
of
the
proposal
outside
of
compliance
implication
instead
the
commission
make
sweeping
and
unsubstantiated
statement
about
the
speculative
nature
of
event
contract
suggest
that
they
would
be
of
little
economic
value
and
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
investor
the
only
reference
to
research
that
we
find
in
the
proposal
be
in
reference
to
the
potential
impact
of
fake
news
reporting
and
potential
manipulation
of
the
contract
it
could
be
use
to
distort
the
information
underlie
price
formation
in
such
event
I
d
at
48983
we
donʼt
discount
that
fake
newsˮ
and
misinformation
can
distort
market
price
this
be
true
today
for
all
financial
market
instrument
that
trade
on
regulate
exchange
and
not
unique
to
any
one
market
include
prediction
market
and
somewhat
ironically
unlike
with
any
other
market
prediction
market
be
particularly
well
suited
to
address
the
problem
of
fake
news
in
particular
prediction
market
be
not
static
but
continually
update
so
if
investor
be
fool
at
any
one
time
in
the
case
of
the
article
by
a
fake
poll
that
will
be
quickly
correct
by
the
ongoing
incentive
or
price
discovery
so
the
evidence
the
proposal
cite
be
exactly
one
of
the
reason
why
a
well
regulate
prediction
market
would
be
good
in
the
long
run
for
the
economy
it
be
also
not
clear
how
confusion
or
risk
will
be
sow
with
retail
investor
about
event
that
be
often
much
more
easily
understand
than
many
financial
contract
for
example
it
be
hard
to
argue
that
an
event
contract
on
who
will
win
the
next
presidential
election
or
the
nobel
prize
be
hard
to
understand
than
a
future
contract
on
corn
moreover
it
be
a
false
premise
for
the
commission
to
say
or
believe
that
other
thing
it
could
improperly
signal
to
certain
retail
investor
that
these
contract
be
instrument
to
be
use
for
investment
purpose
ˮ
when
the
nature
of
the
contract
be
very
easy
to
understand
and
the
contract
can
in
fact
be
use
for
investment
purpose
this
be
even
true
for
sporting
event
a
vendor
cost
of

of
a

a

can
be

by

a
position
in

of
that
teamʼs
loss
summary
we
recommend
in
light
of
the
consideration
we
highlight
in
our
letter
that
the
commission
abandon
the
proposal
rather
than
prohibit
event

that
involve

should
the

otherwise
decide
to
move
forward
with

rule
we
strongly
urge
the
commission
to
repropose

from
our
belief
that
this

overstep
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
the

so
would
provide
