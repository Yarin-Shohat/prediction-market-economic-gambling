the
cftc
focus
on
the
meaning
give
by
the
second
circuit
to
the
word
commodity

argue
that
it
have
jurisdiction
over
commodity
that
commodity
mean
virtually
every

or

accord
to
the
cftc
event
contract
have
be
base
on
a
wide

of

include
the
result
of
presidential

the

world
population
level
the
adoption
of

of
legislation
the
outcome
of

sale
the
declaration
of
war
and
the
length
of
celebrity
marriage
at
sixteen
year
later
the
cftc
have
not
yet
undertake
an
event
contract
rulemake
the
cftc
assertion
of
plenary
jurisdiction
be
especially
dangerous
in
the
context
of
event
contract
for
which
the
cftc
have
yet
to
express
clear
rule
take
one
of
the
event
contract
posit
by
the
cftc
the
length
of
a
celebrity
marriage
perhaps
it
would
be
reasonably
within
the
scope
of
investigate
market
manipulation
if
the
celebrity
attorney
or
accountant
have
a
position
in
the
contract
or
one
of
the
couple
be
photograph
in
public
be
intimate
with
a
non
spouse
but
base
on
the
cftc
state
position
in
its
order
here
include
an
ability
to
question
why
someone
vote
as
he
or
she
do
ar
20
it
seem
that
the
cftc
would
claim
jurisdiction
to
step
in
even
when
there
be
other
government
entity
that
regulate
the
activity
such
as
to
determine
when
and
whether
there
be
a
divorce
or
whether
the
ground
for
divorce
be
proper
or
consider
the
case
of
an
event
contract
on
the
population
of
a
city
cftc
claim
would
presumably
include
authority
to
investigate
for
market
manipulation
for
example
a
person
with
a
long
position
in
the
contract
who
advocate
against
abortion
the
cftc
have
elsewhere
seem
to
assert
that
its
jurisdiction
to
investigate
manipulation
be
not
limit
to
transaction
in
commodity
but
also
includes
claim
personal
us
of
commodity
for
example
one
cftc
commissioner
claim
that
the
cftc
have
authority
to
investigate
fraud
with

to

by
this
logic
the
cftc
would
have
the
authority
to
investigate
fraud
with
respect
to
the
purported
health
benefit
of
vaccine
and
why
stop
with
purport
benefit
if
the
cftc
have
the
power
to
investigate
fraud
with
respect
to
any
aspect
of
any
commodity
the
cftc
jurisdiction
be
virtually
unlimited
especially
when
commodity
mean
everything
the
breadth
of
power
claim
by
the
cftc
could
mean
that
if
an
election
change
control
of
congress
in
a
way
the
cftc
dislike
it
could
investigate
that
election
as
manipulation
of
the
event
contract
and
before
an
election
a
government
ability
to
regulate
and
investigate
opinion
polling
could
be
abuse
to
stay
in
power
ar
1062
this
court
should
thus
consider
whether
the
cftc
actual
jurisdiction
and
investigative
authority
in
administer
these
contract
match
what
the
cftc
claim
ii
the
cftc
order
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
its
order
here
the
cftc
say
that
the
binary
payout
of
the
congressional
control
contract
far
limit
their
utility
as
a
vehicle
for
hedge
any
eventual
economic
effect
result
from
which
party
control
a
chamber
of
congress
ar
18
this
make
no
sense
and
be
contradict
by
the
record
which
provide
evidence
that
binary
payout
enhance
hedge
utility
for
example
a
company
that
face
a
risk
from
one
political
party
but
not
the
other
ar
1054
55
if
only
one
party
present
a
risk
there
be
no
need
for
a
payout
if
the
other
party
be
not
in
power
thus
binary
payout
be
appropriate
and
effective
at
mitigate
