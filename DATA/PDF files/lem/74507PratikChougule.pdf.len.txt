the
need
for
cftc
rulemake
on
event
contract
we
support
the
commission
decision
to
initiate
a
notice
of
propose
rulemake
on
event
contract
as
a
means
of
provide
regulatory
clarity
certainty
and
stability
in
the
space
the
cftc
remain
the
federal
agency
well
position
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
event
contract
since
1992
when
cftc
register
exchange
increase
their
listing
of
event
contract
the
commission
have
gradually
expand
its
jurisdiction
over
the
space
it
be
true
that
event
contract
do
not
fall
within
the
core
regulatory
remit
of
the
cftc
we
agree
for
instance
that
key
aspect
of
event
contract
regulation
would
be
a
well
fit
for
a
gaming
regulator
but
congress
address
the
cftc
authority
over
event
contract
as
part
of
the
doddfrank
act
have
look
to
the
commission
since
then
for
leadership
on
the
issue
and
have
show
little
indication
to
roll
back
the
commission
jurisdiction
the
above
point
regard
the
cftc
authority
over
event
contract
be
critical
consider
how
frequently
the
propose
rule
raise
concern
about
the
commission
lack
of
specialized
experience
and
jurisdiction
on
question
relate
to
event
contract
too
often
in
the
propose
amendment
the
commission
cite
perceive
limitation
in
term
of
its
expertise
and
authority
as
a
reason
for
curtail
event
contract
ironically
as
underscore
by
commissioner
mersinger
and
pham
the
commission
may
be
overcorrecte
by
exceed
its
legal
authority
in
restrict
event
contract
give
the
absence
of
a
well
situated
agency
the
commission
should
instead
err
on
the
side
of
build
the
capacity
within
the
agency
to
manage
event
contract
and
articulate
to
lawmaker
and
judge
why
an
update
legal
regime
be
necessary
to
regulate
the
evolve
event
contract
space
the
cftc
should
draw
confidence
from
the
way
its
historic
regulation
over
event
contract
have
allow
the
space
to
mature
although
the
cftc
have
take
a
restrictive
and
cautious
approach
to
regulate
event
contract
it
have
also
provide
enough
leeway
for
the
space
to
develop
even
though
the
cftc
be
bind
by
a
regime
in
which
the
preponderance
of
federal
and
state
law
militate
against
event
contract
the
agency
be
a
relative
outlier
among
its
international
counterpart
in
term
of
how
much
it
have
permit
event
contract
to
be
offer
on
regulate
exchange
platform
with
no
action
relief
and
offshore
site
the
iowa
electronic
market
and
predictit
as
an
example
would
not
have
operate
with
regulatory
certainty
in
the
absence
of
the
cftc
no
action
letter
the
success
of
these
project
have
inspire
entrepreneur
to
build
event
contract
platform
of
great
sophistication
and
value
for
the
public
interest
we
disagree
with
those
who
believe
that
this
rulemaking
be
inherently
problematic
for
the
event
contract
space
in
light
of
the
commission
reservation
although
we
would
favor
a
more
laissez
faire
approach
to
event
contract
than
what
the
commission
have
pursue
we
believe
that
a
lack
of
regulatory
certainty
and
clarity
be
perhaps
as
great
an
obstacle
to
the
development
of
the
event
contract
space
as
be
regulation
themselves
the
absence
of
clear
rule
have
harm
the

the

factor

the

that

grow
at
the

time
that
they
face

scrutiny
in

the
one
that

at
the
same
time
the
promise
of
event
contract
be
be
realize
in
unprecedented
way
event
contract
relate
to
election
and
politic
be
thrive
primarily
due
to
the
effort
of
company
that
be
not
register
as
dcms
that
be
not
pursue
no
action
relief
from
the
cftc
we
believe
that
these
market
would
be
more
efficient
if
they
operate
with
legal
certainty
and
be
more
directly
accessible
to
american
user
but
even
with
these
limitation
the
diversity
of
market
that
be
now
available
and
the
volume
participation
and
attention
they
be
draw
would
be
impossible
on
a
dcm
even
under
the
most
laissez
faire
of
commission
we
continue
to
believe
that
event
contract
on
election
and
other
political
event
far
the
public
interest
however
we
disagree
with
advocate
of
event
contract
who
be
encourage
the
cftc
to
expend
political
capital
stretch
its
authority
and
test
the
limit
of
the
law
by
permit
a
wide
array
of
political
event
contract
this
be
because
the
great
threat
to
political
event
contract
no
long
come
from
cftc
regulation
more
concern
be
the
possibility
that
highly
visible
deliberation
on
the
issue
at
the
cftc
will
harden
legal
precedent
against
event
contract
and
invite
sweep
restriction
by
congress
that
usurp
the
cftc
prerogative
to
promote
responsible
innovation
in
the
event
contract
space
we
fear
likewise
that
enforcement
arm
of
the
government
will
seek
to
crack
down
not
only
against
company
offer
event
contract
but
also
user
on
these
platform
indeed
the
highly
restrictive
legal
regime
in
which
event
contract
be
mire
come
about
as
a
consequence
of
overzealous
industry
whose
poor
judgment
provoke
regulatory
backlash
in
the
form
of
law
such
as
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
and
dodd
frank
we
therefore
encourage
the
commission
to
propose
amendment
that
be
not
only
consistent
with
the
law
but
be
also
attuned
to
a
political
environment
in
which
ignorance
strong
moral
intuition
and
unfavorable
news
cycle
can
lead
to
overreaction
on
emotionally
charge
issue
such
as
election
betting
provide
that
the
commission
adopt
the
revision
we
detail
below
we
believe
that
the
propose
amendment
will
prevent
regulatory
backlash
allow
select
event
contract
to
operate
on
dcms
provide
non
register
entity
with
space
to
innovate
and
support
industry
actor
in
their
effort
to
navigate
regulation
in
the
space
the
definition
of
gaming
as
note
in
the
propose
amendment
the
definition
of
gaming
as
it
pertain
to
event
contract
be
ambiguous
while
we
favor
as
a
policy
matter
a
relatively
narrow
definition
of
gaming
we
believe
that
each
of
the
commissioner
as
well
as
lawyer
represent
the
cftc
kalshi
and
various
public
interest
group
have
all
offer
reasonable
argument
that
will
be
adjudicate
in
the
federal
court
for
the
foreseeable
future
as
these
deliberation
proceed
we
would
encourage
the
commission
to
provide
clarity
on
two
of
the
most
important
type
of
event
contract
that
could
be
prohibit
under
an
expansive
definition
of
gaming
mention
market
one
be
mention
market
among
the
most
important
event
contract
for
the
public
interest
be
those
that
ask
whether
political
leader
will
say
certain
word
on
occasion
such
as
debate
and
speech
mention
by
political
candidate
of
certain
company
legislation
and
policy
agenda
can
provide
critical
clue
for
market
participant
seek
to
hedge
or
otherwise
navigate
economic
risk
this
be
particularly
true
consider
how
sensitive
financial
market
can
be
to
the
word
of
political
candidate
we
would
encourage
the
commission
to
indicate
clearly
that
these
market
do
not
constitute
gaming
under
the
final
approve
amendment
legal
market
the
second
be
market
on
the
outcome
of
legal
case
we
be
pleased
to
see
that
the
commission
permit
kalshi
to
offer
market
on
the
outcome
of
court
decision
which
be
highly
pertinent
to
the
public
interest
4
we
be
concerned
however
that
an
expansive
reading
of
the
amendment
could
interpret
court
case
as
constitute
a
contest
of
other
thereby
run
afoul
of
the
commission
definition
of
game
the
commission
should
explicitly
indicate
which
type
of
legal
market
be
permissible
relatedly
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
commission
to
explain
why
legal
market
be
acceptable
notwithstanding
the
perverse
financial
incentive
they
can
create
among
a
small
number
of
highly
influential
insider
other
event
contract
be
prohibit
on
these
ground
despite
the
fact
that
the
allege
perverse
incentive
to
manipulate
or
degrade
the
integrity
of
democratic
institution
be
considerably
weak
in
these

as

to
be

we
be

that
the

to
the
contrary
we
be
hop
that
the
commission
will
bring
great
clarity
and
consistency

treat

we
strongly
disagree
with

proposal
resurrection
of
the

which
have
limit
relevance
to

the
proposal
rely
heavily
on
a
colloquy
between

in
2010
there
be
little
evidence
that
either

incidental

likewise
in
the
current
proposal
the
commission
concede
that
approval
of
the
propose

may
result
in
the
loss
of
informational
value
the
question
of
how

to
the
public

call
for
a
test
that
be
far
more
holistic
comprehensive
and
nuanced
than
the
economic
purpose
test
our
recommendation
be
for
the
commission
to
oversee
a
separate
rulemaking
process
to
determine
an
appropriate
test
on
whether
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
believe
that
the
rulemaking
should
convene
after
the
2024
election
the
commission
at
this
point
would
benefit
from
comment
that
draw

it
make
little
sense

we
why
the
commission
be
explicitly
opt
in
the
proposal
not
to
define
war
in
many
of
the
most
consequential
conflict
in
the
world
it
be
unclear
whether
a
war
be
even
occur
without
a
definition
of
war
event
contract
platform
will
have
little
guidance
on
whether
they
can
offer
market
relate
to
a
wide
array
of
current
event
propose
a
clear
narrow
definition
of
war
would
help
mitigate
the
possibility
that
a
cftc
regulate
market
would
create
a
financial
incentive
to
carry
out
an
act
of
war
the
cftc
as
an
example
could
define
war
as
a
type
of
conflict
that
could
only
be
initiate
by
designate
leader
of
a
country
through
formal
define
government
process
it
be
highly
unlikely
that
political
figure
decision
making
at
this
level
would
be
motivate
by
an
opportunity
to

illicitly
from
a
small

in

they

the

not
sufficiently
consider
that

could
be
design
in

that
would

migrant

by

conflict
be
a
source
of
economic
risk
it
be
difficult
to
see
how
an
event
contract
on
a
question
like
the
number
of
refugee
enter
a

would
create
incentive
for
market
participant
to
carry

a

in

much
less
how

on

yet
these
contract
would
facilitate
price
basing
hedging
and
other
useful

in

of
the

we
assume
this
be
why
the
commission
already
permit

to

a

on
the

of

the
ongoing

between

illustrate
the
above
dilemma
whether
or
not
the

be
a
matter
of
debate
in

of

we

encourage

until

event

on
the
2024
election
will
provide
unprecedented
datum
and
insight
that
should
inform
the

deliberation
we
recommend
that
the

provide
the
public
with
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
the

base
on
an
understanding
of
how
political
bet
market
perform
in
the
election
for
the
amendment
to
achieve
their
state
goal
of
create
regulatory
clarity
they
will
need
a
strong
bipartisan
political
mandate
this
will
be
difficult
to
achieve
without
know
the
outcome
of
the
2024
presidential
election
this
election
be
unique
in
the
sense
that
one
of
the
major
party
candidate
be
a
former
president
whose
administration
oversaw
landmark
reform
in
the
regulation
of

president

in
the
way
he
openly

odd
on

trail
more
so
than
any
recent

a
contest

would
be
a
referendum
on
how
the
american
people
see
the

of

difference
among
the
current

fuel

the

be
divide
on
the

along

line
and
that
reform
in
the

be
subject

depend
on
the

of
the

while
we
agree
with
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
sentiment
in
the
open
meeting
that
the
commissioner
do
not
think
about
these
issue
through
partisan
filter
the
reality
be
that
the
historically
non
partisan
issue
of

regulation
have
in
fact
become
more
ridden
by
partisan
divide
in
recent
year
as
see
by
the
comment
the

have
receive

we
believe
that
it
will
be
easy
for
the
commission
to
find
great
consensus
on
the
issue
after
the
2024
election
regardless
of
the
outcome
the
commission
be
more
likely
to
garner
public
approval
for

and
lie
the
groundwork
for
a
durable
regulatory
regime
if
it

for
the

similar

have

some
such
as
the

have

not
surprisingly
the

do
not
even
make
pass

outside

we

have

this

not

one

tell

that

now
regard

be

the

should
respond
directly
to
the

it
have

a

of

it

even
if

for

market
this
create
an
incentive
for
register
entity
to
offer
event
contract
that
be
ostensibly
about
economic
or
financial
indicator
but
be
so
highly
correlate
with
election
that
they
function
as
proxy
for
election
contract
the
commission
should
clarify
what
its
current
position
be
on
this
issue
and
how
the
propose
amendment
would
speak
to
this
question
give
the
ease
with
which
correlate
market
can
be

and
market
we
be
skeptical
that
the

could
effectively
regulate
they
out
of
existence
at
least
in
a
resource
efficient
manner
at
most
a
restrictive
cftc
rule
on
the

might
create
transaction
cost
for

operator
in

information

enforcement
the
propose
amendment
would
provide
clarity
for
the
relatively
small
number
of
market
operator
that
be
commit
to
play
by
the
cftc
rule
incline
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
in
their
self
regulatory
responsibility
and
willing
to
expend
the
resource
necessary
to
seek
commission
approval
in
our
estimation
there
be
currently
only
one
market
operator
kalshi
that
fit
this
profile
an
irony
of
the
cftc
approach
to
event
contract
be
that
kalshi
more
than
any
other
market
operator
in
the
space
have
be
stymie
by
the
commission
those
platform
that
have
choose
not
to
register
with
the
cftc
and
avoid
or
evade
commission
rule
have
be
among
the
big
winner
in
the
space
the
demand
for
event
contract
create
incentive
for
market
operator
to
facilitate
investment
of
dubious
legality
by
offer
the
maximum
number
of
market
possible
and
by
engage
in
minimal
effort
when
it
come
to
enforce
requirement
relate
to

false

manipulation
market
integrity
and
other
cftc
concern
this
dynamic
be
among
the
factor
that
lead
to
litigation
between
the
cftc
and
predictit
while

the
rule
would
impact
the
event
contract
space
the
way
that
the
rule
be
enforce
in
our
judgment
will
prove
to
be
the
more
significant
factor
affect
how
event
contract
influence
the
public
interest
discussion
of
enforcement
be
conspicuously
absent
in
the
propose
text
as
see
from
the
commission
open
meeting
on
may
10
it
be
not
just
market
participant
but
also
the
commissioner
themselves
that
lack
clarity
on
the
enforcement
implication
of
the
rule
we
agree
with
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
that
the
refusal
of
the
cftc
enforcement
division
to
attend
the
meeting
be
very
disappointing
unacceptable
and
a
dereliction
of
their
duty
as
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
indicate
the
brief
statement
that
the

submit
do
not
allow
for

the
enforcement
division
absence
speak
to
large
issue
with
the
proposal
generally
it
seem
to
legitimate
the
point
commissioner
pham
make
in
the
open
hearing
as
well
as
her
dissent
about
the
need
for
reform
in
term
of
how
the
commission
be
handle
rulemake
process
specific
to
event
contract
it
indicate
that
the
commission
be
rive
with
internal
disagreement
this
be
neither
surprising
nor
problematic
per
se
give
the
complexity
and
uncertainty
associate
with
the
issue
indeed
the
absence
of
disagreement
would
point
to
a
more
concern
lack
of
reflection
the
lack
of
agreement
within
the
agency
do
however
call
for
the
commission
to
take
a
slow
more
deliberative
approach
to
the
propose
amendment
without
a
consensus
between
the
commissioner
the
staff
and
the
enforcement
division
of
the
cftc
the
commission
will
not
be
able
to
generate
enough
buy
in
for
the
proposal
to
create
stability
in
the
space
event
contract
regulation
will
instead
be
see
as
a
tentative
political
question
that
be
up
for
grab
depend
on
the
outcome
of
election
and
the
make
up
of
the
commission
at
any
give
point
rely
on
tip
and
referral
from
market
participant
for
the
underlie
information
source
need
for
enforcement
action
present
its
own
dilemma
in
a
fledgling
but
competitive
somewhat
zero
sum
industry
this
type
of
enforcement
regime
create
incentive
for
market
operator
and
aggrieved
trader
to
bring
opportunistic
complaint
to
the
commission
in
pursuit
of
market
advantage
we
believe
that
these
dynamic
have
be
at
play
in
kalshi
repeat
decision
to
draw
the
regulatory
attention
to
the
practice
of
its
competitor
a
business
strategy
that
drag
the
entire
event
contract
space
into
a
political
quagmire
enforcement
action
and
correspond
litigation
in
the
event
contract
space
be
a
poor
use
of
the
commission
resource
while
the
commission
should
underscore
to
market
participant
their
responsibility
relate
to
self
regulation
it
should
also
set
realistic
expectation
with
congress
and
the
public
about
the
commission
limitation
in
the
enforcement
sphere
while
reliance
on
self
regulation
can
expose
the
public
to
risk
these
challenge
will
be
far
bad
if
the
commission
encourage
the
event
contract
space
to
migrate
offshore
or
to

to

outcome
of

the
more
likely
they
be

with

as
the

that

the

reach
new
height
of

the

although

these
include
at

7
bet
on

of
more
than
the
main
challenge
we
foresee
regard
the
enforceability
of
kalshi
position
limit
be
the
unlikely
scenario
that
individual
speculator
will
falsely
claim
to
have
a
demonstrate
establish
economic
hedging
need
so
that
they
can
wager
up
to
rather
than
be
limit
to
it
would
be
reasonable
of
the
commission
to
request
from
kalshi
great
clarity
on
the
precise
mean
and
method
it
intend
to
use
to
exercise
sole
discretion
in
determine
whether
a
member
have
demonstrate
a
sufficient
economic
hedging
need
the
number
of
individual
who
could
be
expect
to
wager
more
than
on
congressional
control
market
be
relatively
small
and
only
a
small
percentage
of
those
would
do
so
with
a
genuine
hedging
need
especially
as
it
work
on
build
liquidity
on
its
platform
kalshi
could
be
tempt
to
accept
alleged
hedger
with
minimal
scrutiny
more
transparency
on
kalshi
standard
would
also
set
a
precedent
for
future
market
participant
overall
however
we
see
minimal
concern
regard
enforceability
the
main
reason
be
that
kalshi
contract
create
strong
incentive
for
self
regulation
at
least
in
term
of
its
political
and
election
market
kalshi
have
one
overwhelming
comparative
advantage
vis
a
vis
its
competitor
the
regulatory
certainty
it
can
provide
trader
by
virtue
of
its
status
as
a
dcm
and
its
strategy
of
hew
closely
to
cftc
regulation
more
so
than
the
vast
majority
of
other
market
operator
in
the
political
bet
space
kalshi
in
our
assess
have
a
strong
motive
to
take
a
highly
conservative
risk
averse
approach
to
regulation
on
the
trader
side
the
small
number
of
individual
seek
to
wager
more
than
on
congressio
control
market
can
easily
place
bet
on
other
platform
with
far
less
scrutiny
of
their
motif
political
bettor
be
already
trade
political
contract
on
a
grow
number
of
offshore
platform
which
be
increa
keen
on
expand
election
line
as
vpns
and
other
technology
advance
and
the
reality
become
clear
that
the
government
have
a
minimal
capacity
and
political
will
to
pursue
enforcement
action
against
small
scale
retail
trader
this
activity
will
likely
continue
to
grow
do
the
requirement
that
these
contract
trade
in
multiple
of
5000
the
position
limit
applicable
to
the
contract
affect
the
analysis
of
the
hedge
utility
of
the
contract
we
believe
that
the
propose
change
to
the
contract
trading
requirement
bring
they
close
in
line
to
practice
in
future
market
which
increase
their
likelihood
of
serve
price
base
and
hedge
function
although
the
vast
majority
of
political
event
contract
be
use
for
speculation
we
have
see
case
of
retail
trader
use
these
market
for
hedge
we
be
aware
of
young
professional
for
example
who
use
kalshi
to
hedge
their
student
loan
our
concern
be
that
the
order
size
and
position
limit
will
deter
young
early
adopter
of
political
prediction
market
from
explore
their
hedging
use
case
with
small
amount
of
money
if
kalshi
be
propose
the
order
size
and
position
limit
at
the
request
of
the
commission
we
urge
the
cftc
to
grant
kalshi
more
leeway
what
be
the
price
form
information
for
these
contract
while
the
contract
be
trade
if
the
price
form
information
include
polling
and
other
election
prediction
information
be
that
information

that
be
generally
use
for

commodity

within

jurisdiction
the
question
of
which
party
will
control
congress
be
determine
by
so
many
factor
that
the
price
form
information
be
effectively
the
totality
of
the
american
and
global
political
discourse
the
vast
majority
of
price
form
information
in
these
market
can
not
be
regulate
by
the
government
polling
illustrate
why
price
form
information
in

market
be
nearly
impossible
to
regulate
polling
be
conduct
by
a
wide
array
of
source
with
vary
degree
of
reliability
and
motivation
even
if
the
government
be
to
find
way
to
regulate
fraudulent
poll
it
would
need
to
contend
with
the
reality
that
it
be
often
not
poll
themselves
but
rather
the
interpretation
analysis
and
dissemination
of
poll
that
drive
market
price
for
example
predictive

that
seek
to
turn

into

be
the
subject
of
trader
debate
due
to
the
way
they
weight
different
pollster
price
form
information
in

contract
tend
to
be
base
more
on
qualitative
data
point
than
the
informational

commodity

market
odd
of
a

be

not
only

also

on
the
ative
strength
of

contribute
to
narrative
that
drive

in
the

this
be
why
market

frequently
seem
to
be
incongruous
with
polling
and
other
datum
price
information
in
congressional
control
market
be
more
difficult
to
regulate
than
the
information

because
it

more

even
when
these

be
misleading
in
the
sense
that
they
be
intend
to
shape

and
push
agenda
they
typically
can
not

because
they
be
constitutionally
protect

should
and
if
so
how
would
the

list
the

take
step
to
address
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involve
the
price
form
information
for
the
contract
while
the
contract
be
trade
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
be
relatively
unusual
in
market
on
the
control
of
congress
it
be
more
common
in
small
scale
low
liquidity
market
where
there
be
less
public
relevant
information
more
volatility
high
degree
of
uncertainty
and
short
deadline
insofar
as
these
market
would
be
target
for
manipulation
at
all
we
believe
this
would
happen
primarily
through
the
dissemination
of
mislead
news
report
and
poll
give
how
quickly
market
participant
themselves
fact
check
these
source
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
register
entity
to
address
this
type
of
manipulation
more
effectively
than
the
market
the
only
scenario
we
can
think
of
where
manipulation
would
have
a
meaningful
distort
impact
on
price
form
information
for
the
contract
would
be
on
election
day
in
the
event
of
a
close
election
when
medium
reporting
be
unreliable
and
jittery
trader
be
buy
and
sell
in
a
state
of
panic
manipulator
could
cause
major
movement
in
the
market
the
easy
way
a
register
entity
could
address
possible
manipulation
be
by
refuse
to
host
discussion
board
on
their
platform
comment
section
have
historically
be
among
the
most
common
vehicle
for
market
manipulator
to
affect
price
on
predictit
the
amount
of
activity
in
these
comment
section
make
it
difficult
for
site
to
police
they
do
kalshi
limitation
on
market
participation
affect
the
susceptibility
of
the
contract
market
for
the
contract
to
manipulation
do
the
limitation
affect
the
extent
to
which
these
market
could
be
use
to
influence
perception
of
a
political
party
or
candidate
or
otherwise
be
implicate
in
an
attempt
election
manipulation
be
the
limitation
reasonably

in
rare
case
political
insider
buy
or
sell
position
in
prediction
market
to
manipulate
the
price
at
which
a
contract
be
trade
in
every
instance
we
have
see
this
happen
this
manipulation
be
motivate
by
a
desire
to
generate
optimism
in
the
broad
political
conversation
about
an
individual
underdog
candidate
electoral
prospect
market
that
be
target
for
these
effort
typically
have
limit
liquidity
which
make
market
manipulation
a
cost
effective
campaign
and
public
relation
strategy
we
be
highly
skeptical
that
anyone
would
have
sufficient
motivation
to
spend
the
amount
of
money
it
would
take
to
make
it
seem
as
if
the
republicans
or
democrats
have
a
marginally
high
chance
of
achieve
overall
control
of
the
house
or
senate
the
nine
category
of
individual
kalshi
would
exclude
be
broad
and
diverse
the
degree
to
which
limitation
on
their
participation
can
be
enforce
likely
varie
depend
on
their
profile
employment
and
compensation
structure
the
important
point
from
our
perspective
be
that
kalshi
be
endeavor
in
the
first
place
to
limit
market
participation
for
the
sake
of
advance
democratic
norm
in
the
vast
majority
of
other
political
bet
platform
market
participant
be
restrict
not
out
of
concern
for
election
integrity
but
because
they
be
win
account
that
generate
more
accurate
odd
at
the
expense
of
bookmaker
profit
kalshi
decision
to
exclude
a
broad
array
of
market
participant
speak
to
the
company
desire
to
work
with
regulator
to
assuage
concern
about
the
threat
election
contract
might
pose
to
democratic
institution
if
the
cftc
prevent
kalshi
from
offer
these
market
the
beneficiary
will
be
other
platform
with
few
qualm
about
enable
election
manipulation
should
the
commission
be
responsible
for
surveille
and
enforce
against
possible
manipulative
or
false
reporting
activity
involve
the
price
form
information
for
these
contract
while
the
contract
be
trade
as
with
the
register
entity
surveillance
and
enforcement
of
market
manipulation
by
the
cftc
would
generally
be
an
exercise
in
futility
these
attempt
would
serve
little
purpose
give
how
efficiently
kalshi
highly
liquid
congressional
control
market
would
self
correct
there
be
only
one
type
of
surveillance
or
enforcement
we
believe
the
commission
should
take
responsibility
for
trading
in
these
market
by
cftc
staff
a
strict
policy
prohibit
cftc
staff
from
trade
in
these
mar
might
help
to
bolster
the
agency
credibility
as
a
regulator
it
would
assuage
doubt
that
commission
staff
have
a
motive
to
engage
in
manipulation
false
reporting
activity
in
these
contract
could
trade
in
the
market
for
the
contract
obligate
the
commission
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
if
so
be
this
an
appropriate
role
for
the
commission
ever
since
chairman
behnam
raise
the
possibility
of
the
cftc
turn
into
an
election
cop
in
his
inter
on
the
odd
lot
podcast
we
have
interview
numerous
election
and
compliance
official
to
explore
this
issue
we
be
not
aware
of
anyone
in
congress
or
the
policymake
community
who
believe
that
the
cftc
have
authority
to
be
an
election
cop
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
indeed
this
concern
be
so
speculative
that
it
provoke
suspicion
about
whether
it
be
merely
a
pretense
for
the
cftc
to
avoid
decision
on
political
event
contract
it
be
important
to
consider
that
the
cftc
have
have
oversight
over
several
political
prediction
market
that
offer
contract
for
the
2000
2020
and
2022
election
in
each
of
these
year
election
dispute
be
litigate
across
state
and
federal
electoral
apparatus
and
court
notwithstanding
the
deep
widespread
and
in
some
case
violent
public
reaction
that
these
dispute
engender
they
do
not
require
any
meaningful
cftc
intervention
in
bet
market
nor
do
they
even
generate
any
significant
legislative
or
public
demand
for
cftc
involvement
the
easy
way
to
prevent
the
commission
from
become
involve
in
the
electoral
process
be
to
establish
clear
settlement
rule
for
the
contract
we
believe
that
kalshi
and
other
political
bet
operator
need
to
prepare
for
the
possibility
that
election
dispute
could
leave
unresolved
the
question
of
which
party
control
congress
well
after
election
day
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
encourage
kalshi
to
develop
and
publicize
contingency
plan
for
this
scenario
clarity
among
trader
and
the
public
on
precisely
when
and
under
what
circumstance
the
contract
will
pay
out
would
prevent
the
type
of
outcome
that
could
invite
cftc
involvement
what
other
factor
should
the
commission
consider
in
determine
whether
these
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
perhaps
because
political
event
contract
be
so
tightly
regulate
in
the
united
states
debate
on
this
issue
be

the

from

likely

to
the

of

who
be

they

exchange
with

close

with

in

in

with

yet
representative
of
the

rarely
attend
these

base
on
our
conversation
with
executive
and

in

our
impression
be
that
they
be
too
quick
to
assume
that
cftc
official
be
not
engage
transparently
and
in
good
faith
in
their
public

and
that
engagement
in
these
forum
be
pointless
in
light
of
the
inside
track
they
believe
they
have
at
the
same
time
the
company
have
fail
to
invest
sufficiently
in
their
advocate
in
the

community
they
have
provide
relatively

even

the

simply
to

also
note
that
the

be
effectively
a
substitute
from

would

ibid
in
mersinger
view
the
unmistakable
take
away
for
dcms
in
the
absence
of

process
be
not
to
expend
resource

because
the
commission
may
randomly

they
to

without
provide

definition
and
standard

will
apply
in

congress
congress
could
pass
legislation
clarify
its
position
on
prediction
market
the
most
likely
opportunity
for
congress
to
act
will
be
in
2023
as
part
of
its
deliberation
on
digital
asset
regulation
a
more
permanent
though
highly
improbable
legislative
solution
would
involve
repeal
of
pertinent
aspect
of
the
federal
wire
act
unlawful
internet
gaming
enforcement
act
dodd
frank
act
and
commodity
exchange
act
particularly
in
light
of
the
ftx
fallout
we
see
little
incentive
for
member
of
congress
to
complicate
legislation
on
digital
asset
regulation
and
other
press
issue
for
the
sake
of
a
contentious
debate
over
political
bet
market
these
market
generate
a
relatively
miniscule
amount
of
economic
activity
campaign
contribution
and
lobbying
pressure
when
compare
to
other
industry
kalshi
appear
not
to
be
make
a
strong
lobbying
push
in
this
respect
as
it
be
previously
consider
and
the
grassroots
activism
that
currently
exist
on
behalf
of
prediction
market
be
likely
insufficient
to
overcome
inertia
in
congress
insofar
as
there
be
appetite
on
capitol
hill
to
act
on
this
issue
in
the
new
congress
we
believe
that
the
initiative
would
need
to
come
from
the

and
senate
agriculture

as
well
as
from
massachusetts

appear
to
have
overcome
some
doubt
among

about
the
wisdom
of

the
possibility
however
that

will

be
among
the
factor
that
create
political
risk
around
any
