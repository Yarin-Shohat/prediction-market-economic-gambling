those

the

go
back
to
the

congressional

control
contract
allow

to
hedge

aggregate
and

that
flow
from

against

congressional
control

offer
the
public
significant
value
in
at

two
respect
first
they
allow

to
hedge
against
the
aggregate

that
come
with

of

who

the

second

both

congressional

of

control

allow
party
to
hedge
aggregate
risk
when
congressional
power
shift
from
one
party
to
the
other
the
financial
risk
face
business
and
individual
shift
too
but
each
specific
risk
may
not
always
be
knowable
beforehand
as
describe
above
change
in
congressional
control
can
create
aggregate
risk
in
a
myriad
of
way
include
through
legislation
nomination
taxation
and
more
that
be
true
even
when
the
change
in
control
do
not
materially
increase
the
risk
of
any
particular
legislative
outcome
take
for
example
a
venture
capital
firm
that
invest
in
multiple
different
type
of
industry
that
firm
may
be
able
to
mitigate
risk
through
multiple
independent
hedgesfor
example
one
regard
the
epa
car
emission
standard
and
another
about
the
sec
regulation
of
crypto
but
there
be
no
reason
to
prohibit
that
firm
from
the
one
stopshoppe
that
a
congressional
control
contract
offer
such
contract
give
financial
force
to
the
truism
that
one
congress
or
chamber
that
seek
to
aggressively
regulate
a
particular
industry
can
use
its
broad
power
to
undermine
that
industry
in
several
way
so
too
for
a
congress
that
support
a
give
industry
because
that
support
may
evaporate
if
congressional
control
change
hand
try
to
manage
these
financial
risk
by
anticipate
how
congress
will
exercise
its
specific
power
be
like
try

buy
homeowner

base
on
where
a
fire
could
start
there
be
too
many
basis
to
cover
just
like
a
fire
might
start
in
a
kitchen
electrical
closet
or
even
outside
so
too
congress
might
take
adverse
action
through
legislation
confirmation
taxation
and
more
control
contract
allow
business
to
hedge
all
that
risk
use
a
single
instrument
just
like
a
homeowner
buy
a

policy
as

congressional

advantage
of

become
more
or
