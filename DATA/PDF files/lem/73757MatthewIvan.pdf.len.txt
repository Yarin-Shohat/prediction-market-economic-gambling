the

the

believe
that

to
far
specify
type
of

contract
that
may
not
be

or
accept
for

would
also
benefit
the
commission
and
its

by
reduce
the
need
to
undertake
individualized
resource
intensive

review
as
far
discuss
below
under
the

may
initiate
a
90
day
review
to
evaluate
whether
a

be
of
a
type
that

the

should
provide

with
a
well
understanding

parameter
and
should
in
turn
reduce
the
likelihood
that

raise

concern

this
will
be

finally
the

an

the

they
nevertheless
involve

the

direct

consequence
for

the

find
that
since
the
economic
effect
of

be
diffuse
and
unpredictable
the
price
of
the

so
the

the

that

embed
in
the

similarly
in

the

find
that
the
unpredictability
of

economic
consequence
of

mean
that
the

can
not
reasonably
be
expect
to

the

find
that
there

no

the

the

concern
a

also
would

just
as

in
the

would
for
example
permit

even
when
such
vote
may
be
contrary
to
a

or
organized
group
of

political
view
it
would
also
raise
concern
that
conduct
design
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
could
be
use
to
manipulate
the

in

or
conversely
that

electoral
perception
for
example
false

other
misinformation
such
as

far
argue
that

the

that

and

the
opaque

for

may
increase
the
risk
of

relate
to
the

and
pricing
of
the
contract
while
decrease
the
ability
of
the
list
register
entity
and
the
commission
to
detect
such
activity
the
commission
note
far
that
it
be
not
tasked
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of

finance
law
however
if

be

in
event
contract
that
involve
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
a
political

then
the
commission
could
find
itself
investigate
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
while
certain
commodity
outside
the
commission
direct
remit
do
underlie
derivative
without
give
rise
to
significant
problem
due
to
the
special
role
of

in
our
society
the
commission
believe
that
the
oversight
function
in
this
area
be
well
reserve
for
other
expert
body
of
course
governmental
body
be
task
with
that
function
but
the
commission
have
both
the
authority
and
responsibility
to
address
fraud
false
reporting
and
manipulation
in

as

on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
or
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
the
commission
would
have
a
statutory
responsibility
to
exercise
its
surveillance
investigation
and
enforcement
authority
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
market
in
such
contract
conversely
attempt
at
manipulation
of
such
market
could
have
broad
electoral
implication
similarly
draw
the

into
investigation
of

indeed

such
scenario
underscore
for
the
commission
that
it
have
no
appropriate
role
in
this
area
again
the
commission
do
not
have
the
specialized
experience
appropriate
for
this
role
and
believe
that
it
be
unlikely
that
congress
intend
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its

or
expend
its

this
way
the
unique
additional

that
would

by

request
for
comment
the
commission
request
comment
on
all
aspect
of
its
propose
technical
amendment
to
implementation
timeline
the
commission
propose
that
the
final
rule
amendment
be
effective
30
day
after
publication
in
the
federal
register
the
commission
believe
that
this
30
day
period
should
provide
register
entity
with
sufficient
time
to
account
for
the
rule
amendment
in
their
product
design
and
compliance
procedure
however
the
commission
also
propose
an
implementation
period
that
would
run
for
an
additional
30
day
after
the
effective
date
of
the
final
rule
amendment
for
a
total
of
60
day
from
the
date
of
publication
of

amendment
in

solely
for
event
contract
that

list
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
the
final
rule
amendment
and
that
be
impact
by
the
amendment
the
commission
believe
that
a
60
day
implementation
period
for
these
contract
will
minimize
any
market
disruption
that
might
be
cause
by
the
rule
amendment
in
this
regard
the
commission
note
that
event
contract
be
generally
base
upon
a
discrete
occurrence
or
event
and
commission
staff
anecdotal
experience
indicate
that
many
event
contract
settle
within
relatively
short
time
horizon
this
couple
with
the
fact
that
as
discuss
far
in
section
infra
contract
that
involve
gaming
as
propose
to
be
define
currently
comprise
a
small
portion
of
the
overall

market
suggest
that
few

down

extent
that
a
particular
event
contract
that
be
impact
by
the
rule
amendment
have
a
settlement
date
that
extend
beyond
the
implementation
period
the
commission
believe
that
60

would
provide
sufficient
time
for
the
register
entity
to
ensure
the
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
the
contract
for
the
avoidance
of

the

as

the

the

subsequently
determine

the
specific
type
or
quantity
of
event
contract
that
may
be
list
for
trade
in
the
future
the
observed
event
contract
trend
cause
the
commission
to
anticipate
that
go
forward
absent

propose
rule
amendment
the

increase
accordingly
by
well
delineate
the
type
of

should
enhance
register

confidence
with
respect
to
product
design
and
compliance
potentially
yield
and
resource
save
benefit
for
they
in
the

may
help
guard
against
market
disruption
that
might
otherwise
be
cause
if
an

trading
and
the

later
determine
follow
an
individualized
review
pursuant
to
that
the

the

note
that

be
generally
base
upon
a
discrete

and
commission
staff
anecdotal
experience
indicate
that
many

settle
within
relatively
short

this
couple
with
the
fact
that
as

that

as
propose

currently
comprise
a
small

that

by

if

generally
establish
that

settle
either
on

that
be
expect
to

in

typically
the
end
of

calendar
year
base
on
cftc
staff
experience
in
connection
with
administer
the

the
commission
believe
notwithstanding

expiration
date
most
event

settle
close
in

to

with

to
the
limited
number
of

that
the
commission
anticipate
would
have
settlement
date
beyond
the
propose
60
day
implementation
period
the
commission
expect
that
the
cost
to
exchange
associate
with
orderly
wind
down
would
include
operational
compliance
and
technological
cost
as
far
note
below
the
cost
to
exchange
associate
with
the
wind
down
of
these
contract
may
also
include
the
inability
to
realize
the
full
anticipated
return
on
investment
in
the
contract
the
commission
note
that
the
precise
cost
attributable
to
contract
wind
down
would
be
proprietary
information
of
the

exchange
to
which
the
commission
do
not
have

however
give
the
limited
number
of
contract
that
the

anticipate
would
need
to
be
wind
down
before
their
exist
settlement
date
the
commission
believe
that
these
cost
to
the
exchange
should
be
relatively
modest
the
commission
far
anticipate
that
certain
market
participant
may
incur
loss
depend
on
the
nature
of
their
position
in
the
contract
at
and
lead
up
to
wind
down
conversely
certain
market
participant
may
profit
base
on
the
nature
of
their

at
and
lead
up
to
wind
down
the
commission
note
that
the
type
of

that

by
this
propose

if

tend
to
be
fully
collateralize
which
would

a
bearing
on

risk
to
which
market
participant
would
be
expose
in
the
event
of
the
early
wind
down
of
such
a

the
commission
note
that
the
future
market
loss
or
gain
to
a
market
participant
be
not
predictable
with
any
datum
and
therefore
the
commission
believe
that
it
be
not
feasible
to
far
quantify
these
cost
associate
with
potential
contract
wind
down
the

recognize
that
a

for

of

the

this

amendment
to

view
this

the

base

the

may
have
more
of

for

suggest
that
the
overall

to

of

would
be
relatively
modest
for

the
commission
estimate
that

comprise
approximately
1

of

the

estimate

the

believe
that

the

the
