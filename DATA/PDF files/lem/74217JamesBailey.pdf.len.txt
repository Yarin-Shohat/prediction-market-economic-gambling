dear
cftc
commissioner
I
be
write
to
express
my
support
for
prediction
market
and
event
contract
particularly
in
light
of
recent
development
and
ongoing
research
I
would
like
to
expand
on
the
follow
point
1
academic
support
for
prediction
market
the
academic
literature
continue
to
provide
strong
support
for
the
value
and
utility
of
prediction
market
a
2023
study
publish
in
the
american
journal
of
economic
and
sociology
highlight
how
these
market
serve
as
valuable
tool
for
aggregate
diverse
information
and
predict
future
event
with
a
high
degree
of
accuracy
this
be
one
more
entry
in
a
long
line
of
supportive
work
such
as
the
2008
science
paper
the
promise
of
prediction
market
which
include
5
nobel
laureate
among
its
coauthor
2
enhance
price
discovery
and
risk
reduction
event
contract
facilitate
price
discovery
by
highlight
potential
future
scenario
and
their
probability
this
awareness
help
stakeholder
well
understand
and
prepare
for
tail
risk
thereby
reduce
uncertainty
and
potential
negative
impact
on
the
broad
economy
for
instance
political
event
contract
have
be
instrumental
in
highlight
significant
possibility
such
as
the
potential
for
an
incumbent
president
to
withdraw
from
a
race
this
early
warning
system
allow
business
and
individual
to
anticipate
and
strategize
for
various
political
outcome
3
improve
political
information
the
core
benefit
of
price
discovery
in
prediction
market
be
that
it
provide
onlooker
not
just
participant
with
more
accurate
information
about
the
world
where
it
have
be
allow
this
include
more
accurate
information
about
political
outcome
this
information
can
allow
political
participant
such
as
party
and
voter
to
see
which
candidate
be
more
likely
to
succeed
and
where
they
should
target
their
resource
arguably
market
be
one
reason
that
a
major
party
be
just
able
to
realize
they
be
head
for
defeat
and
correct
course
find
a
new
candidate
that
market
realize
would
be
more
appealing
to
voter
even
though
poll
at
the
time
do
not
indicate
this
and
the
replacement
poll
number
only
shoot
up
once
they
be
no
long
merely
a
hypothetical
option
4
we
already
have
election
cop
I
outline
above
some
benefit
of
election
event
contract
that
the
commissioner
may
not
have
consider
but
chair
benham
have
argue
that
these
contract
would
come
with
the
cost
of
turn
the
cftc
into
election
cop
while
the
cftc
might
choose
to
try
to
expand
its
power
by
bring
case
in
that
direction
this
would
in
no
way
be
necessary
since
the
united
states
already
have
election
cop
at
the
state
and
federal
level
and
electoral
fraud
be
already
illegal
if
the
concern
be
that
market
could
increase
the
incentive
for
electoral
fraud
the
commission
should
consider
whether
there
be
way
to
limit
these
incentive
without
entirely
ban
political
event
contract
and
lose
the
informational
benefit
thereof
for
instance
by
limit
the
size
of
event
contract
as
they
have
in
the
predictit
no
action
letter
