we
be
write
to
support
the
legalization
of
election
prediction
market
in
the
united
states
as
business
owner
we
be
well
aware
of
the
impact
of
government
change
on
the
bottom
line
of
american
business
change
in
tax
law
for
instance
do
not
simply
affect
the
amount
one
have
to
pay
today
they
may
affect
the
viability
of
a
vast
number
of
investment
that
a
business
may
make
as
well
in
addition
change
in
immigration
law
may
harm
the
ability
of
a
tech
startup
to
attract
the
good
talent
from
around
the
world
if
those
change
limit
the
accessibility
of

other
visa
category
game
change
engineer
can
be
anywhere
in
the
world
and
any
constraint
on
a
startup
ability
to
find
and
hire
they
could
cause
a
major
financial
loss
as
a
result
great
restriction
on
immigration
would
harm
deel
and
many
other
company
in
particular
since
deel
be
a
company
that
help
firm
hire
the
good
candidate
from
all
around
the
world
we
be
particularly
impact
by
change
in
immigration
law
these
two
example
be
far
from
exhaustive
but
constitute
two
representative
substantiation
of
the
broad
principle
that
the
economic
consequence
of
federal
policy
can
be
very
real
perhaps
the
big
channel
by
which
federal
policy
transmit
to
small
business
be
change
in
the
overall
business
environment
federal
policy
regard
automatic
stabilizer
fiscal
stimulus
the
federal
debt
and
public
infrastructure
can
affect
the
level
of
growth
in
the
economy
the
national
interest
rate
and
the
overall
level
of
price
growth
those
variable
in
turn
can
have
enormous
impact
on
a
company
like
deel
which
provide
expense
management
and
payroll
service
to
many
fast
grow
startup
if
the
number
of
startup
shrink
due
to
a
hostile
business
environment
then
that
would
harm
our
bottom
line
over
the
last
year
we
have
see
numerous
policy
priority
from
member
of
congress
on
both
side
of
the
aisle
that
make
those
difference
stark
to
even
a
casual
observer
these
represent
risk
to
our
balance
sheet
and
to
million
of
other
a
product
that
would
help
we
reduce
our
exposure
to
political
change
would
thus
help
manage
our
risk
and
allow
we
to
focus
on
deliver
the
good
product
we
can
to
our
customer
