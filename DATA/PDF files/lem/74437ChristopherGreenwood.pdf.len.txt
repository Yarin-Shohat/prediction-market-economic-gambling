the

congressional

would

owner
and

official
among
other
explain
all
of
this
8
the
cftc
block
kalshi
contract
anyway
it
reason
that
the
statute
empower
it
to
ban
event
contract
whenever
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
would
amount
to
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
not
merely
when
the
event
underlie
the
contract
involve
such
an
activity
trading
on
a
contract
that
depend
on
the
result
of
an
election
the
commission
continue
amount
to
gaming
and
may
also
violate
some
state
gambling
law
because
it
stake
money
on
a
contingent
event
having
find
the
congressional
control
contract
subject
to
public
interest
scrutiny
the
cftc
conclude
that
the
contract
fail
it
because
they
supposedly
would
further
no
economic
purpose
while
threaten
election
integrity
9
the
order
analysis
fail
at
every
step
it
contort
and
misapplie
the
cea
text
ignore
its
structure
and
purpose
allow
a
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
and
engage
in
faulty
and
unsupported
reasoning
10
to
start
the
commission
amount
to
test
bungle
the
statute
text
trade
an
event
contract
can
never
amount
to
terrorism
assassination
or
warfare
accordingly
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
the
provision
as
a
whole
be
to
read
the
cea
reference
to
contract
that
involve
those
activity
as
focus
on
the
contract
underlie
event
for
example
the
commission
may
prohibit
a
contract
contingent
on
whether
the
president
will
be
assassinate
because
the
contract
underlie
event
involve
an
assassination
and
the
cftc
may
reasonably
determine
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
a
contract
to
pay
out
if
the
president
be
assassinate
on
that
common
sense
read
the
congressional
control
contract
be
not
subject
to
public
interest
review
because
partisan
control
of
a
congressional
chamber
involve
neither
gaming
nor
unlawful
activity
11
on
its
flawed
reading
of
involve
however
the
commission
find
that
buy
a
congressional
control
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
gambling
prohibit
by
state
law
because
purchaser
would
stake
money
on
a
contingent
event
which
some
state
define
as
gambling
but
buy
one
of
these
contract
be
nothing
like
bet
on
a
game
of
chance
or
even
the
super
bowl
election
be
not
a
game
they
have
real
economic
consequence
nor
do
congress
implicitly
empower
50
state
legislature
to
ban
event
contract
through
the
backdoor
just
the
opposite
congress
give
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
preempt
contrary
state
law
12
the
commission
interpretation
of
involve
gaming
and
unlawful
cause
the
cea
narrow
exception
to
swallow
its
general
rule
if
the
cftc
may
ban
any
event
contract
so
long
as
buy
or
sell
that
contract
would
amount
to
illegal
gaming
and
if
illegal
gaming
include
stake
money
on
any
contingency
the
cftc
could
prohibit
any
event
contract
base
solely
on
its
view
of
the
public
interest
have
congress
intend
to
confer
such
sweeping
authority
on
the
cftc
it
would
have
say
so
instead
it
authorize
the
commission
to
undertake
public
interest
review
of
event
contract
only
if
they
fall
into
one
of
the
enumerate
category
13
the
cftc
public
interest
analysis
which
it
have
no
authority
to
conduct
in
the
first
place
be
just
as
flawed
as
its
statutory
construction
apply
an
invent
economic

test
the

banker
and
real

owner
all
of
whom

associate
with
the

the

instead
improvise
heighten
requirement
that
fundamentally
misunderstand
how

hedge
work
and
then
ignore
the
evidence
that
kalshi
propose

meet
even
those
requirement
it
likewise
ignore
the
establish

basing
function
of
these

and
it
follow
up
with
unfounded
and
implausible
speculation
about
election
integrity
as
if
business
and
individual
do
not
already
have
significant
economic
exposure
to

outcome
much
of
the
cftc

reasoning
would
equally
condemn

once
again
that
approach
be
fundamentally
irreconcilable
with

they

that
specify

with
different
potential
outcome
a
payment
structure
for
those
outcome
and
a
date
when
the

these
contract
typically
center
on
a
yes

question
whether
the

will
cut

an

can

the

of

on

as
a
result
the
market
price
of

reflect
real

probabilistic
belief
about
whether
the

will
occur
for
example
if
a
yes
contract
on
a
government
shutdown
occurrence
be
trade
for
and
thus
the
corresponding
no
position
be
trade
for
that
mean
the
market
currently
believe
there
be
a
60
chance
the
shutdown
will
occur
and
a
40
chance
that
it
will
not
24
event
contract
give
trader
direct
exposure
to
the
outcome
of
real
world
event
with
economic
ramification
no
other
instrument
perfectly
capture
the
risk
inherent
in
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
an
event
for
example
a
trader
can
use
a
future
contract
on
the
500
stock
index
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
economy
will
grow
generally
but
that
contract
would
be
a
very
imprecise
way
of
address
whether
the
next
gdp
report
will
identify
economic
growth
above
a
certain
level
only
an
event
contract
on
the
next
gdp
announcement
would
do
that
25
like
other
form
of
derivative
event
contract
thus
allow
business
and
individual
to
hedge
against
risk
for
example
a
beachfront
property
owner
in
a
city
might
buy
contract
predict
that
a
hurricane
will
hit
that
city
because
the
payout
could
offset
economic
loss
the
owner
be
more
likely
to
incur
if
a
hurricane
hit
or
a
firm
in
a
regulated
industry
might
buy
contract
predict
that
a
very
aggressive
nominee
will
be
confirm
as
its
lead
regulator
to
help
mitigate
the
risk
associate
with
that
official
adverse
regulatory
agenda
26
event
contract
be
distinct
from
insurance
the
property
owner
in
the
example
above
could
buy
insurance
to
cover
actual
property
loss
include
from
a
hurricane
an
event
contract
would
instead
hedge
the
diffuse
risk
of
loss
associate
with
a
hurricane
include
property
damage
a
decline
in
airbnb
revenue
and
high
cost
of
food
and
water
meanwhile
the
regulated
firm
might
be
able
to
buy
insurance
for
the
cost
of
legal
defense
but
an
event
contract
would
directly
hedge
the
manifold
risk
associate
with
a
hostile
regulator
27
beyond
economic
benefit
to
trader
event
contract
also
generate
informational
value
for
the
public
as
their
price
can
be
understand
as
a
collective
prediction
by
the
market
the
expectation
and
willingness
of
trader
to
put
their
money
on
the
line
form
the
price
which
reflect
the
market
view
of
the
odd
that
an
event
will
occur
prediction
market
therefore
serve
as
high
powered
and
highly
effective
information
aggregation
tool
generate
crucial
insight
for
researcher
business
individual
and
government
and
the
result
datum
about
the
market
perception
of
the

likelihood
can
be
use
in
turn
to
determine
price
for
asset
whose
value
depend
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
the
underlie

political

allow
for
hedging
of

and

28
politic

less
than
agriculture

be
beset
with

and
give
the
many
way
in
which
government
influence
the

political

can
have
just
as
profound
an
effect
on
a
firm
bottom
line
as
spike
in

price
or
interest
rate
business
and
individual
thus
have
good
reason
to
use
derivative
to
hedge
political
risk
just
as
they
hedge
other
risk
and
no
financial
instrument
be
well
suit
to
hedge
risk
associate
with
political
event
than
contract
that
reference
the

themselves
29
indeed
kalshi
have
offer
event

base
on
whether
certain

would
be

whether
certain

would
be

and
whether
the
federal

would
shut
down
all
of

that
carry
obvious
economic
repercussion
for
a
wide
range
of
business
and

30
like

but
the
commission
authority
in

it
may
determine
that
an

be

to

only
if
the

one
of

enumerate

war

the
commission
can
not
undertake
any
public

review
unless
the
contract
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
43
the
process
for
review
event
contract
therefore
proceed
in
two
basic
step
first
the
commission
determine
whether
the
contract
involve
one
of
the
six
enumerate
if
not
the
contract
may
be
listedperiod
second
if
the
contract
do
involve
a
list
activity
the
cftc
may
determine
that
it
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
bar
its
listing
44
for
example
a
contract
that
entitle
the
buyer
to
payment
if
a
terrorist
group
carry
out
an
attack
on
soil
would
involve
terrorism
a
contract
contingent
on
whether
the
president
will
be
assassinate
would
involve
assassination
and
one
contingent
on
the
progress
of
russian
force
against
a
ukrainian
target
would
involve
war
the
cftc
would
be
empower
to
review
those
contract
to
determine
whether
they
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
to
block
they
if
it
conclude
that
they
be
although
those
example
may
sound
far
fetched
foreign
website
be
currently
offer
contract
on
among
other
thing
will
a
nuclear
bomb
explode
in
ukraine
in

congress
thus
have
good
reason
to
provide
the
cftc
with
a
means
to
block
these
dangerous
contract
45
the
cftc
have
promulgate
an
implement
regulation
it
provide
that
a
market
shall
not
list
for
trade
any
event
contract
that
involve
relate
to
or
reference
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
or
an
activity
that
be
similar
to
an
enumerate
activity
that
the
commission
determine
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
17
46
the
commission
have
not
exercise
its
authority
to
determine
by
rule
or
regulation
that
a
contract
involve
any
activity
similar
to
the
five
enumerate
one
be
contrary
to
the
public

7
as
a
result
the
commission
may
subject
a
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
only
if
it
involve
illegal
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
47
the
cea
do
not
authorize

scrutiny
of

congress
could

the

find

see

but
of

the

do

could
not
find
that
election
or
the
selection
of
a

or
president
pro

themselves
involve

or
unlawful

rather
the
commission
reason
that
an

those
activity
if
trade
in
the
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
illegal
activity
see
order
at

the
commission
then
declare
that
buy

sell
kalshi
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
and
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
law
to
reach
that
conclusion
the
commission
rely
on
dictionary
definition
and
state
statute
that
broadly
define
illegal
gambling
to
include
stake
money
on
the
outcome
of
any
game
contest
or

event
at

61
finally
having
find
that
the
congressional
control
contract
be
subject
to
public

review
the
commission
determine
that
those
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
13
23
62
every
step
of
the
order
analysis
be
fatally
flawed
63
first
the
heart
of
the
commission
reasoning
be
its
implausibly
broad
and
shift
interpretation
of
involve
the
commission
conclude
that
a
contract
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
if
trade
in
the
contract
amount
to
the
enumerate
activity
at
7
emphasis
add
in
other
word
an
event
contract
need
not
be
contingent
on
the
occurrence
of
an
event
that
involve
crime
a
terrorist
attack
an
assassination
an
act
of
war
or
gaming
instead
a
contract
be
subject
to
public
interest
review
and
potential
rejection
if
engage
in
the
transaction
would
amount
to
one
of
those
activity
64
that
interpretation
of
involve
fundamentally
misunderstand
the
statutory
structure
the
activity
enumerate
in
describe
event
that
underlie
a
contract
if
the
event
underlie
a
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
the
cftc
may
block
it
the
enumerate
activity
do
not
describe
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
itself
65
that
be
most
apparent
from
the
fact
that
trade
on
an
event
contract
could
never
constitute
an
act
of
terrorism
war
or
assassination
for
those
activity
the
focus
must
be
on
the
contract
underlie
event
to
justify
rejection
of
kalshi
contract
the
commission
therefore
have
to
embrace
a
radically
different
meaning
of
the
word
involve
with
respect
to
two
and
only
two
of
the
statute
six
enumerate
activity
game
and
unlawful
act
for
those
activity
alone
the
theory
go
congress
refer
to
the
act
of
contract
rather
than
to
the
contract
underlie
event
that
torture
approach
under
which
the
same
operative
text
toggle
back
and
forth
between
two
inconsistent
meaning
over
five
subparagraph
be
a
sure
sign
that
the
order
misconstrue
the
cea
66
second
turn
to
the
enumerate
activity
the
commission
again
adopt
definition
that
statutory
context
foreclose
the
commission
reason
that
gaming
mean
gambling
and
that
gambling
encompass
any
wager
on
a
game
contest
or
contingent
event
at
8
because
those
who
trade
on
kalshi
contract
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
the
commission
continue
that
act
of
trading
amount
to
gambling
and
thus
game
at
10
67
but
especially
in
this
context
gaming
do
not
and
can
not
sweep
that
broadly
rather
it
refer
to
bet
on
game
and
especially
to
bet
on
game
of
chance
an
election
be
not
a
game
at
all
let
alone
the
equivalent
of
bingo
or
roulette
it
be
the
foundational
exercise
of
democratic
governance
unlike
game
election
have
independent
and
meaningful
political
and
economic
consequence
68
as
a
group
of
distinguished
economic
scholar
include
a
nobel
laureate
tell
the
cftc
in
a
comment
letter
an
election
prediction
market
be
no
more
gaming
than
traditional
financial
market
include
commodity
future
and
derivative
market
due
to
the
vast
economic
utility
of
the
contract
69
the
commission
contrary
interpretation
fundamentally
upend
the
cea
entire
approach
after
all
every
event
contract
by
definition
stake
money
on
a
contingent
event
as
a
result
under
the
commission
reading
of
involve
and
game
no
event
contract
would
escape
public
interest
scrutiny
that
would
render
the
remain
enumerate
activity
entirely
superfluous
and
it
would
cause
this
one
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
flip
the
statute
default
by
authorize
cftc
public
interest
review
of
every
event
contract
70
similarly
the
commission
reason
that
trading
in
kalshi
contract
would
be
unlawful
under
state
law
because
gamble
on
election
be
illegal
in
some
state
at
11
12
the
commission
unlawful
activity
analysis
all
two
sentence
of
it
fare
no
well
than
its
approach
to
gaming
71
once
again
the
commission
jeopardize
the
entire
statutory
structure
this
time
by
give
state
veto
power
over
the
federal
regime
the
cea
preempt
state
law
in
this
area
in
favor
of
exclusive
cftc
jurisdiction
7
but
the
order
reasoning
empower
state
to
trump
federal
law
and
effectively
ban
trading
in
event
contract
merely
by
broadly
defining
gambling
indeed
some
state
law
already
forbid
stake
money
on
any
contingent
event
see
order
at
8
so
in
this
respect
too
the
agency
interpretation
take
seriously
would
shut
down
the
entire
national
market
in
event
contract
that
be
patently
not
what
congress
intend
by
confer
on
the
cftc
target
authority
to
prohibit
contract
involve
war
assassination
and
the
other
tailor
category
72
in
her
dissent
commissioner
mersinger
point
out
yet
another
flaw
in
the
commission
analysis
it
presume
that
kalshi
contract
be
premise
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
at
10
but
kalshi
contract
do
not
turn
solely
on
the
result
of
any
one
election
they
turn
on
the
aggregate
result
of
all
relevant
election
in
that
year
cycle
plus
the
chamber
previous
composition
plus
internal
party
machination
as
recent
event
illustrate
internal
faction
can
prevent
even
a
majority
party
from
elect
a
speaker
at
most
congressional
control
be
highly
correlate
with
the
outcome
of
many
election
but
that
be
equally
true
of
many
event
contract
that
the
cftc
have
never
deride
as
game
73
finally
having
decide
that
kalshi
contract
involve
both
gaming
and
illegal
activity
the
commission
deem
they
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
too
the
order
analysis
fail
the
standard
for
reasoned
decision
make
74
the
commission
begin
with
an
economic
purpose

the

that

flawed
on

for
one
certain
effect
of

be
not
diffuse
think
of
a
consult
firm
with
deep
tie
to
one
party
congressional
control
by
the
other
party
would
directly
harm
its
business
the
congressional
control
contract
would
allow
it
to
hedge
against
that
risk
and
it
would
allow
other
to
more
accurately
determine
the

where
a

demonstrate
76
for

it
be
simply
wrong
to
say
that

do
not
justify

permit

the
purpose
of

be
to

not
like
insurance
to
offset
precise
loss
that
be
why
award
win
economist
submit
comment
explain
the

of

it
be
why
a
manage
director
at
a
lead
investment
bank
comment
that
he
regularly
assist
client
with
hedge
election
risk
and
it
be
why
a
host
of
commenter
from
a
wide
range
of
industry
from
cannabis
to
green
energy
affirmatively
state
they
would
use
kalshi
contract
to
hedge
risk
for
all
of
the
same
reason
the

ability
to
aggregate

about
the

of

result
would
allow
that

to
play
a

in

that

oil

the

reject
all
this
evidence
without

rest
on
its
own

so
in
the
face
of
concrete
contrary
proof
77
for

it

78
in
short
even
if
economic
purpose
be
a
legally
appropriate
inquiry
it
be
irrational
for
the
commission
to
subject
election
event
contract
to
a
uniquely
high
showing
of

the

that

why
because
someone

he
despise
in
a

bid
to
swing

of
a

on

that

the

of

behavior
despite
the
prevalence
of

market
both
in

it

why

then

that
purchase
to

the

if

they

82
venture

the

the

yet
the

do
not

that

the

of

which
the

rely

to

likewise
it
be
the
role
of
the
federal

commission
and

to

the

of

they
already
take

it
misconstrue
to

anytime

but
the
only
reading
of
the

that
make

be
that
an

terrorism

89
the

compound
its

by
distort
the

it
convert

into

second
the

construe
the

category
in
a
way
that
empower

of

even
though
the

insofar
as
they

90
the
commission
misreading
of

nowhere

enable
the

reject
a

the

here
too
the

the

kalshi
to

the
