forecastex
be
supportive
of
the
commission
goal
to
increase
the
transparency
surround
the
listing
of

by
create
rule
that
clearly
define
what
type
of
contract
be
prohibit
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
such
rule
be
long
overdue
and
can
help
registered
entity
by
provide
clear
standard
that
can
guide
their
decision
make
process
however
as
propose
the
cftc
revision
to
do
not
accomplish
this
goal
but
instead
make
the
regulatory
environment
more
opaque
for
register
entity
the
commission
proposal
appear
to
be
focus
on
achieve
two
thing
prohibit
election
relate
contract
and
reduce
the
amount
of
resource
that
the
cftc
devote
to
review
in
their
effort
to
prohibit
contract
relate
to
election
the
commission
be
pursue
overly
broad
interpretation
of
statutory
language
relate
to
the
term
involve
gaming
and
activity
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
while
the
proposal
may
achieve
the
commission
short
term
goal
of
ban
election
contract
it
will
come
at
the
expense
of
a
consistent
clear
and
well
support
regulatory
regime
surround
the
listing
of
event
contract
give
this
potential
to
stunt
the
growth
of
a
new
and
innovative
market
forecastex
can
not
support
the
commission
proposal
a
comprehensive
regime
surround
event
contract
be
need
but
this
proposal
be
not
it
to
be
clear
forecastex
be
not
comment
on
the
merit
of
election
contract
instead
forecastex
be
deeply
concerned
by
the
process
through
which
the
commission
be
go
about
its
prohibition
event
contract
be
a
new
and
develop
field
of
product
and
forecastex
suspect
that
the
commission
have
not
yet
fully
evaluate
or
consider
all
of
the
potential
consequence
of
this
rulemaking
as
a
self
regulatory
organization
that
have
be
solely
focus
on
event
contract
for
close
to
three
year
forecastex
believe
it
may
be
uniquely
suit
to
comment
on
these
downstream
consequence
forecastex
hop
that
its
comment
will
be
helpful
to
the
commission
as
it
attempt
the
complicated
task
of
regulate
this
innovative
category
of
product
contract
that
involve
enumerate
activity
forecastex
request
that
the
commission
provide
additional
guidance
as
to
when
a
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
the
commission
be
propose
to
revise
cftc
regulation
so
that
it
refer
to
event
contract
that
involve
an
enumerate
activity
89

however
the
only
guidance
that
the
commission
give
as
to
when
a
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
plain
mean
definition
of
involve
from
several
dictionary
the
commission
also
state
that
a
contract
may
involve
an
enumerate
activity
even
in
situation
where
the
contract
underlie
be
not
an
enumerate
activity
89
fr
48968
48974
as
currently
propose
cftc
regulation
will
not
give
designate
entity
clarity
as
to
what
contract
be
prohibit
under
cftc
rule
an
argument
could
be
make
that
virtually
any
conceivable
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
for
example
terrorist
attack
have
historically
have
large
impact
on
economy
and
financial
market
do
a
contract
on
the
gdp
growth
rate
involve
terrorism
because
terrorism
to
or
gdp
growth
and
an
event
contract
position
predict
gdp
growth
as
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
the
prediction
that
there
will
not
be
a
large
scale
terrorist
attack
that
cause
massive
economic
damage
do
an
event
contract
with
a
global
climate
underlie
such
as
a
global
drought
index
involve
war
because
it
have
be
show
that
climate
change
relate
closely

the

do
an
event
contract
on
corporate
profit
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
if
it
be
show
that
at
least
one
company
whose
profit
be
include
earn
a
portion
of
their
profit
through
unlawful
mean
similarly
do
an
event
contract
on
the
revenue
collect
by
a
state
government
entail
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
law
since
a
portion
of
the
revenue
will
be
from
fine
collect
for
violation
of
state
law
while
gdp
growth
and
corporate
profit
contract
could
not
be
prohibit
under
regulation
because
they
meet
the
definition
of
an
exclude
commodity
under
cea
section
a
broad
interpretation
of
involve
could
conceivably
be
use
to
prohibit
any
other
contract
forecastex
do
not
believe
that
it
be
the
commission
intent
to
prohibit
these
type
of
contract
and
forecastex
strongly
believe
that
such
contract
should
not
be
consider
to
involve
enumerate
activity
however
by
leave
the
definition
of
involve
vague
the
proposal
leave
open
the
possibility
that
the
commission
could
prohibit
any
contract
because
it
involve
an
enumerate
activity
the
possibility
be
also
raise
that
the
rule
may
be
apply
arbitrarily
with
some
contract
be
accept
and
other
reject
when
contract
have
a
similar
tangential
relationship
to
the
enumerate
activity
this
problem
be
worsen
by
the
commission
propose
to
categorically
prohibit
any
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
at
least
under
the
current
rule
the
commission
have
to
determine
both
that
a
contract
involve
or
relate
to
an
enumerate
activity
and
that
it
additionally
be
against
the
public
interest
the
proposal
would
prohibit
any
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
regardless
of
any
positive
public
interest
benefit
finally
a
broad
interpretation
of
involve
will
likely
increase
the
amount
of
resource
that
the
commission
have
to
devote
to
review
event
contract
since
nearly
every
propose
contract
could
involve
an
enumerate
activity
under
the
interpretation
result
in
an
increase
number
of
review
the
commission
state
that
its
purpose
in
propose
the
amendment
to
cftc
regulation
be
to
support
effort
by
register
entity
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
by
more
clearly
identify
the
type
of
event
contract
that
may
not
be
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clear
89

unless
the
commission
more
clearly
define
when
a
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
the
propose
amendment
to
cftc
regulation
will
not
achieve
this
goal
while
the
commission
can
not
foresee
every
possible
event
contract
that
could
be
submit
involve
enumerate
activity
it
be
not
unreasonable
to
expect
the
commission
to
provide
guideline
describe
when
they
would
consider
such
a
situation
to
exist
forecastex
suggest
the
follow
three
criterion
as
a
starting
point
for
such
guidance
first
the
commission
should
recognize
that
an
enumerate
activity
affect
the
outcome
of
an
event
contract
be
not
a
sufficient
basis
alone
for
determine
that
an
event
contract
involve
the
enumerate
activity
make
this
recognition
in
its
guidance
will
appropriately
limit
the
scope
of
the
enumerate
activity
as
the
list
of
event
contract
that
affect
or
be
affect
by
an
enumerate
activity
be
close
to
infinitely
broad

this
standard

since

definition
of

the

should

apply

of

definition
to

because
of
how
broadly
interpreting
involve
to
mean
affect
would
apply
the
statute
defining
involve
to
mean
only
a
necessary
part
would
provide
a
clear
guideline
for
market
participant
register
entity
and
the
commission
to
evaluate
potential
contract
this
guideline
would
provide
clarity
that
all
four
of
the
contract
describe
early
do
not
involve
enumerate
activity
second
the
commission
should
specify
that
an
event
contract
be
consider
to
involve
an
enumerate
activity
when
an
enumerate
activity
or
the
extent
of
an
enumerate
activity
be
likely
to
determine
the
outcome
of
the
event
underlie
the
event
contract
this
be
an
appropriate
way
of
determine
if
an
enumerate
activity
be
a
necessary
part
of
a
contract
for
example
a
measure
of
corporate
profit
may
include
some
profit
which
be
earn
through
unlawful
mean
but
such
profit
would
represent
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total
corporate
profit
and
an
increase
or
decrease
in
illicit
activity
would
be
unlikely
to
be
a
significant
enough
portion
of
corporate
profit
in
order
to
cause
the
outcome
of
a
corporate
profit
event
contract
to
change
third
the
commission
should
specify
that
contract
that
have
an
identical
risk
profile
as
a
contract
on
an
enumerate
activity
involve
that
enumerate
activity
in
other
word
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
if
they
serve
as
a
proxy
for
a
contract
on
enumerate
activity
for
example
take
a
hypothetical
event
contract
will
there
be
a
victory
parade
in
downtown
kansas
city
between
february
10
2025
and
february
17
2025
while
such
a
contract
would
potentially
not
meet
the
commission
propose
gaming
definition
since
many
different
victory
parade
could
hypothetically
cause
the
contract
to
settle
to
yes
the
contract
provide
essentially
the
same
risk
profile
as
the
contract
will
the
kansas
city
chiefs
win
super
bowl
lviii
which
clearly
be
a
gaming
contract
this
standard
ensure
that
it
be
clear
to
register
entity
that
they
can
not
avoid
the
restriction
on
enumerate
activity
by
list
perfectly
or
nearly
perfectly
correlate
event
the
above
guideline
if
adopt
by
the
cftc
note
that
adopt
these
or
similar
guideline
would
not
require
a
re
proposal
because
such
guidance
could
be
articulate
in
the
final
rule
and
would
not
necessitate
an
amendment
to
the
propose
language
would
give
register
entity
clear
boundary
while
also
not
require
the
commission
to
undertake
an
excessive
number
of
review
which
be
disruptive
for
market
participant
costly
for
register
entity
and
resource
intensive
for
the
commission
ii
propose

definition
forecastex
be
not
comment
on
the
virtue
of

event
contract
however
forecastex
be
concern
with
the
process
that
the
commission
be
employ
through
this
propose
rulemake
in
order
to
prohibit
these
contract
the
commission
appear
to
be
primarily
concerned
with
create
a
definition
of
gaming
that
exclude
political
event
contract
as
oppose
to
a
definition
that
align
with
congressional
intent
and
bring
clarity
to
market
include
election
and
other
contest
in
the
definition
of
gaming
do
not
appear
consistent
with
congressional
intent
in
the
colloquy
between
senator
lincoln
and
feinstein
when
explain
the
gaming
provision
senator
lincoln
articulate
that
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
event
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
master
golf
tournament
these
type
of
contract
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose

the
only
example
of
gaming
give
in
the
colloquy
be
sport
event
furthermore
give
that
gaming
be
not
commonly
understand
to
include
election
it
appear
likely
that
congress
would
have
articulate
election
as
a
separate
enumerate
category
if
they
intend
for
it
to
be
an
enumerate
activity

point

congress
easily
could
have
include
election
and
award
as

activity
but
it
do
not
confront
with
this
congressional
silence
I
do
not
believe
the
commission
can
simply
decree
that
election
and
award
be
enumerate
activity
as
a
result
the
commission
game
definition
be
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
instead
the
commission
should
adopt
a
definition
of
gaming
that
be
limit
to
contract
on
the
outcome
of

contract
on
the
performance
of

any

a
second
problem

definition
relate
to
how
the

frame
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
be
not
wholly
dependent
on

the

to

this

virtually
any

the

articulate
a

concern
in
the
proposal
when
justify
its
position
that

be
universally
prohibit
the

about
conflate

while
the
commission
be
discuss
the
risk
of
allow
gaming
product
to
trade

the

effect
could
occur

even
if

as

a
conflation
of

in
a
manner
that
could
confuse

it
be

the

can
side
step
this

entirely
by
adopt
a
more
clear
and
well
define

of

as

find
in

that

preempt

the

inevitably
lead

the

correct
wagering

when
it

when
the

reinterpret

that

can
no

do
not

congressional
intent
of
cea
section
hedging
value
of
event
contract
forecastex
believe
it
be
important
for
the
commission
to
recognize
that
hedge
in
an
event
market
may
not
appear
like
a
typical
hedge
in
other
market
that
the
commission
regulate
event
contract
typically
do
not
provide
a
1
pure
hedge
for
other
financial
instrument
instead
they
provide
hedge
for
specific
risk
within
a
give
portfolio
market
participant
can
use
event
contract
to
hedge
risk
in
their
financial
portfolio
uncertainty
about
event
particularly
uncertainly
relate
to
macroeconomic
and
climate
risk
expose
participant
in
financial
market
to
substantial
risk
see
for
example
turan
bali
stephen
brown
and
yi
tang
macroeconomic
uncertainty
and
expect
stock
return
american
economic
association
december
2014
these
risk
can
not
accurately
be
hedge
without
event
contract
instead
participant
in
financial
market
must
hedge
their
exposure
after
macroeconomic
datum
release
occur
typically
on
trading
day
with
a
major
macroeconomic
release
a
flurry
of
activity
in
bond
and
equity
market
follow
the
release
with
increase
price
volatility
these
release
give
market
participant
new
information
and
significant
surprise
in
the
release
expose
participant
to
unwanted
risk
for
example
just
this
past
week
significant
market
turmoil
result
from
a
high
than
expect
unemployment
rate
and
low
than
expect
payroll
in
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
current

situation
report
on
friday
august

2024
at
et
the
current
employment
situation
report
for
july
2024
show
unemployment
which
be
above
market
consensus
estimate
and
a
increase
in
payroll
employment
which
be
below
market
consensus
estimate
the
500
index
open
at
et
low
than
the
previous
night
close
participant
then
must
hedge
the
risk
they
do
not
fully
understand
previously
after
the
macroeconomic
release
event
contract
have
the
potential
to
revolutionize
this
process
since
event
contract
pay
participant
when
macroeconomic
release
be
high
or
low
than
expect
they
allow
participant
to
hedge
risk
associate
with
these
announcement
for
example
market
participant
who
hold
retail
stock
may
hedge
their
exposure
to
a
poor
retail
sale
report
by
purchase
event
contract
that
pay
out
when
retail
sale
be
low
than
expect
alternatively
a
bond
investor
could
use
event
contract
on
inflation
level
to
hedge
their
bond
portfolio
due
to
inflation
impact
on
interest
rate
use
event
contract
allow
participant
to
directly
hedge
these
macroeconomic
risk
see
for
example

and
rare

risk
in
asset
price
march

available

which
demonstrate
that
a
binary
recession
prediction
market
can
be
use
as
a
hedge
for
macroeconomic
recession
risk
in
equity
and
bond
market
before
the
macroeconomic
datum
be
release
importantly
because
event
contract
be
specifically
target
at
specific
event
and
macroeconomic
datum
release
they
allow
participant
to
hedge
their
exposure
to
that
particular
event
without
sacrifice
all
of
the
upside
in
their
instrument
like
a
1
pure
hedge
would
require
no
other
derivative
now
available
in
the

those

may

for

they
may
want
to
know
how
uncertain
the
market
be
about
its
future
estimate
and
whether
that
uncertainty
be
skewed
to
one
side
or
the
other
event
contract
can
help
make
market
more
complete
by
provide
this
information
a
series
of
event
contract
with
the
same
underlying
event
but
different
threshold
price
can
help
estimate
the
cumulative
market
forecast
distribution
of
uncertain
future
value
for
example
take
a
series
of
event
contract
base
on
average
global
temperature
in
2040
with
increment
between
degree
celsius
above
the
20
th
century
average
to
degree
celsius
above
the
20
th
century
average
the
price
of
these
contract
would
show
the
probability
of
any
give
temperature
and
together
form
a
probability
distribution
that
would
allow
hedger
to
see
the
uncertainty
and
skewness
in
the
market
prediction
this
would
allow
hedger
to
construct
any
hedge
they
need
to
hedge
their
non
linear
risk
forecast
contract
will
help
improve
efficiency
by
allow
participant
to
hedge
risk
they
can
not
currently
these
contract
thus
will
help
complete
the

as
a
result
the

should
recognize

predictive
power
of

market
be
effectively
price
basing
even
if
the
cftc
do
not
want
to
consider
it
price
base
the
cftc
should
recognize
the
informational
value
of
event
contract
as
a
positive
public
interest
factor
that
should
be
at
the
forefront
of
any
public
interest
evaluation
give
that
informational
value
of
event
contract
be
typically
tout
as
their
main
public
interest
benefit
in
academic
research
forecastex
find
it
troubling
that
the
commission
do
not
mention
these
benefit
when
discuss
the
public
interest
factor
it
will
consider
other
than
a
couple
pass
mention
to
traditional
price
basing
while
event
contract
reduce
uncertainty
about
the
future
the
value
of
that
predictive
power
will
vary
depend
on
the
underlie
event
as
not
every
reduction
in
uncertainty
create
a
public
good
for
example
a
gaming
contract
base
on
the
outcome
of
the
kentucky
derby
be
unlikely
to
create
any
public
good
even
if
it
reduce
the
uncertainty
involve
in
the
outcome
of
the
kentucky
derby
there
be
four
criterion
that
the
commission
should
be
evaluate
when
determine
if
the
price
basing
function
of
an
event
contract
contribute
to
the
public
good
first
do
the
event
contract
generate
information
that
be
useful
for
business
when
plan
their
future
decision
this
be
akin
the
classic
formulation
of
price
basing
in
future
market
a
farmer
may
use
the
future
price
of
agricultural
good
to
determine
the
future
supply
and
demand
on
various
crop
which
be
a
useful
informational
input
when
determine
which
crop
should
be
plant
in
a
give
year
similarly
a
business
can
glean
information
from
various
event
contract
to
determine
their
optimal
strategy
for
example
an
event
contract
on
retail
sale
would
provide
a
useful
input
for
a
business
decide
whether
or
not
to
expand
its
operation
as
retail
sale
projection
can
be
use
to
forecast
future
demand
for
good
second
do
the
event
underlie
the
contract
provide
information
that
impact
the
pricing
of
other
financial
product
this
be
similar
though
subtly
different
than
evaluate
the
hedge
utility
of
a
contract
for
example
an
event
contract
on
whether
or
not
a
recession
will
occur
within
a
give
timeframe
would
provide
useful
information
to
an
investor
who
be
try
to
determine
whether
or
not
equity
be
overvalue
regardless
of
whether
they
be
attempt
to
hedge
equity
exposure
third
do
the
event
contract
provide
valuable
information
to
the
non
invest
public
the
informational
benefit
that
an
event
contract
provide
be
not
necessarily
limit
to
individual
who
be
actively
involve
in
financial
market
for
example
an
event
contract
base
upon
the
number
of
manufacturing
job
could
provide
factory
worker
with
valuable
insight
into
their
job
security
over
the
medium
to
long
run
regardless
of
their
investment
portfolio
finally
do
the
event
contract
provide
information
that
will
be
valuable
to
policymaker
for
example
an
event
contract
base
on
the
amount
of
co2
in
the
atmosphere
would
provide
policymaker
with
estimate
of
future
carbon
emission
provide
a
clear
estimate
of
the
public
belief
on
the
future
trajectory
of
global
warming
while
also
provide
an
estimate
of
future
pollution
level
all
of
which
would
be
valuable
to
a
policymaker
determine
climate
policy
if
the
answer
to
any
of
the
four
criterion
be
yes
that
should
be
weigh
in
favor
of
the
contract
in
the
commission
public
interest
analysis
a
contract
in
which
multiple
criterion
be
weight
positively
be
highly
unlikely
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
above
approach
be
reinforce
by
examine
the
exclude
commodity
describe
in
cea
section
contract
on
these
exclude
commodity
which
congress
identify
as
in
the
public
interest
due
to
their
exclusion
from
review
be
likely
to
provide
significant
informational
benefit
and
reduction
in
uncertainty
for
business
investor
the
general
public
as
well
as
policymaker
any
of
the
contract
that
the
cftc
have
identify
as
fall
under
section
exclusion
would
show
significant
price
basing
benefit
under
the
crtieria
propose
above
this
demonstrate
that
our
propose
approach
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent
evaluation
of
the
price
basing
or
informational
value
of
an
event
contract
should
be
a
critical
piece
of
any
public
interest
analysis
educational
value
of
event
contract
apart
from
the
value
that
event
contract
offer
as
hedging
and
informational
vehicle
event
contract
also
contribute
to
the
public
interest
because
of
their
educational
value
this
positive
public
interest
factor
have
not
be
recognize
by
the
commission
fundamentally
event
contract
create
a
financial
incentive
for
market
participant
to
be
well
inform
about
the
event
that
be
the
subject
of
various
event
contract
at
the
same
time
event
contract
punish
false
belief
by
subject
their
holder
to
financial
penalty
the
result
be
an
incentive
system
which
reward
participant
who
garner
great
knowledge
and
discard
false
belief
in
fact
research
have
demonstrate
that
participation
in
event
market
can
change
opinion
about
complex
and
entrenched
belief
like

the

forecastex
disagree
with
the
commission
assertion
that

contract
be
more
susceptible

when
there
be
no

there
be
three
reason
for
this
first
event
contract
price
do
not
impact
the
likelihood
of
the
underlie
event
as
a
result
a
market
participant
trading
an
event
contract
have
no
way
of
alter
or
change
the
underlie
event
this
substantially
reduce
the
incentive
that
market
participant
have
to
engage
in
manipulation
a
contract
will
still
have
the
same
event
resolution
and
final
settlement
value
of
0
or
1
regardless
of
any
manipulative
activity
that
occur
in
the
contract
far
because
the
price
of
an
event
market
without
an
underlie
spot
market
be
not
perfectly
correlate
to
any
particular
financial
instrument
it
become
impractical
to
attempt
any
cross
market
manipulation
strategy
where
a
participant
would
attempt
to
change
the
price
of
a
secondary
derivative
or
market
by
manipulate
the
price
of
the
event
contract
second

I
maintain

assure

have
the

to
prevent

that
would

also
prevent

this

as
articulate
by
the

fundamentally
misunderstand
how
financial

work
and
misinterpret
the
colloquy
between

feinstein
whether
a

allow
a

from

to
any

be
an
unworkable
standard
because
every

another
from
these

almost
always
signal
harm
to
one
group
of

or
another
meaning
that
holder
of
the

have
the
opportunity
to
profit
off
of
that
harm
for
example
if
the

will

conversely
if
the

dramatically
decrease
the
price
of

future
oil

business
will
suffer

the

be
correlate
with
a
risk
that
cause

to
a

on
an
even
more
fundamental
level
if
one

profit

another

suffer

the
only
way
that

it

receive

that
correlate

cause

the
perspective
that
the
cftc
should
take
towards
these
sort
of
situation
be
not
that
market
participant
be
benefit
from
harm
to
other
person
but
instead
that
they
be
profit
from
be
able
to
make
accurate
prediction
and
share
that
information
with
the

the
informational
value
of
be
able
to
predict
a
negative
outcome
be
just
as
great
if
not
great
than
the
value
of
predict
a
positive
one
it
be
in
the
public

for
individual
who
can
accurately
predict
impend
harm
to

or
a
group
of
person
to
be
incentivize
to
share
that
information
a
contract
which
allow
an
individual
to
profit
when
harm
occur
to
a
person
or
group
of
person
be
not
against
the
public

furthermore
the
commission
have
misinterpret
the
congressional
record
relate
to
the
lincoln
colloquy
the
commission
be
make
a
sizeable
jump
from
senator
lincoln
language
relate
to
disastrous
event
to
the
much
broad
category
of
harm
to
any
person
or
group
of
person
there
be
no
evidence
that
congress
want
the
statute
interpret
this
broadly
it
appear
unlikely
that
be
congress
intent
give
that
they
recognize
the
value
of
hedging
in
cftc
regulate

a
future
market
be
for

156

and
as
demonstrate
previously
any
useful
hedge
contract
will
necessarily
involve
a
participant
profit
off
of
an
event
that
could
harm
other
additionally
base
on
the
full
context
of
the
colloquy
the
disastrous
event
comment
by
senator
lincoln
appear
to
have
be
a
topline
summary
of
the
conference
report
position
senator
lincoln
elaborate
far
on
this
statement
later
in
the
colloquy
specifically
she
state
national
security
threat
such
as
a
terrorist
attack
war
or
hijacking
pose
a
real
commercial
risk
to
many
business
in
america
but
a
future
contract
that
allow
people
to
hedge
that
risk
would
also
involve
bet
on
the
likelihood
of
event
that
threaten
our
national
security
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
give
this
elaboration
it
appear
that
her
statement
about
disastrous
event
be
much
more
limited
than
the
cftc
have
interpret
it
senator
lincoln
elaboration
seem
to
instead
imply
that
the
prohibition
she
be
discuss
be
relate
to
the
enumerate
category
of
terrorism
assassination
and
war
this
more
limited
interpretation
of
the
colloquy
be
superior
because
it
do
not
require
undermine
fundamental
market
principle
finally
the
commission
should
instead
adopt
a
refined
standard
which
be
much
narrow
and
more
specifically
address
the
concern
raise
by
senator
lincoln
and
feinstein
there
be
a
common
thread
between
the
national
security
enumerate
category
of
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
outcome
of
an
event
contract
involve
any
of
these
three
category
can
be
alter
by
the
action
of
a
single
person
or
entity
this
be
problematic
because
it
give
individual
an
actionable
financial
incentive
to
attempt
to
change
the
outcome
by
commit
violent
act
a
terrorist
organization
could
purchase
contract
about
whether
a
terrorist
attack
will
occur
and
then
execute
just
such
an
attack
give
they
a
financial
incentive
and
additional
funding
for
pursue
their
goal
a
sovereign
nation
or
their
agent
could
purchase
contract
about
whether
or
not
they
will
invade
another
country
and
then
use
the
contract
to
fund
their
war
effort
such
incentive
be
clearly
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
could
still
recognize
the
potential
damage
that
these
contract
could
cause
by
adopt
the
follow
standard
do
the
contract
create
an
actionable
financial
incentive
for
an
individual
or
entity
to
attempt
to
change
the
outcome
of
the
contract
by
commit
act
of
violence
or
engage
in
illegal
activity
this
standard
would
focus
the
commission
review
on
whether
the
contract
would
incentivize
activity
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
standard
contain
the
term
actionable
as
for
an
incentive
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
have
to
be
large
enough
that
it
be
likely
to
change
someone
behavior
a
contract
on
assassination
or
terrorism
create
an
actionable
incentive
because
one
person
can
change
the
outcome
a
contract
on
the
amount
of
revenue
a
state
receive
from
traffic
light
camera
do
not
create
an
actionable
incentive
because
even
if
an
individual
attempt
to
influence
outcome
by
incur
a
massive
number
of
fine
the
financial
penalty
of
the
fine
would
create
a
large
disincentive
and
even
if
they
incur
hundred
of
fine
it
would
be
unlikely
that
their
action
would
alter
the
total
revenue
to
the
extent
that
it
would
change
the
outcome
of
the
contract
forecastex
also
note
that
this
analysis
should
apply
to
economic
indicator
as
well
even
though
one
could
argue
that
start
a
war
or
conduct
a
terrorist
attack
could
potentially
cause
enough
impact
on
an
economy
to
change
the
outcome
of
an
economic
event
contract
those
impact
would
be
diffuse
and
hard
to
predict
make
it
unlikely
that
this
method
could
be
use
effectively
furthermore
currently
exist
economic
contract
such
as
the
500
stock
index
could
theoretically
be
use
in
the
same
manner
so
economic
contract
will
not
be
create
a
new
incentive
there
be
also
no
evidence
that
entity
have
use
exist
economic
contract
for
such
purpose
make
it
unlikely
that
these
strategy
would
be
employ
due
to
the
enumerate

of

that
be
illegal
under
federal
and
state
law
an
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
even
non
violent

also
incorporate
into
the
standard
the
review
of
whether
an
activity
encourage
illegal
activity
should
be
separate
from
the
analysis
of
whether
a
contract
be
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation

review

not

whether

manipulation

insider
trading

review

adequately
assess
this
question

the

this

the

be
attempt
to
pass
a

on
a

in

to
support

the

need
to

instead
the

make

which
have

this

for

and
certainly
not

the

89
fr
48968
48981
this
argument
as
the
cftc
have
formulate
it
do
not
support
a
universal
ban
the
commission
state
that
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
potentially
in
some
circumstance
create
a
profit
opportunity
off
of
illegal

necessarily
this
mean
that
sometimes
in
other
circumstance
such
a
profit
opportunity
be
not
create
if
by
the
commission
own
admission
public
harm
be
not
universally
create
by
these
contract
than
a
universal
ban
can
not
be
justify
this
sentiment
be
echo
by
commissioner
mersinger
in
her
dissent
a
belief
for
which
no
evidence
be
cite
and
that
be
acknowledge
not
to
be
true
across
the
board
can
not
justify
an
absolutist
determination
that
all
event
contract
involve
an
activity
be
automatically
contrary
to
the

can
it
justify
a
prohibition
on

all

category
89

furthermore
the
commission
argument
have
the
same
problem
as
the
harm
standard
they
articulate
early
in
their
proposal
such
a
contract
would
only
be
against
the
public
interest
and
would
only
undermine
state
interest
if
it
create
an
actionable
incentive
to
engage
in
the
unlawful
activity
that
be
the
basis
of
the
contract
the
commission
claim
of
this
be
an
issue
of
comity
with
state
have
a
similar
problem
if
person
be
not
incentivize
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
the
commission
do
not
articulate
any
way
that
state
interest
be
undermine
it
could
be
argue
that
if
an
event
contract
show
that
state
policy
be
likely
to
have
negative
consequence
or
be
ineffective
that
this
undermine
state
interest
because
it
could
be
embarrassing
to
state
policymaker
even
if
true
this
interest
would
necessarily
be
less
than
the
public
interest
serve
by
bring
information
about
a
state
failure
to
the
public
attention
in
fact
if
there
be
no
actionable
incentive
a
contract
may
support
state
interest
as
the
informational
value
of
the

could
assist
state
policymaker
have
an
accurate
assessment
of
how
much
illegal

be
likely
to
occur
be
in
the

the

can
effectively
assess
whether
a

undermine

adopt
the

standard
we
propose

the

a

be
contrary

turn
the
focus
of

analysis
to
the
question
of
whether
the

itself
be

as
unlawful
and
if
so
whether
the

involve
such
unlawful

eliminate
the
possibility
that

these

make
it
inevitable
that

will
involve
the

act

of
state
public

determination
second
the
commission
can
avoid
act
as
an
arbiter
by
adopt
the
actionable
financial
incentive
standard
with
this
standard
the
commission
do
not
have
to
rule
whether
a
state
law
be
in
the
public
interest
or
not
instead
it
only
have
to
examine
whether
the
contract
give
individual
an
incentive
to
break
those
law
the
commission
should
abandon
its
propose
universal
prohibition
and
instead
judge
contract
that
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
federal
and
state
law
with
the
actionable
financial
incentive
standard
furthermore
the
three
paragraph
that
the
commission
present
in
its
proposal
to
support
a
universal
ban
on
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
contain
such
weak
analysis
that
it
do
not
even
justify
the
prohibition
of
extreme
contract
relate
to
unlawful
activity
take
the
hypothetical
contract
will
the
us
violent
crime
rate
be
above
x
level
in
2025
it
be
not
at
all
clear
how
such
a
contract
would
undermine
state
interest
the
commission
assert
such
contract
be
problematic
because
they
create
opportunity
to
profit
from
illegal
activity
89
fr
48981
that
contract
do
not
create
an
actionable
incentive
for
a
person
to
commit
violent
crime
one
individual
or
entity
do
not
have
sufficient
resource
to
affect
the
violent
crime
rate
in
any
meaningful
way
certainly
not
to
the
extent
that
it
would
create
the
possibility
of
profit
off
of
the
above
hypothetical
event
contract
by
engage
in
violence
the
only
other
reasoning
be
that
if
the
contract
create
the
possibility
of
profit
off
of
an
illegal
event
whether
or
not
the
contract
create
an
actual
incentive
to
do
that
event
the
contract
should
be
prohibit
as
have
be
previously
argue
such
a
standard
would
run
counter
to
the
way
that
market
work
and
would
be
inconsistent
with
how
virtually
every
other
one
of
the
commission
market
be
regulate
profit
off
of
harm
to
a
group
of
person
be
an
essential
feature
of
any
derivative
contract
as
a
result
the
reasoning
present
by
the
commission
do
not
articulate
a
single
public
interest
concern
that
would
justify
prohibit
the
above
contract
in
fact
there
be
significant
public
interest
consideration
that
would
suggest
such
a
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
event
contract
be
a
powerful
predictive
tool
that
can
aggregate
diverse
opinion
and
set
of
information
into
accurate
forecast
as
we
have
previously
demonstrate
have
accurate
forecast
about
likely
future
trend
in
violent
crime
be
clearly
in
the
public
interest
and
support
rather
than
undermine
state
interest
that
information
can
provide
policymaker
with
a
valuable
tool
to
gauge
the
effectiveness
of
current
policy
at
combat
violent
crime
it
appear
likely
that
the
forecasting
value
of
event
contract
provide
more
of
a
public
good
than
any
public
harm
create
by
incentivize
violent
activity
at
the
very
least
contract
such
as
these
have
a
complex
web
of
public
good
consideration
which
should
be
evaluate
on
a
case
by
case
basis
as
oppose
to
be
subject
to
a
universal
prohibition
this
be
not
to
say
that
every
single
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
be
in
the
public
interest
quite
the
contrary
for
example
a
contract
base
on
the
amount
or
value
of
narcotic
seize
by
the
us
border
patrol
during
a
give
timeframe
could
provide
a
means
for
international
criminal
organization
to
hedge
against
the
risk
of
more
of
their
narcotic
be
seize
than
they
expect
this
would
certainly
create
an
actionable
incentive
to
engage
in
illicit
activity
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
point
forecastex
be
try
to
emphasize
be
that
the
topic
of
illegal
activity
be
complex
and
contract
involve
these
activity
deserve
case
by
case
attention
as
oppose
to
universal
prohibition
a
categorical
ban
may
lead
to
market
disruption
law
change
it
be
entirely
possible
that
an
event
contract
when
list
do
not
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
but
due
to
a
change
in
state
or
federal
legislation
regulation
or
judicial
interpretation
such
activity
become
unlawful
during
the
life
of
an
event
contract
this
would
force
a
dcm
or
sef
to
halt
trading
in
exist
contract
which
could
have
a
disruptive
impact
on
market
force
market
participant
to
pre
maturely
close
their
position
could
disrupt
their
trading
strategy
and
cause
they
to
take
loss
during
liquidation
not
to
mention
the
difficulty
this
process
would
cause
for
a
register
entity
attempt
to
implement
this
type
of
change
in
an
orderly
fashion
this
would
be
especially
problematic
in
situation
where
a
law
be
vacate
by
a
federal
court
make
a
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
a
court
decision
could
be
appeal
to
a
high
court
and
potentially
overturn
situation
could
arise
where
a
district
court
decision
make
an
activity
illegal
and
thus
make
event
contract
relate
to
that
activity
prohibit
under
the
cftc
proposal
subsequent
to
the
market
disruption
that
occur
from
delist
active
product
an
appeal
court
could
overturn
the
district
court
decision
potentially
create
further
disruption
the
loser
in
these
situation
will
be
market
participant
who
have
position
in
these
contract
the
commission
should
evaluate
contract
differently
when
a
change
in
law
or
judicial
interpretation
make
activity
unlawful
the
market
disruption
that
could
occur
from
delist
actively
trade
contract
be
a
public
interest
concern
that
should
be
take
into
account
when
determine
if
a
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
a
categorical
ban
on
product
involve
unlawful
activity
deprive
the
commission
of
the
need
flexibility
to
address
delicate
situation
where
the
law
change
for
example
the
cftc
could
determine
to
allow
the
contract
that
be
currently
list
to
remain
list
until
expiration
while
also
require
that
dcms
and
sef
not
list
any
additional
strike
or
expiration
of
those
contract
which
would
dramatically
reduce
any
market
disruption
associate
with
these
type
of
event
case
by
case
analysis
be
the
most
appropriate
course
of
action
the
number
of
list
contract
the
liquidity
of
the
list
contract
the
open
interest
in
the
list
contract
whether
market
participant
roll
their
position
in
the
list
market
into
future
expiration
to
execute
their
risk
management
strategy
and
the
time
to
expiration
of
the
list
contract
would
all
be
important
factor
that
should
be
consider
when
examine
the
extent
of
any
potential
market
disruption
because
of
the
wide
degree
of
variability
in
these
factor
a
one
size
fit
all
approach
do
not
appear
appropriate
many
category
of
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
be
in
the
public
interest
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
in
a
single
or
a
minority
of
state
can
not
be
presume
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
the
commission
correctly
note
there
be
variation
across
state
law
in
the
specific
action
that
be
recognize
as
unlawful
89
fr
48981
due
to
this
variation
many
activity
that
would
be
recognize
as
lawful
in
one
jurisdiction
would
be
unlawful
in
another
jurisdiction
this
be
of
particular
concern
when
deal
with
the
variation
in
business
regulation
licensing
labor
law
and
the
sale
of
good
in
these
circumstance
a
total
ban
on
event
contract
involve
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
will
have
much
more
far
reach
consequence
than
the
commission
likely
intend
for
example
many

would
be

in

these

this
make
the

of

unlawful

because
the

do
not
have
the
appropriate
prop

warning
label
as
a
result
it
could
easily
be
determine
that
any

california

among

on

level
involve

since
those

65
such

could
serve
clear
hedging
and

further
such
contract
would
not
create
an
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
act
or
allow
market
participant
to
profit
from
illegal
activity
any
reason
public
interest
analysis
would
not
find
that
such
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
second
issue
with
a
universal
prohibition
on
contract
involve
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
be
that
it
effectively
empower
state
government
to
dictate
national
policy
the
commission
suggest
that
if
an
activity
be
unlawful
in
some
state
but
not
other
the
cftc
will
automatically
through
its
categorical
prohibition
ban
trading
in
event
contract
relate
to
that
activity
the
decision
of
one
state
government
will
limit
the
type
of
financial
transaction
that
citizen
of
all
50
state
will
be
able
to
participate
in
this
upset
the
balance
and
separation
of
power
between
federal
and
state
lawmaker
the
government
of
florida
should
not
be
able
to
determine
what
kind
of
financial
product
resident
of
new
york
can
trade
and
vice
versa
in
an
extreme
example
a
single
state
pass
a
law
which
determine
that
the
risking
or
staking
of
money
upon
event
relate
to
weather
or
climate
be
illegal
under
the
cftc
proposal
the
state
would
effectively
be
set
national
policy
by
take
advantage
of
the
cftc
universal
prohibition
to
prohibit
all
contract
relate
to
weather
and
climate
nationally
in
keep
with
previous
point
forecastex
be
not
argue
that
all
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
law
should
be
determine
to
be
in
the
public
interest
instead
the
commission
should
recognize
that
the
intricacy
of
overlap
and
compete
state
law
be
a
complicated
topic
not
suit
for
universal
prohibition
whether
or
not
a
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
law
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
be
determine
on
a
case
by
case
basis
contract
which
depend
on
legislative
and
judicial
determination
of
legality
should
be
consider
to
be
in
the
public
interest
under
the
broad
category
of
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
there
be
a
sub
category
of
product
which
should
generally
be
determine
to
be
in
the
public
interest
contract
which
revolve
around
the
decision
of
legislative
and
judicial
body
about
the
legality
of
certain
action
example
of
contract
in
this
category
could
include
I
will
new
hampshire
pass
a
right
to

law
before
the
end
of

ii
will

vi
will

by
the
end

such
contract
would
likely
be
consider
to
involve
unlawful
activity
because
they
deal
with
activity
that
be
currently
unlawful
or
will
be
unlawful
depend
on
the
resolution
of
the
contract
as
previously

it

for

the

turn
on
the
question
of
whether
google
commit
unlawful
activity
an
assault

would
make
the
possession
of

unlawful
these
contract
do
not
raise
the
same
concern
as
contract
that
the
commission
be
look
to
prohibit
contract
on
whether
a
legislative
body
will
take
a
give
action
do
not
give
market
participant
an
actionable
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
note
that
it
could
be
argue
that
such
contract
create
an
incentive
for
decisionmaker
to
alter
the
outcome
of
the
contract
however
as
long
as
a
register
entity
prohibit
the
participation
of
decisionmaker
see
for
example
forecastex
rule
509
such
a
contract
should
not
be
more
likely
to
result
in
illegal
activity
similar
protection
that
exist
in
security
market
to
prevent
insider
trading
can
be
apply
to
these
market
if
such
protection
be
in
place
it
be
unlikely
that
decisionmaker
who
can
affect
the
outcome
would
be
able
to
profit
by
trade
the
contract
and
alter
their
vote
to
influence
the
outcome
further
market
participant
do
not
even
profit
off
of
any
unlawful
activity
with
these
contract
as
they
do
not
turn
on
the
amount
of
unlawful
activity
but
simply
whether
an
activity
will
be
unlawful
or
not
there
be
no
state
interest
that
be
harm
by
the
listing
of
these
contract
furthermore
such
contract
be
highly
likely
to
create
positive
public
interest
benefit
legislative
act
can
have
significant
impact
on
the
value
of
business
and
financial
portfolio
especially
when
such
act
concern
the

finally
forecastex
believe

there
be
an
additional

the

should
add

forecastex
believe
this
provision
can
be
improve
if
the
commission
initiate
a
90
day
review
on
contract
that
have
already
begin

this
would
lead
to
market
disruption

have
the
potential
to
harm

may

exit

prior

instead
if
the
commission
initiate
a
90
day
review
on
a
product
that
have
already
begin
to
trade
the
commission
should
instead
require
the
register
entity
to
place
the
contract
into
a
close
only
state
so
that
market
participant
who
have
a
position
in
the

under

still
have
the
opportunity
to
exit
their

if

give

it

provide

the

currently
fail
to

that
by
adopt
the

have
propose
the

can
