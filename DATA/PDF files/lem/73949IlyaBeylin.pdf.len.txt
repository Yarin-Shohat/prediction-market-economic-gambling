I

at

and

event

pose
difficult
issue
as
the
cftc
contend
with
limited
resource
an
epic
expansion
of
its
regulatory
authority
under
the
dodd
frank
act
and
the
evolution
of
financial
market
the
utility
risk
and
legal
status
of
event

all
pose
complex
question
that
have
to
be
address
in
a
context
of
inadequate
legislative
guidance
and
consideration
pose
additional
challenge
for
the
cftc
in
this
response
I
address
some
but
not
all
of
the
question
pose
in

clarify
and
correct
drafting
in
cea
section
and
the
definition
of
exclude
commodity
any
rulemaking
implement
section
must
first
construe
that
subsection
intent
this
exercise
be
difficult
because
the
legislature
be
not
thoughtful
or
careful
when
draft
this
and
other
language
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
simply
put
the
lawyerly
ambition
of
elicit
congressional
intent
from
the
language
of
the
statute
be
too
optimistic
regard
the
legislative
process
notwithstanding
that
congress
wield
tremendous
power
over
the
economy
and
the
livelihood
that
depend
on
it
repeat
experience
with
drafting
show
that
this
power
be
sometimes
use
in
a
neglectful
manner
with
little
thought
or
care
expert
agency
such
as
the
cftc
be
leave
with
the
task
of
assert
congressional
intent
and
then
dress
up
chaotic
reality
in
the
garb
of
legislative
intent
through
reasoning
or
rhetoric
it
be
for
you
and
your
colleague
to
engage
in
the
linguistic
and
hopefully
somewhat
logical
task
through
which
principle
and
reality
somewhat
cohere
of
course
that
coherence
be
strained
when
the
agency
be
mire
in
political
disagreement
the
mix
of
debate
and
agitation
expose
the
weakness
and
artifice
in
agency
effort
to
achieve
sensible
regulatory
aim
that
congress
fail
to
specify
enable
far
erode
legitimacy
in
this
regard
I
recall
the
statement
then
commissioner
quintenz
issue
when
erisx
withdraw
its
three
propose
contract
that
would
settle
on
nfl
game
a
substantial
thrust
to
his
critical
observation
be
that
the
cftc
be
play
too
great
a
role
in
define
public
interest
as
a
matter
of
theory
that
be
suppose
to
be
embody
in
our
representative
democracy
there
be
substantial
merit
to
the
argument
quintenz
then
make
but
as
a
pragmatic
matter
his
vision
and
the
vision
of
inexperienced
conservative
judge
he
cite
be
unachievable
and
corrosive
it
be
for
the
cftc
to
do
the
hard
non
democratic
work
of
define
public
interest
and
otherwise
make
law
because
if
the
cftc
do
do
this
work
no
one
with
any
competence
will
many
decade
of
poor
draftsmanship
in
the
cea
confirm
this
with
that
background
there
be
basic
textual
issue
that
should
be
resolve
in
address
restriction
on
event
contract
first
there
be
the
interpretation
of
the
reference
to
section
in
the
following
language
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
exclude
commodity
that
be
base
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
price
rate
value
or
level
of
a
commodity
describe
in
section
by
a
designate
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreement
contract
or
transaction
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreement
contract
or
transaction
involve
certain
matter
prior
cftc
release
such
as
the
initial
rulemaking
have
assume
or
argue
that
the
reference
to
section
be
a
reference
to
the
first
part
of
the
exclude
commodity
definition
in
section
this
be
reflect
in
public
commentary
on
this
question
as
well

the
reference
to
be
nonsensical
the
author
believe
that
congress
instead
mean
to
refer
to
cea
a
reading
consistent
with
cea
focus
on
exclude
commodity
I
share
the
general
impression
that
here
congress
make
a
typo
particularly
due
to
the
large
but
incomplete
overlap
between
the
language
use
in
section
and
the
language
in
as
a
reminder
the
latter
subsection
include
a
reference
to
section
where
the
inexplicable
reference
to
section
occur
likely
some
congressional
staffer
hit
a
few
wrong
key
and
although
dozen
of
reviewer
be
suppose
to
catch
this
mistake
none
bother
enough
to
do
the
job
they
be
suppose
to
do
there
be
a
second
interpretive
challenge
however
here
that
do
get
as
much
attention
there
be
likely
an
error
in
the
definition
of
exclude
commodity
in
section
specifically
there
be
an
extra
negation
in

associate

in
my
view
that

intend
to

that
be
not
base
on
an

rate
exchange
rate
currency
security
macroeconomic
variable
and

otherwise
section
would
cover
only

extent
of

relate

list
in

this
result
would
make

largely
redundant
to
and
would
make
a
reference
to
it
in
the
context
of
section
make
little
sense
without
this
correction
to
which
would
strip
out
an
extra
not
contract
on
various
contest
election
nfl
game
emmys
would
not
fall
under
section
and
thus
be
treat
as
exempt
commodity
this
result
would
treat
these
event
contract
like
contract
on
energy
product
and
metal
this
result
would
also
put
they
outside
of
the
ambit
of
section
which
be
inconsistent
with
any
congressional
purpose
of
have
the
cftc
pay
extra
attention
to
contract
involve
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
etc
as
part
of
this
rulemake
the
cftc
should
clarify
the
definition
of

it

that
the

implicitly

notably
the
same
confusing
and
likely
erroneous
drafting
occur
in

and
should
also
be
clarify
as
part
of
this
rulemaking
due
to
the
centrality
of
the
exclude

definition
to

for
the
same
reason
and
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
apply
reasonable
corrective
revision
to
the
cea
I
read
the
scope
of
potential
section
prohibition
as
exclude

cover
under
section
such
as
those
base
on
a

choose

where

despite
the
high
intrinsic
interest
in

be
market
on
this
topic
have
routinely

and
there
be
common
sense
concern
with
corruption
manipulation
and
the
appearance
thereof
when
contract
settle
on
the
basis
of

by
small
group
of

individual
and
their

a

fall
under

section
would
be
one
that
settle
on
the
basis
of

rate
among
company
this
metric
unlike
the
de

corporate
tax
rate
would
be
substantially
the
product
of
economic
activity
as
oppose
to
governmental
policymake
more
generally
and
as
discuss
below
I
urge
the
cftc
to
ban
trading
of
product
base
on
outcome
attributable
to
the
deliberate
decision
of
identifiable
individual
or
organization
subject
to
a
limitation
where
the
group
become
sufficiently
large
an
industry
or
a
set
of
firm
compose
a
broad
index
of
security
naturally
question
will
be
raise
as
to
where
individual
decisionmake
aggregate
to
macro
relevance
but
the
cftc
together
with
the
sec
have
ample
experience
with
this
question
in
the
context
of
security
indice
an
arbitrary
line
will
have
to
be
draw
but
in
the
core
example
of
organizational
decisionmake
the
risk
that
market
position
influence
insider
decision
be
both
too
high
and
too
unlike
the
nature
of
risk
the
cftc
have
experience
and
expertise
police
moreover
in
these
contexts
market
be
weak
price
aggregator

define
as
a
policy
matter
which
category
of
product
will
be
prohibit
under

the

comment
on
what

should
be

be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
admittedly
this
require
the
cftc
to
engage
in
consideration
beyond
its
typical
remit
of
care
for
the
health
of
derivative
market
and
relate
cash
market
it
be
for
this
very
reason
that
a
broad
reading
of
the
prohibition
would
be
appropriate
because
enable
the
listing
of
socially
controversial
product
suspend
the
application
of
state
law
through
preemption
and
put
pressure
on
cftc
resource
as
primary
watchdog
for
the
product
while
the
cftc
be
ill
equipped
to
make
these
public
interest
determination
it
be
even
less
well
equipped
to
supervise
trading
where
it
have
implication
for
mental
health
gambling
addiction
foreign
policy
election
war
assassination
and
terrorism
government
integrity

war
assassination
terrorism
and
other
matter
whose
social
relevance
be
to
a
great
extent
beyond
the
boundary
of
commerce
and
finance
furthermore
lack
of
clarity
provide
a
disservice
to
the
platform
interested
in
list
the
contract
for
the
benefit
of
their
outside
lawyer
while
there
be
uncertainty
application
will
be
make
denied
and
only
law
firm
will
profit
while
client
lose
money
and
cftc
resource
be
exhaust
a
bright
line
rule
have
significant
advantage
over
product
by
product
determination
regard
the
term
game
I
agree
that
the
term
should
cover
the
staking
or
risk
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
I
the
outcome
of
a

iii
the

or

or
iv
any
other
occurrence

non

in

with

this
definition
should
be
clarify
to
include
other

such
as

who

whether

a

to

the

market
which
have
mechanism
for

distinguish

luck

in

these
contract
both
pose
moral
hazard
and
be
generally
unfit
for
market
list
due
to
low
value
from
a

or
price

perspective
and
high
likelihood
of
noisy
pricing
to
be
clear
while

on

should
be

over

could
be

there
be
a
line
drawing

but
the
cftc
should
not
put
itself
in
a
position
where
inquire
into
market
manipulation
be
synonymous
with
pursue
traditional

concern
investigate
a

in

how

in

factor
that

and
these

by

always
consider
whether
a

hedging
or

assess

at

it
replace
a

that
be

and
when

while
one
may
argue
the

refer
to
in
the

relate
to

as
a

in

without

as
background
economic
theory
draw
on
hayekian

sometimes
use
the

to
refer
simply
to
the
capacity
of

to
aggregate
information
about

through
the

form
through

under
this
definition
any

be
itself
valuable
as
an

of

many

that

without

however
price

in
this

be
foreign

this
be

with

be
clear
the

just

historically
the

commercial

turn

furthermore
this

give
the

and
derivative

participant
one
approach
would

to

where
part
of

be
return
after

demonstrate

these

could
both
deter

offset
the

on

it

either

neither

the

this
marketing
information

the

through

the

be
likely
to

to
do
this
in

case
so
as

the
cftc
can
leverage
exchange
access
to
customer
usage
information
towards
assess
hedge
utility
and
other
feature
of
interest
before
move
on
it
be
important
to
note
that
once
a
type
of
product
be
permit
for
gambling
or
other
personal
consumption
purpose
there
be
a
natural
demand
for
hedge
this
kind
of
bootstrappe
should
not
be
permit
for
example
once
a
number
of
state
legalize
sport
gambling
local
bookie
build
book
those
book
have
imbalance
exposure
due
to
among
other
reason
home
team
generally
be
overly
prefer
by
gambler
as
a
result
bookie
in
california
and
new
york
have
reason
to
offset
risk
through
swap
exposure
with
one
another
and
narrow
spread
indeed
this
be
the
theory
behind
the
three
contract
type
erisx
try
to
list
platform
legal
under
state
law
draft
king
fan
duel
caesar
however
should
not
be
able
to
always
turn
to
federally
regulate
derivative
market
for
hedge
commercial
exposure
for
this
reason
I
disagree
with
statement
from
ex
commissioner
berkovitz
on
the
erisx
certification
if
this
be
enable
there
would
be
no
limit
principle
for
example
if
a
state
or
foreign
jurisdiction
successfully
legalize
platform
where
wager
be
take
on
future
war
or
assassination
those
platform
would
have
hedge
need
but
should
federally
regulate
derivative
market
serve
those
need
I
think
the
answer
be
plainly
no
it
be
for
this
reason
that
gaming
and
a
number
of
other
item
be
carve
out
under
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
they
violate
federal
or
state
law
in
other
word
a
bona
fide
hedge
need
be
generally
a
necessary
but
insufficient
reason
for
approve
a
product
a
single
jurisdiction
legalize
wager
on
an
event
or
otherwise
permit
an
anti
social
activity
enable
a
good
faith
argument
that
there
be
a
hedge
need
in
relation
to
position
relate
to
that
activity
but
this
should
not
be
enough
for
product
approval
the
utility
of
a
product
for
hedging
or
price
discovery
purpose
be
not
the
only
consideration
that
be
relevant
in
the
course
of
a
public
interest
analysis
as
cftc
regulate
derivative
market
evolve
new
risk
need
to
be
consider
these
risk
will
vary
base
on
the
type
of
product
additional
consideration
may
include
concern
regard
moral
hazard
interference
with
state
police
power
the
competency
and
resource
of
the
cftc
the
jurisdiction
and
authority
of
the
cftc
public
perception
of
regulated
market
protect
market
participant
from
fraud
and
manipulation
as
well
as
other
matter
of
market
integrity
the
reliability
of
price
for
the
product
whether
relevant
information
be
available
only
to
a
few
individual
be
guard
as
secret
the
risk
of
corruption
or
perception
thereof
with
respect
to
public
and
private
body
and
other
matter
the
evolution
of
event
contract
product
pose
a
classic
case
of
where
law
struggle
to
keep
up
with
market
change
on
various
dimension
include
technology
scale
commercial
practice
and
cultural
attitude
to
financial
market
participation
have
prompt
product
that
challenge
assumption
the
cea
and
its
regulatory
framework
have
be
build
on
the
cftc
have
a
difficult
role
in
make
the
cea
fit
new
possibility
for
derivative
trade
a
rational
approach
to
regulation
build
on
information
and
enlist
the
assistance
and
input
of
interested
party
I
applaud
your
work
and
appreciate
the
difficult
decision
that
have
to
be
make
however
I
also
urge
you
to
invest
in
information
datum
and
descriptive
resource
to
help
make
derivative
market
and
their
regulation
more
accessible
I
understand
the
cftc
be
strained
for
resource
however
the
website
have
deficiency
that
make
it
difficult
for
researcher
such
as
myself
to
participate
in
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
process
or
otherwise
enrich
the
regulatory
environment
for
example
the
cftc
purport
to
list
previously
approve
and
self
certify
product
however
the
datum
the
cftc
provide
to
the
public
be
incomplete
among
other
thing
the
cftc
database
fail
to
include
documentation
for
many
of
the
contract
it
list
despite
having
receive
this
documentation
from
dcms
make
submission
while
it
would
take
work
on
the
part
of
the
cftc
to
complete
the
public
database
of
designate
contract
market
product
the
cftc
would
also
benefit
from
third
party
then
use
this
datum
to
study
derivative
market
and
inform
the
cftc
as
another
example
the
commitment
of
trader
datum
be
poorly
format
and
difficult
to
use
more
devastatingly
the
cftc
update
the
datum
on
a
weekly
basis
delete
past
datum
as
a
result
any
longitudinal
analysis
be
impossible
short
of
make
foia
request
for
the
datum
that
get
hide
every
week
when
new
datum
be
add
it
would
be
relatively
easy
for
the
cftc
to
provide
the
commitment
of
trader
datum
in
a
format
usable
in
statistical
analysis
package
and
to
make
historical
datum
available
in
other
word
help
well
mean
researcher
help
you
the
cftc
be
uniquely
position
to
gather
and
disseminate
information
on
derivative
market
contribute
not
only
to
transparency
but
fundamental
understanding
I
believe
these
kind
of
investment
be
worth
it
and
in
addition
to
provide
datum
the
cftc
would
do
well
to
engage
in
concept
release
that
revisit
and
organize
think
on
core
issue
inform
derivative
market
regulation
I
would
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
at
to
discuss
these
and
relate
matter
far
whether
via
set
up
a
call

discuss
in

I
below
this
enable
the
management
of
risk
and
establishment
of
price
with
respect
to
transaction
in
wheat
all
over
the
part
infra
for
example
a
farmer
could
go
short
through
the
future
contract
sell
the
grain
under
the
contract
to
neutralize
her
risk
that
grain
price
fluctuate
through
sell
wheat
under
the
future
contract
the
farmer
sell
at
today
price
with
settlement
take
place
in
the
future
through
an
exchange
of
the
reference
commodity
for
cash
if
price
for
wheat
increase
the
farmer
will
I
lose
money
under
the
future
contract
because
the
price
of
wheat
at
the
time
of
delivery
under
the
future
contract
exceed
what
she
sell
it
for
but
ii
experience
increase
revenue
from
the
harvest
if
on
the
other
hand
price
fall
the
farmer
will
I
profit
under
the
future
contract
and
b
suffer
offset
loss
as
she
sell
her
harvest
at
the
low
price
a
bakery
can
similarly
use
grain
future
to
guard
against
price
fluctuation
the
bakery
would
go
long
through
the
future
contract
buy
the
grain
this
would
mean
that
if
wheat
price
decline
the
bakery
lose
under
the
future
contract
but
be
able
to
procure
its
ingredient
at
a
low
cost
and
reciprocally
if
grain
price
increase
the
value
of
the
bakery
future
position
increase
although
its
procurement
cost

these
example
of
a

if

this

entail

for

and
the

these
type
of

there

these

the

that
the
cpi
track
be
extraordinarily
broad
and
as
with

initial
freight

it
be
unlikely
that
any
market
participant
will
be
expose
to
the
change
it
track
with
any
specificity
moreover
the
cash

be
incomplete
as
there
be
no
ability
to
short
component
of
the

such
as
housing
cost
and
grocery
that
be
not
to
say
that
cpi

can
not
be
use
to
hedge
they
can
albeit
only
for
the
relatively
short

period
for
which
future
be
available
however
the
multicomponent
nature
of
the

aggravate
basis
risk
a

cbot
wheat

know
roughly
the
relationship
between
her
wheat
price
and
the
price
of
the
wheat
underlie
the
cbot
contract
however
an
exporter
use
biffex
contract
to
hedge
a
few
specific
route
carry
substantial
basis
risk
that
the
index
price
change
due
to
price
of

that
be
irrelevant
to
the
shipper
similarly
someone
purchase
a
cpi

may
find
that
the
cpi
change
due
to
change
in
the
cost
of
service
or
good
the
hedger
do
usually
use
this
be
an
important
point
it
may
be
that
the
hedger
housing

evolve
differently
from
the
housing
or

reflect
in
the

multicomponent

however
raise
a
distinct
type
of
noncorrelation
it
may
be
that
the

include
expenditure
that
the
hedger
simply
do
not
make
such
as
car
relate
expense
where
the
hedger
live
in

and
rely

this

may

an

alternatively

demonstrate
both
a

they
the
prototypical
farmer
could
use
traditional
grain
future
to
hedge
against
fluctuation
in
the
price
of
grain
for
example
at
the
time
of
plant
the
farmer
could
enter
into
a
contract
to
deliver
bushel
in

september
or
december
follow
the
summer
the
farmer
would
be
pay
base
on
current
price
of
wheat
when
sell
those
future
in
exchange
the
farmer
would
deliver
the
wheat
in

of
sell
it
at
september
or

price
or
alternatively
offset
the
future
obligation
through
buy
inverse
future
at
the
time
of

and
then
deliver
her
grain
to
the
market
base
somewhat
on
the
price
of
the
offset
future
this
enable
the
farmer
to
shed
price
risk
but
this

do
nothing
about
yield

or
the

uncertainty
as
to
the
volume
of
her

how
could
the
farmer
know
when
plant
how
many
bushel
of
wheat
she
would
have
to
sell
if
she
use
her
historical

she
may

in

or
remain
partly

in

to

the

committee
the

the

and
staff
at

cftc
all
have
personal
reason
to
grow
the
cftc
jurisdiction
through
expand
the
range
of
regulate
instrument
moreover
growth
into
area
traditionally
regulate
solely
under

as
oppose
to

within

allow
the

to

away
from

a
third
story
be

in

the
fact
that

I
believe
possibly
under
an
exemption
for

a

of
sophisticated
person
many
of
these
contract
reproduce

already
be
trade
on
cbot
or

subject
to
one
alteration
instead
of
transfer
the
magnitude
of
risk
as
commonly
do
through
future
the
hedgestreet
product
transfer
risk
in
a
binary
manner
for
example
these
product
although
purportedly
design
for
hedging
do
not
distinguish
between
a
crop
yield
fall
short
of
a
threshold
by
a
little
or
an

than

and
an
unprecedented
hurricane
season
that
lead
to

among

or
c
a

of

market
that
trigger
the
threshold
and
a
massive
loss
of
job
due
to
an
unprecedent
pandemic
such
as
covid19
the
hedgestreet
product
be
by
design
crudely
binary
and
aim
at
retail
trader
while
it
be
difficult
to
say
that
the
product
lack
hedge
utility
they
be
far
from
as
tailor
in
how
they
transfer
risk
than
preexist
product
be
although
it
transfer
risk
in
a
crude
fashion
the
hedgestreet
product
model
do
have
a
justification
traditional
future
which
expose
market
participant
to
continuous
range
of
risk
require
margine
the
same
be
generally
true
of
swap
and
the
sale
as
oppose
to
the
purchase
of
non
binary
option
margine
among
other
thing
require
party
to
a
future
transaction
to
post
or
receive
collateral
on
a
daily
basis
see
24
supra
and
surround
text
the
follow
example
illustrate
the
relevance
of
margine
to
traditional
future
as
distinct
from
event
contract
in
the
form
of
binary
option
consider
a
future
contract
on
the
price
of
grain
if
the
future
contract
be
execute
at
current
market
price
of
grain
for
settlement
in
two
month
time
each
party
be
expose
to
a
continuous
range
of
risk
the
party
that
sell
the
grain
be
subject
to
the
risk
that
the
price
increase
the
price
could
theoretically
increase
to
infinity
so
there
be
no
upper
bind
on
the
seller
exposure
no
amount
of
prepayment
would
be
sufficient
and
instead
derivative
market
have
traditionally
require
the
posting
of
variation
margin
to
cover
increase
in
price
as
they
occur
the
long
position
be
distinct
but
also
expose
to
a
continuous
range
of
risk
price
can
decline
which
result
in
loss
to
the
purchaser
up
to
a
maximum
where
price
reach
zero
and
the
purchaser
loss
converge
to
the
price
at
execution
for
every
cent
the
price
of
reference
grain
decline
the
purchaser
of
the
future
lose
a
cent
there
be
precedent
for
price
fall
below
zero
such
as
when
during
the
covid19
pandemic
oil
purchaser
be
pay
to
take
barrel
of
oil
because
storage
capacity

although
a
purchaser
could
prepay
for
all
potential
loss
on
the
future
by
initially
deposit
an
amount
that
would
be
deliverable
if
price
reach
zero
for
efficiency
because
price
rarely
fall
so
much
and
the
additional
capital
cost
on
future
purchaser
would
deter
trading
that
historically
have
not
be
do
risk
management
generally
do
not
seek
to
eliminate
risk
but
to
adequately
mitigate

instead
purchaser
like
seller
post
variation
margin
as
price
change
to
continue
the
example
consider
two
binary
option
instead
of
a
future
contract
the
first
binary
option
pay
100
if
the
price
of
grain
be
below
6
bushel
at
the
time
of
settlement
the
second
binary
option
pay
100
if
the
price
of
grain
be
equal
to
or
above
6
bushel
at
the
time
of
settlement
these
binary
option
can
be
fully
prepay
with
a
payment
of
100
plus
any
transaction
fee
this
be
the
structure
that
iem
develop
which
be
discuss
above
and
this
structure
do
not
require
margine
over
the
lifetime
of
the
trade
because
no
party
to
the
option
contract
can
incur
any
additional
liability
over
its
lifetime
the
maximum
payable
under
both
option
be
100
which
be
pay
at
the
outset
be
responsive
to
margin
call
on
a
daily
basis
as
future
require
be
expensive
and
not
something
retail
and
other
small
trader
can
generally
support
that
be
why
from
an
administrative
or
operational
perspective
binary
option
be
well
suit
to
retail
participant
the
cost
of
calculate
obtain
transfer
and
custodye
collateral
be
avoid
make
the
product
cheap
to
supportboth
for
trader
and
intermediary
and
as
already
explain
binary
option
can
be
use
to
hedge
but
in
a
far
more
limited
way
than
the
future
contract
when
a
farmer
buy
option
that
pay
if
price
go
below
6
bushel
and
sell
option
that
pay
if
price
be
at
or
above
6
bushel
the
farmer
do
obtain
a
limited
hedge
the
farmer
make
money
from
her
harvest
if
price
increase
and
make
money
from
the
option
if
price
decrease
below
6
however
while
the
amount
she
lose
on
her
harvest
fall
continuously
as
price
approach
0
per
bushel
the
amount
she
receive
as
compensation
on
the
option
do
not
change
the
payout
be
the
same
whether
price
be
at
5
bushel
or
1
bushel
at
the
cost
of
additional
transaction
fee
the
farmer
could
use
binary
option
to
well
approximate
the
continuous
price
risk
she
face
on
her
harvest
this
could
be
do
through
purchase
additional
option
that
pay
if
price
go
low
for
example
one
option
that
pay
if
price
fall
below
6
bushel
another
option
that
pay
if
price
fall
below
bushel
another
option
that
pay
if
price
fall
below
5
bushel
and
so
on
in
practice
however
these
strategy
tend
to
be
impractical
because
fee
on
transaction
be
high
and
the
distinct
strike
price
at
which
contract
be
available
be
relatively
far
from
each
other
the
price
risk
between
wheat
selling
at
6
bushel
and
bushel
be
significant
this
make
the
hedge
relatively
crude
but
a
crude
hedge
may
be
well
than
no
hedge
if
a
trader
can
access
traditional
product
as
be
the
case
for
many
retail
participant
if
product
such
as
those
develop
by
hedgestreet
can
be
justify
from
a
customer
perspective
this
be
generally
how
they
would
be
justify
they
offer
hedge
opportunity
where
practical
alternative
do
not
exist
market
base
pricing
as
a
philosophy
of
social
coordination
reach
an
apotheosis
in
the
handful
of
year
prior
to
the
financial
crisis
of
2008
as
a

away
from

about
the

relatively

in

the

trace

path
that

lead
to
many

be
authorize
despite
have
scant
if
any
connection
to
the
goal
of

the
cftc
have
ignore
its

long

drift
the

should
undertake
a
review
of

to
delist
those
that
have
only
attenuate

to
the

in

this

continue

primarily
in

first
it
empirically
trace
the

second
as

the

reason
for

protection
be
review
in

if
the

be
insufficient
to

that
fail
to

as
provide
under

hereof
the
rest
of
this
part
iii
consider
interpretive
and
policy
argument
against
this

proposal
that
the
cftc
relinquish
control
over
product
with
limited
hedging
and
price
utility
so
that
they
return
to

these
argument
stem
from
a
distinct
predictive
function
of
financial
product
which
the
iem
and
subsequent
prediction
market
develop
before
turn
to
the
legal
and

a

for
the
power
of

to

as
cass

observe
in
2006
deliberation
be
one
way
to
aggregate
privately
hold
information
but
there
be
many
other
possibility
an
obvious
alternative
be
to
rely
on
the
price
signal
which
have
a
similar
aggregative
function
as
hayek
emphasize
the
price
mechanism
be
a
kind
of
marvel
because
it
combine
widely
disperse
information

by
diverse
people
and
if
an
emphasis
be
place
on
the

property
of

it
would
seem
plain
that
to

that
when

the

a

there

the

the
