many
issue
raise
in
the
proposal
relevant
to
gaming
or
the
sport
bet
industry
be
not
novel
to
our
ongoing
dialogue
with
the
commission
since
december
2018
we
have
engage
in
thoughtful
discussion
with
the
cftc
and
its

potential
concern
on
these

have
provide

continue
with

hope
that
we
can
find
the
solution
that
serve
both
the
public

and
the
legal
sport

market
industry
interest
we
hope
that
this
comment
letter
further
that
purpose
contract
involve
gaming
be
not
categorically
contrary
to
public
interest
nowhere
in
the
cea
include
in
the
dodd
frank
provision
relate
to
event
contract
in
section
be
it
state
that
contract
involve
the
enumerate
activity
be
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
statute
do
not
establish
a
blanket
prohibition
on
contract
involve
gaming
recognize
that
not
all
such
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
view
be
support
by
commissioner
mersinger
dissent
statement
which
state
the
proposal
would
allow
the
commission
to
make
the
substantive
policy
determination
that
entire
category
of
event
contract
regardless
of
their
term
and
condition
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
consequence
of
such
a
determination
be
severe
a
complete
prohibition
on
exchange
ability
to
list
event
contract
and
on
market
participant
ability
to
trade
they
if
congress
have
intend
for
the
commission
to
wield
this
immense
authority
surely
it
would
have
say
so
similarly
we
cite
former
sec
general
counsel
cftc
general
counsel
and
former
cftc
commissioner
dan
berkovitz
statement
relate
to
review
of
erisx
certification
of
nfl
future
contract
in
which
he
state
the
follow
notably
however
the
cea
gaming
provision
do
not
require
the
commission
to
prohibit
contract
involve
gaming
or
to
prohibit
a
contract
simply
because
it
involve
game
it
provide
the
commission
with
the
discretion
to
prohibit
they
in
my
view
the
commission
should
recognize
the
significant
growth
of
sport
bet
as
a
legalized
activity
in
recent
year
with
significant
underlying
commercial
activity
the
commission
should
permit
a
dcm
to
list
contract
involve
sport
event
where
a
dcm
demonstrate
that
such
contract
have
an
economic
purpose
and
hedge
utility
relate
to
such
commercial
activity
because
in
many
state
sport
betting
be
now
legal
under
both
state
and
federal
law
it
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
the
commission
to
permit
the
listing
of
sport
event
contract
if
an
exchange
can
demonstrate
that
the
contract
will
be
use
to
hedge
commercial
risk
arise
from
lawful
commercial
activity
relate
to
sport
bet
it
should
be
note
that
commissioner
berkovitz
comment
be
publish
in
april
2021
when
only
25
state
plus
the
district
of
columbia
have
legalize
sport
bet
many
of
which
be
in
only
their
first
or
second
year
of
have
operational
market
the
industry
have
significantly
mature
in
the
meantime
much
of
which
we
touch
upon
through
this
comment
letter
cea

grant
the
commission
discretion
to
prohibit
an
event
contract
from

if
the

involve
one
of

or
v
2
if
the
commission
determine
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to

the
same
cea

also
provide
the

by

the
discretion
to
determine
that
an

involve
other
similar
activity
to
the

the

for
any
such

that
the

determine

reference
in
the
proposal
among
other
thing
fold
the
two
distinct
discretionary
determination
of
cea
section
into
one
by
the
mere
fact
of
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
such
an
event
contract
be
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
on
its
face
we
take
this
to
mean
that
the
enumerate
activity
themselves
be
in
some
sense
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
interpretation
go
beyond
the
statutory
text
even
if
the
enumerate
activity
list
demonstrate
congressional
intent
to
empower
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contract
that
would
effectively
serve
as
a
wagering
vehicle
subject
to
a
commission
determination
that
such
contract
be
contrary
to
public
interest
as
the
commission
state
that
do
not
support
a
blanket
prohibition
of
all
contract
involve
gaming
however
define
the
statute
itself
recognize
that
not
all
such
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
require
a
separate
determination
additionally
one
of
these
five
enumerate
activity
be
not
like
the
other
and
the
other
be
all
markedly
like
each
other
among
the
five
enumerate
activity
gaming
be
the
only
activity
that
currently
have
a
widespread
legal
and
regulated
industry
in
many
jurisdiction
whether
on
a
nationwide
or
international
level
and
which
a
enjoy
a
high
degree
of
participation
among
americans
the
other
item
on
the
list
be
either
strictly
illegal
like
assassination
and
terrorism
or
in
the
case
of
war
not
a
commercial
industry
in
the
conventional
sense
of
the
term
all
three
pertain
to
some
form
of
political
violence
which
be
universally
abhor
additionally
we
consider
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
to
be
a
purposeful
mean
of
ensure
that
the
commission
have
the
discretion
to
prohibit
an
event
contract
involve
activity
either
not
worthy
of
explicit
consideration
by
congress
or
not
within
the
present
or
future
consideration
of
congress
at
the
time
of
write
the
item
on
this
list
create
in
2010
illustrate
the
congressional
intent
to
ensure
market
would
not
be
use
to
facilitate
or
promote
illegal
activity
the
inclusion
of
gaming
as
an
enumerate
activity
in
this
list
be
thus
a
relic
of
time
bury
by
legal
development
in
the
form
of
widespread
legalization
and
regulation
of
game
the
commission
interpret
game
activity
presence
on
the
enumerate
activity
list
as
congressional
intent
to
empower
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contract
that
would
effectively
serve
as
a
wagering
vehicle
subject
to
a
commission
determination
that
such
contract
be
contrary
to
public
interest
because
gaming
be
identify
as
an
enumerate
activity
separate
and
apart
from
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
footnote

of
the
proposal
in
so
do
the
commission
rely
on
a
2010
colloquy
between
the
late
senator
diane
feinstein
and
senator
blanche
lincoln
regard
the
propose
dodd
frank
act
provision
that
ultimately
be
enact
as
cea
section
commission
need
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivative
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
suppose
event
contract
ibid
with
respect
to
gaming
be
include
separate
and
apart
from
activity
illegal
under
any
federal
or
state
law
we
believe
that
this
distinction
likely
reflect
congress
intent
to
make
its
specific
concern
explicit
for
instance
terrorism
be
by
definition
illegal
and
so
could
have
just
as
easily
fall
under
the
umbrella
of
an
activity
illegal
under
federal
or
state
law
nevertheless
congress
include
it
as
an
enumerate
activity
in
order
to
necessitate
that
the
commission
evaluate
any
contract
involve
terrorism
accord
to
the
public
interest
standard
and
to
make
its
specific
concern
with
respect
to
terrorism
evident
we
concur
with
commissioner
mersinger
sentiment
express
in
her
dissent
statement
on
the
proposal
I
admit
that
I
be
not
go
to
lose
sleep
over
a
determination
that
all
event
contract
involve
terrorism
assassination
and
war
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
similar
analysis
can
be
extend
to
assassination
and
war
as
well
by
include
gaming
as
an
enumerate
activity
congress
intend
to
make
its
concern
clear
regard
gaming
involve
contract
qua
a
broadly
illegal
and
federally
ban
activity
at
the
time
dodd
frank
act
be
pass
the
colloquy
provide
evidence
of
this
both
in
form
and
substance
as
a
matter
of
substance
congress
mandate
the
commission
exercise
discretion
to
evaluate
gaming
relate
contract
accord
to
the
public
interest
standard
rather
than
mandate
blanket
prohibition
precisely
because
such
contract
could
predominantly
function
to
inappropriately
enable
gaming
at
the
time
when
gaming
be
broadly
illegal
and
sport
betting
be
ban
from
be
legalize
in
any
state
where
it
be
not
already
legal
in
46
out
of

state
delaware
nevada
oregon
and
montana
be
exempt
from
part
of

delaware
oregon
and
montana
host
sport
lottery
permit
sport
pool
rather
than
sport
bet
in
the
typical
sense
of
the
term
but
that
function
be
long
the
potentially
predominant
one
we
agree
with
the
commission
that
the
cite
colloquy
sentence
be
particularly
instructive
as
a
matter
of
determine
intent
but
we
respectfully
believe
that
deep
analysis
lead
to
a
different
implication
than
the
commission
own
the
2010
colloquy
occur
in
a
vastly
different
legal
landscape
with
respect
to
gaming
and
sport
bet
when
the
professional
and
amateur
sport
protection
act
paspa
ban
state
from
legalize
sport
bet
with
nevada
be
the
primary
exception
we
respectfully
correct
the
commission
statement
that
there
be
casino
sportsbook
in
new
jersey
when
cea
section
be
enact
paspa
be
at
issue
before
the
supreme
court
in
murphy
national
collegiate
athletic
association
2018
because
new
jersey
attempt
to
legalize
sport
betting
have
legalize
sportsbook
casino
include
in
this
context
the
capacity
for
derivative
contract
to
predominantly
function
as
a
means
to
enable
gaming
rather
than
as
legitimate
hedging
tool
be
significantly
heighten
due
to
the
extremely
limited
legal
sport
bet
industry
this
be
so
in
two
immediate
respect
first
the
want
of
a
legal
hedging
mechanism
for
the
sport
bet
industry
be
minor
relative
to
today
precisely
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
sportsbook
operation
which
be
confine
to
nevada
as
a
result
sportsbook
operator
which
themselves
be
casino
face
less
absolute
exposure
and
risk
from
the
outcome
of
sporting
event
second
that
only
nevada
hold
legal
sport
bet
market
mean
that
most
prospective
bettor
be
unable
to
place
legal
bet
in
their
resident
state
leave
they
want
for
some
legal
mean
to
do
so
like
a
derivative
market
existent
only
predominantly
to
enable
game
the
use
of
the
phrase
predominantly
to
enable
gaming
be
especially
noteworthy
in
the
colloquy
it
imply
facilitate
an
activity
that
face
substantial
barrier
or
impediment
in
this
case
the
near
universal
prohibition
of
sport
bet
under
paspa
now
the
premise
underlie
the
2010
statement
have
be
fundamentally
alter
such
impediment
be
no
long
the
sport
bet
industry
now
in
its
sixth
year
of
legal
existence
have
evolve
into
a
robust
economic
sector
with
legitimate
risk
management
need
and
a
wealth
of
consumer
across
nearly
40
state
on
this
latter
point
we
cite
an
illustrative
example
by
the
american
gaming
association
aga
who
report
that
a
record
million
american
adult
26
be
expect
to
bet
on
super
bowl
lviii
a
35
percent
increase
from
2023
further
statistic
show
that
million
american
adult
plan
to
place
a
traditional
sport
wager
online
at
a
retail
sportsbook
or
with
a
bookie
up
41
percent
from
2023
and
that
million
adult
or
11
percent
intend
to
place
online
wager
use
a
legal
sportsbook
ibid
in
this
new
context
there
be
scant
functional
need
for
derivative
market
that
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gaming
because
gaming
or
sport
betting
be
now
widespread
and
legally
accessible
in
most
state
even
still
those
who
do
not
have
access
to
legal
market
in
their
resident
state
readily
find
illegal
offshore
online
platform
through
which
they
can
wager
on
sport
but
which
do
not
offer
they
or
their
state
any
of
the
protection
or
benefit
of
a
regulated
platform
advertisement
for
offshore
online
bookie
abound
on
the
internet
and
be
often
intersperse
among
advertisement
for
legal
and
regulated
sportsbook
with
no
evident
distinction
between
the
legal
status
of
the
two
platform
this
be
an
issue
that
the
legal
sport
bet
industry
have
be
combat
crucially
the
causal
relationship
express
in
the
statement
that
potential
contract
may
exist
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
warrant
careful
examination
the
function
of
predominantly
enable
gaming
be
the
very
reason
these
contract
be
deem
contrary
to
the
public
interest
however
today
this
potential
function
be
completely
vestigial
if
the
primary
reason
for
these
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
no
long
relevant
with
broad
legalization
and
regulation
of
sport
bet
in
most
state
and
illegal
offshore
online
platform
illicitly
enable
gaming
in
the
other
to
the
detriment
of
those
state
and
their
resident
it
follow
that
the
event
contract
be
no
long
contrary
to
the
public
interest
on
these
ground
the
entire
gaming
landscape
have
change
there
be
no
need
for
event
contract
to
exist
to
predominantly
enable
gaming
because
gaming
be
already
broadly
accessible
now
the
predominant
function
of
such
event
contract
would
be
to
serve
legitimate
hedging
purpose
for
the
sport
bet
industry
such
that
they
can
well
manage
their
financial
risk
and
stay
competitive
with
the
illegal
offshore
bookmaker
who
predate
on
american
citizen
both
purpose
protect
the
interest
of
american
citizen
and
the
state
in
which
they
live
and
therefore
the
public
interest
we
respectfully
urge
the
commission
to
consider
the
current
economic
and
legal
reality
of
the
gaming
industry
rather
than
the
sentiment
of
a
restrictive
legal
landscape
that
more
than
a
supermajority
of
state
have
displace
while
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
prohibit
certain
gaming
relate
contract
that
it
determine
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
authority
do
not
extend
to
a
blanket
prohibition
the
text
of
the
statute
the
statement
of
current
and
former
commissioner
the
change
legal
landscape
and
the
legitimate
economic
purpose
of
such
contract
all
support
a
more
nuanced
approach
that
consider
each
contract
on
its
merit
ii
the
sport
bet
industry
need
hedging
tool
the
commission
offer
in
its
proposal
two
statement
address
the
potential
for
event
contract
involve
gaming
to
be
use
as
legitimate
hedging
tool
both
with
which
we
contend
below
1
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
other
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
include
the
outcome
of
such
a
contest
or
game
generally
be
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
change
in
the
price
of
commodity
or
other
financial
asset
or
instrument
limit
the
hedging
and
price
base
utility
of
an
event
contract
involve
such
an
occurrence
2
that
the
commission
believe
that
contract
involve
such
occurrence
be
likely
to
be
trade
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
use
predominantly
by
speculator
or
participant
not
have
a
commercial
or
hedge
interest
and
can
not
reasonably
expect
to
be
use
for
hedge
price
base
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
commission
both
evidence
and
industry
member
have

allow

regardless

there

this

be

one
sportsbook
frequently
encounter
situation
where
there
a
disproportionate

occur
the

popular
side
and

this
may

bill
fan
the
majority
of
whom
be
presumably
in

would
rarely
consider
bet
against

especially
on

home
game
and
the
same
could
be
say
for
fan
of
the
giant
or
jet
for
these
game
the
sportsbook
must
either
operate
with
an
imbalance
book
or
offer
unattractive
odd
in
an
attempt
to
artificially
balance
it
attempt
which
be
rarely
successful
as
fan
be
more
likely
to
turn
to
another
platform
or
forego
the
bet
altogether
this
imbalance
be
readily
perceptible
and
easily
identify
as
exposure
to
the
outcome
of
the
sporting
event
because
if
the
bill
win
the
sportsbook
may
not
have
enough
money
on
the
other
side
to
cover
the
winning
more
attractive
odd
be
generally
insufficient
to
induce
fan
to

there

in

versus

she
note
that
the

rationale
for
deem
these

contrary

the

she

that

that

in

for

gain
and
yet
future

in
these
sector
be
permit
and
widely
trade
the
commissioner
rightly
question
this
inconsistency
point
out
that
while
an
event
contract
allow
player
or
coach
to
trade
would
indeed
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
proposal
overreach
by
conclude
that
such
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
even
when
their
term
and
condition
explicitly
prohibit
these
individual
from
trade
it
be
already
standard
practice
in
the
sport
bet
industry
to
prohibit
player
coach
and
other
potential
insider
from
wager
on
their
own
sport
this
prohibition
be
typically
enforce
through
league
policy
state
regulation
and
sportsbook
own
term
of
service
demonstrate
that
such
restriction
be
both
feasible
and
effective
in
maintain
market
integrity
company
such
as
us
integrity
play
an
integral
role
in
enforce
this
practice
this
stance
seem
to
disregard
the
effectiveness
of
contractual
prohibition
and
regulatory
oversight
that
be
common
practice
in
other
future
market
and
apply
a
different
standard
to
sport
event
contract
without
clear
justification
this
comparison
underscore
a
critical
flaw
in
the
proposal
reason
it
overlook
the
fact
that
the
regulate
sport
bet
industry
like
traditional
future
market
have
develop
robust
mechanism
to
detect
and
prevent
market
manipulation
as
we
show
the
collaboration
between
sportsbook
integrity
monitoring
service
and
regulatory
body
have
create
a
vigilant
ecosystem
capable
of
quickly
identify
investigate

suspicious

give
the
statistical

we
present
on
the
low
incidence
of
suspicious

in
sport

and
the
industry
demonstrate
ability
to
self
regulate
effectively
we
contend
that
sport

should
be
evaluate
use
the
same
nuanced
approach
as
other
future

the
regulate
sport
bet
industry
ability
to
effectively
monitor
and
address
integrity
concern
couple
with
the
statistical
evidence
of
low
incidence
of
suspicious
activity
demonstrate
that
event
contract
on
sporting
event
do
not
pose
a
unique
or
outsized
risk
to
market
integrity
moreover
these
contract
serve
the
public
interest
by
enhance
the
competitiveness
and
risk
management
capability
of
regulated
operator
especially
in
their
fight
against
the
offshore
industry
all
of
which
in
turn
strengthen
consumer
protection
and
contribute
to
state
economy
we
respectfully
urge
the
commission
to
consider
the
robust
safeguard
already
in
place
within
the
sport
bet
ecosystem
the
public
interest
benefit
of
a
well
regulate
industry
and
to
approach
the
evaluation
of
sport
event
contract
with
the
same
nuanced
perspective
apply
to
other
future
market
iv
conclusion
the
sport
bet
landscape
in
the
united
states
have
undergo
a
seismic
shift
since
the
enactment
of
cea
section
in
2010
what

that

through
consumer
protection
economic
contribution
and
integrity
safeguard
the
commission
proposal
to
categorically
prohibit
event
contract
involve
gaming
however
define
fail
to
account
for
these
fundamental
change
and
overlook
the
legitimate
hedge
need
of
industry
participant
we
respectfully
urge
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
approach
to
event
contract
involve
sporting
event
outcome
and
game
more
broadly
the
text
of
the
cea
do
not
mandate
a
blanket
prohibition
and
such
a
sweeping
measure
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
seek
to
protect
in
the
context
