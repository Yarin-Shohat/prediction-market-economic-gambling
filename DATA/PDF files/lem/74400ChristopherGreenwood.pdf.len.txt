the
proposal
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
have
provide
several
question
regard
the
proposal
that
relate
in
large
part
to
the
public
interest
as
a
longstanding
market
maker
of
exchange
trade
derivative
instrument
we
believe
that
the
public
interest
would
be
very
much
serve
by
the
exchange
provide
a
regulated
market
to
trade
the
contract
in
the
propose
manner
the
reason
support
our
view
be
provide
below
as
an
initial
matter
several
of
the
cftc
question
regard
the
potential
listing
of
the
contract
relate
to
whether
the
contract
constitute
gaming
as
reference
in
cftc
rule
while
we
defer
to
the
argument
submit
by
the
exchange
and
legal
expert
on
this
issue
we
would
note
that
our
understanding
of
gaming
be
that
it
involve
an
activity
wherein
a
person
typically
a
gambler
a
casino
or
a
sportsbook
take
on
financial
risk
as
an
inherent
part
of
the
person
gamble
operation
and
unrelated
to
any
other
business
activity
by
contrast
the
contract
at
issue
offer
genuine
hedge
opportunity
by
provide
person
typically
business
involve
in
industry
unrelated
to
gamble
a
financial
market
solution
to
alleviate
financial
risk
and
uncertainty
arise
outside
of
their
day
to
day
operation
by
trade
that
risk
with
a
third
party
without
otherwise
affect
those
day
to
day
business
operation
the
value
of
a
derivative
product
stem
largely
from
its
ability
to
offer
a
hedge
against
unwanted
risk
when
a
regulated
derivate
market
make
such
a
product
available
the
public
generally
benefit
in
this
case
the
listing
of
the
contract
provide
significant
direct
and
indirect
benefit
to
the
public
as
it
offer
the
most
efficient
method
of
hedge
the
numerous
risk
associate
with
one
party
win
control
of
congress
instead
of
another
the
most
efficient
method
of
hedge
the
numerous
risk
associate
with
one
party
win
control
of
congress
instead
of
another
as
other
commentor
have
explain
market
participant
already
regularly
adjust
their
trading
strategy
in
response
to
electoral
outcome
as
different
government
have
substantially
different
policy
while
there
be
some
uncertainty
regard
the
exact
manifestation
of
specific
policy
the
contract
allow
a
market
participant
and
the
market
as
a
whole
to
forecast
the
implication
associate
with
one
party
political
agenda
and
then
react
to
the
possible
outcome
of
an
election
indeed
the
directional
effect
of
a
give
government
on
commodity
and
security
price
can
be
and
be
predict
for
example
one
political
party
with
a
majority
control
of
congress
may
be
more
likely
than
another
to
impose
either
more
strict
or
more
lenient
environmental
regulation
that
would
respectively
raise
or
reduce
operational
cost
associate
with
certain
energy
industry
if
the
risk
of
increase
regulatory
cost
be
great
enough
business
and
supplier
in
the
energy
sector
could
alleviate
the
potential
cost
increase
by
trade
a
contract
with
a
party
more
willing
to
bear
that
risk
similarly
a
give
political
party
may
be
more
or
less
likely
to
approve
new
expenditure
such
as
infrastructure
project
than
another
market
participant
rely
upon
congressional
spending
in
that
sector
could
use
the
contract
to
hedge
the
risk
of
gain
or
lose
this
anticipated
source
of
funding
plainly
change
in
government
result
in
myriad
regulatory
consequence
which
in
turn
pose
a
quantifiable
risk
to
many
different
market
participant
our
experience
over
decade
in
the
financial
industry
suggest
that
traditional
instrument
be
insufficient
to
fully
hedge
the
risk
that
arise
from
these
fluctuation
in
federal
policy
many
product
do
not
have
future
market
associate
with
they
for
example
in
the
agriculture
space
most
fruit
and
vegetable
do
not
have
a
future
market
as
such
market
participant
that
face
idiosyncratic
policy
risk
be
force
to
use
imperfect
exchange
trade
product
that
do
not
fully
reduce
their
unwanted
risk
the
contract
on
the
other
hand
can
be
use
to
efficiently
hedge
business
risk
in
the
same
manner
as
other
successfully
list
hedge
product
that
be
once
the
excess
business
risk
associate
with
one
party
political
agenda
have
be
identify
by
the
customer
it
can
be
efficiently
transfer
to
another
party
more
willing
and
able
to
manage
the
risk
indeed
when
a
farmer
use
a
list
future
to
hedge
a
crop
harvest
or
a
financial
institution
use
a
list
future
to
hedge
a
portfolio
of
investment
product
the
same
general
risk
management
goal
apply
to
those
instance
as
it
would
to
a
business
that
will
hedge
use
the
contract
on
the
exchange
the
ability
to
hedge
risk
also
enable
market
participant
to
operate
steady
business
for
instance
a
public
work
contractor
concern
about
the
above
hypothetical
change
in
infrastructure
spending
could
alleviate
that
risk
and
for
example
potentially
avoid
preemptive
layoff
the
availability
of
the
contract
on
the
exchange
likely
have
an
equally
beneficial
impact
on
broad
financial
market
specifically
because
election
result
already
influence
the
way
that
market
participant
trade
the
price
of
certain
commodity
and
security
necessarily
react
to
an
anticipated
election
result
as
well
as
such
we
believe
that
by
allow
market
participant
to
trade
position
on
upcoming
election
the
market
will
naturally
and
efficiently
determine
the
most
accurate
underlying
price
associate
with
one
party
win
over
another
these
price
in
turn
provide
the
most
accurate
indicator
of
the
outcome
of
the
upcoming
election
market
participant
likely
react
to
that
datum
and
the
market
adjust
the
price
of
commodity
and
security
that
would
be
impact
by
the
election
accordingly
thus
while
no
specific
outcome
may
be
guarantee
the
availability
of
this
datum
often
result
in
more
efficiently
price
commodity
and
security
for
consumer
while
allow
for
less
fluctuation
and
speculation
state
differently
by
allow
market
participant
to
trade
on
the
outcome
of
election
the
actual
outcome
of
those
election
would
have
a
minimized
impact
on
the
volatility
of
the
market
as
a
whole
because
that
outcome
will
be
price
in
the
result
predictability
of
price
benefit
both
market
participant
and
the
general
public
the
final
set
of
question
pose
by
the
cftc
with
respect
to
the
contract
concern
whether
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
while
many
other
commenter
have
weigh
in
regard
the
social
significance
of
these
contract
hedge
utility
and
their
resistance
to
market
manipulation
sig
would
emphasize
the
importance
of
bring
this
valuable
activity
under
a
us
base
regulatory
framework
vast
amount
of
election
relate
trading
already
occur
in
the
status
quo
often
on
unregulated
platform
that
do
not
have
the
robust
oversight
and
protection
that
american
consumer
have
come
to
expect
or
on
other
overseas
market
this
fact
should
not
only
highlight
the
clear
demand
that
exist
for
these
product
but
also
underscore
the
benefit
to
citizen
and
business
by
bring
this
activity
to
the
onshore
regulated
and
tax
market
approval
of
the
contract
and
the
result
ability
for
market
participant
to
manage
their
own
risk
in
a
regulated
environment
would
provide
much
need
market
protection
for
the
many
that
already
avail
themselves
of
these
hedging
tool
in
conclusion
sig
strongly
support
the
cftc
approval
of
the
listing
of
the
contract
and
believe
that
the
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
as
they
be
an
innovative
product
that
provide
an
active
competitive
hedge
market
to
the
benefit
of
a
multitude
of
stakeholder
