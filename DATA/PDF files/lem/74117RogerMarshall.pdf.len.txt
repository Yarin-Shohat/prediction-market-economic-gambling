dear
chairman
behnam
we
write
to
express
concern
regard
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
commission
consideration
of
a
rulemaking
proposal
that
would
ban
the
offering
of
broad
category
of
contract
include
political
and
sport
base
event
contract
as
member
of
the
senate
committee
on
agriculture
nutrition
and
forestry
we
want
to
ensure
that
the
cftc
rulemaking
process
continue
to
be
guide
by
proper
market
oversight
and
integrity
without
stifle
innovation
since
its
inception
the
cftc
have
be
the
global
standard
for
sound
derivative
market
regulation
provide
certainty
to
market
participant
and
allow
for
agriculture
producer
and
commodity
trader
alike
to
hedge
risk
through
a
wide
variety
of
practice
the
cftc
base
on
its
congressional
mandate
have
long
foster
innovation
by
allow
the
offering
of
novel
product
and
allow
the
market
to
evaluate
the
utility
of
such
product
even
while
other
government
agency
fall
short
for
this
reason
we
be
concerned
about
the
commission
proceed
with
a
rule
that
may
limit
the
use
of
a
critical
investment
tool
election
have
tangible
impact
on
market
and
the
business
of
derivative
market
user
and
political
event
contract
can
serve
as
a
valuable
tool
to
protect
against
these
risk
these
market
also
provide
valuable
datum
on
trend
in
the
sentiment
of
the
voting
public
with
legitimate
public
and
academic
utility
other
emerge
asset
class
such
as
sport
relate
interest
have
express
need
for
similar
risk
management
product
and
your
rulemaking
would
seemingly
prejudge
the
validity
of
those
product
as
well
furthermore
american
investor
have
demonstrate
a
clear
desire
to
participate
in
these
market
and
it
be
far
preferable
that
they
do
so
on
platform
that
benefit
from
the
oversight
and
protection
provide
by
the
american
regulatory
structure
the
cftc
prohibit
the
use
of
these
market
in
the
will
only
serve
to
drive
american
investor
to
participate
in
offshore
market
where
they
be
leave
with
inadequate
safeguard
just
as
our
farmer
benefit
from
key
agriculture
future
contract
list
on
exchange
serve
as
global
benchmark
event
contract
particularly
on
election
should
be
subject
to
regulation
this
benefit
the
cftc
as
well
as
market
activity
take
place
on
a
exchange
improve
the
cftc
ability
to
facilitate
a
well
function
market
if
we
turn
a
blind
eye
to
these
market
the
cftc
have
no
say
in
the
integrity
and
customer
protection
requirement
it
be
not
a
typical
occurrence
for
the
cftc
to
place
a
blanket
restriction
on
multiple
asset
class
through
a
single
rulemaking
and
we
feel
that
should
the
cftc
move
forward
with
such
a
proposal
it
should
be
do
with
an
abundance
of
public
feedback
we
would
recommend
that
the
cftc
beyond
its
typical
open
meeting
process
consider
a
hearing
or
public
roundtable
to
allow
the
public
to
offer
view
on
the
value
of
event
contract
in
addition
the
timing
of
this
rulemaking
be
especially
concern
as
the
cftc
be
still
engage
in
multiple
lawsuit
relate
to
political
event
contract
a
blanket
ban
on
such
contract
have
the
potential
to
inappropriately
influence
the
judicial
branch
consideration
of
these
issue
which
we
feel
be
an
improper
use
of
the
commission
regulatory
authority
and
set
a
concern
precedent
of
influence
the
court
through
regulation
as
you
consider
any
rulemaking
proposal
we
urge
you
to
consider
the
value
of
these
innovative
contract
and
the
negative
consequence
of
ban
entire
class
of
product
instead
of
consider
contract
by
their
individual
merit
the
cftc
have
develop
a
well
earn
and
admirable
reputation
both
for
transparency
in
its
dealing
with
congress
and
the
market
it
regulate
and
for
openness
to
innovation
include
in
novel
product
in
carbon
and
digital
asset
market
especially
amid
ongoing
litigation
we
urge
you
to
continue
this
trend
and
engage
with
the
public
before
consider
any
blanket
ban
on
product
that
hold
value
to
the
american
people
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
matter
