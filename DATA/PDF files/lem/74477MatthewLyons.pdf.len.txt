I
be
write
to
express
my
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
propose
rule
on
event
contract
this
proposal
as
it
currently
stand
pose
significant
challenge
to
the
development
and
utility
of
event
contract
particularly
those
relate
to
election
below
I
outline
my
concern
and
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
approach
hedge
use
case
event
contract
especially
those
relate
to
election
provide
essential
tool
for
hedge
against
uncertainty
that
have
profound
impact
on
policy
the
economy
and
daily
life
election
can
lead
to
significant
shift
in
regulatory
and
economic
environment
affect
business
and
individual
alike
just
as
hedge
fund
utilize
complex
strategy
to
hedge
election
outcome
main
street
investor
should
also
have
access
to
tool
that
allow
they
to
manage
these
risk
effectively
these
contract
enable
individual
and
business
to
protect
themselves
against
potential
adverse
effect
of
electoral
outcome
ensure
stability
and
informed
decision
make
the
ability
to
hedge
these
risk
be
not
just
a
luxury
for
sophisticated
investor
but
a
necessity
for
all
market
participant
the
current
stance
of
the
cftc
as
reflect
in
its
recent
order
suggest
that
event
contract
relate
to
election
do
not
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
due
to
their
binary
nature
and
the
unpredictability
of
election
outcome
however
this
perspective
overlook
the
broad
economic
impact
that
election
result
can
have
affect
industry
market
and
individual
financial
position
market
participant
such
as
medium
company
and
consultancy
may
find
significant
value
in
hedge
against
the
direct
risk
stem
from
electoral
outcome
the
cftc
role
should
not
be
to
deny
market
participant
the
choice
of
financial
product
that
meet
their
hedging
need
simply
because
they
be
deem
not
effective
enough
by
the
commission
question
for
the
cftc
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
criterion
do
the
cftc
use
to
determine
the
hedge
utility
of
event
contract
and
how
do
it
account
for
the
broad
economic
impact
of
election
outcome
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
approach
do
not
inadvertently
push
market
participant
towards
unregulated
platform
thereby
increase
systemic
risk
3
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participant
to
well
understand
their
hedging
need
and
the
potential
utility
of
event
contract
in
meet
those
need
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
event
contract
that
have
be
deem
to
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
and
explain
the
rationale
behind
these
determination
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
its
concern
about
the
commoditization
of
the
electoral
process
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participant
with
legitimate
hedging
tool
by
address
these
question
the
cftc
can
provide
great
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
support
a
balanced
and
effective
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restrict
beneficial
trading
activity
it
be
crucial
that
the
commission
recognize
the
importance
of
these
market
in
provide
essential
hedging
tool
and
consider
how
they
can
be
regulate
to
maximize
their
utility
while
ensure
transparency
security
and
compliance
legal
and
regulated
market
the
existence
of
event
contract
on
unregulated
platform
like
polymarket
highlight
a
critical
gap
in
customer
protection
and
market
integrity
it
be
paradoxical
that
such
market
can
operate
without
oversight
while
regulate
exchange
which
have
system
in
place
for
customer
protection
kyc
know
your
customer

from
offer
these

the
cftc
should
focus
on
regulate
these
market
to
ensure
they
operate
within
a
legal

rather
than
push
they
to
unregulated
environment
that
lack
necessary
safeguard
regulated

be
equip
with
robust
mechanism
to
protect
market
participant
and
ensure
fair
trading
practice
by
prohibit
event

on
these
platform
the
cftc
inadvertently
encourage
the
growth
of
unregulated
market
where
participant
be
expose
to
high
risk
of
fraud
manipulation
and
lack
of
recourse
in
case
of
dispute
this
approach
undermine
the
cftc
mission
to
ensure
market
integrity
and
protect
consumer
instead
the
commission
should
leverage
its
regulatory
expertise
to
establish
guideline
that
allow
event
contract
to
be
trade
safely
and
transparently
on
regulate
exchange
question
for
the

ensure
that

2
how
do
the
cftc
justify
the
prohibition
of
event
contract
on
regulated
platform
while
allow
their
existence
on
unregulated
market
which
lack
essential
oversight
mechanism
3
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
stakeholder
include
exchange
and
market
participant
to
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
support
the
safe
and
legal
trading
of

4
can
the
cftc

of
successful
regulatory
framework
from
other
jurisdiction
that
have
effectively

5
how
will
the
cftc
balance

concern
about
the

with
the
need
to
provide

the

which
could
enhance

make
process
across

and
find
way
to
regulate

into
a

this
be
particularly
valuable
in
area
such
as

where
traditional

can
be
subject
to
bias
and
inaccuracy
the
insight

effectively
question
for
the
cftc
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
evidence
do
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
position
that

market
do
not
provide

how
do
this
compare
to
the
extensive

accuracy
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to

its
concern
about

and
market
manipulation
with
the
need
to

3
what

researcher
and
industry
expert
to
well
understand
the
value
and
potential
of
prediction
market
in
provide
accurate
forecast
invalid
cftc
argument
the
cftc
argument
against
election
market
lack
empirical
support
and
be
base
on
broad
assertion
rather
than
concrete
datum
the
claim
that
these
market
pose
a
threat
to
democracy
be
not
substantiate
by
any
rigorous
analysis
or
evidence
such
sweeping
statement
do
not
provide
a
valid
basis
for
a
blanket
ban
on
event
contract
the
cftc
reluctance
to
act
as
an
election
cop
do
not
justify
restrict
a
market
that
could
provide
valuable
tool
for
hedging
and
forecasting
instead
of
prohibit
these
market
outright
the
cftc
should
engage
in
the
hard
work
of
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
address
its
concern
while
allow
these
market
to
operate
the
assertion
that
allow
event

would
commoditize
the
electoral
process
overlook
the
potential
benefit
of
a
regulated
market
by
create
a
legal

transparent
environment
for
trade
these
contract
the
cftc
could
mitigate
risk
associate
with
unregulated
platform
ensure
consumer
protection
and
market
integrity
a
ban
be
a
simplistic
solution
that
fail
to
recognize
the
complexity
of
the
issue
and
the
potential
for
innovation
within
a
regulate
framework
moreover
the
cftc
have
not
adequately
consider
the
broad
implication
of
its
propose
ban
by
restrict
event
contract
the
commission
risk
push
market
participant
toward
unregulated
platform
where
oversight
and
consumer
protection
be
minimal
this
could
lead
to
increase
risk
of
fraud
and
manipulation
ultimately
undermine
the
very
integrity
the
cftc
seek
to
protect
question
for
the
cftc
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
empirical
evidence
do
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
assertion
that
election
market
pose
a
threat
to
democracy
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
differentiate
between
legitimate
market
activity
that
provide
valuable
hedging
and
forecasting
tool
and
those
that
may
be
deem
harmful
or
speculative
3
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
allow
for
innovation
and
the
development
of
event
contract
while
address
concern
about
potential
market
manipulation
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
other
market
or
sector
where
it
have
successfully
implement
regulation
that
balance
consumer
protection
with
the
promotion
of

5
how
will

engage
with
stakeholder
include

to
gather
input
on
the
potential

it
be

for

while
the

furthermore
the
