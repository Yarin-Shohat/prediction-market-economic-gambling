my
name
be
seth
weinstein
I
be
a
private
angel
investor
in
more
than
25
seed
stage
startup
one
of
those
investment
include
kalshi
I
formerly
work
as
a
manage
director
and
ceo
of
morgan
stanley
fund
service
kalshi
congressional
control
event
contract
promote
the
public
interest
and
should
be
accept
I
shall
address
several
question
that
the
cftc
have
put
forward
question
6
do
the
contract
serve
a
hedging
function
be
the
economic
consequence
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
base
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
example
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedge
directly
by
the
contract
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrate
the
hedge
utility
of
the
contract
these
contract
indisputably
serve
a
hedging
function
as
an
investor
I
have
hear
countless
pitch
from
would
be
business
that
face
risk
from
change
in
federal
policy
some
of
these
company
be
financial
firm
whose
entire
business
model
could
be
undo
by
a
change
in
financial
regulation
other
be
more
capital
intensive
industry
whose
effort
might
be
set
back
year
by
change
in
the
tax
code
or
other
policy
the
policy
risk
that
these
company
face
be
no
different
from
a
business
standpoint
than
physical
risk
like
natural
disaster
both
require
proper
hedging
the
economic
consequence
of
congressional
control
be
sufficiently
predictable
such
that
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedge
purpose
it
be
somewhat
surprising
to
hear
the
cftc
an
arm
of
the
federal
government
query
whether
the
government
matter
enough
that
people
might
be
affect
by
it
if
the
consequence
of
congressional
control
be
so
unpredictable
why
would
people
vote
the
fact
be
that
congressional
party
put
out
mountain
of
white
paper
speeche
policy
document
and
proposal
that
make
it
clear
what
their
priority
be
moreover
this
question
misunderstand
how
congress
impact
many
business
suppose
a
finance
critical
congress
come
into
power
one
may
argue
that
one
do
not
know
for
certain
that
this
congress
will
pass
a
bill
that
tighten
regulation
and
this
be
true
but
it
do
not
follow
from
that
statement
that
the
firm
need
not
hedge
any
competent
bank
venture
capital
firm
or
investor
thinking
about
invest
in
a
finance
firm
will
be
worry
that
the
congress
might
pass
such
a
bill
and
think
twice
before
lend
money
or
invest
in
the
company
they
might
charge
a
high
interest
rate
or
demand
more
equity
in
exchange
for
take
on
the
great
risk
since
financial
market
be
forward
look
the
impact
of
congressional
control
manifest
far
before
the
bill
actually
become
law
and
indeed
even
prior
to
the
new
congress
be
swear
in
as
a
result
even
though
it
be
true
that
congressional
policy
outcome
be
sufficiently
predictable
that
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedge
that
argument
be
not
even
necessary
the
directional
economic
impact
for
specific
firm
can
be
know
even
without
know
the
policy
outcome
question
7
be
there
unique
economic
risk
tie
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedge
via
derivative
product
on
equity
debt
interest
rate
tax
rate
asset
value
and
other
commodity
price
exist
derivative
product
be
useful
but
they
can
not
fully
hedge
this
risk
for
example
in
the
above
example
about
an
early
stage
financial
firm
the
concern
be
that
their
loan
payment
might
rise
due
to
expectation
of
great
policy
risk
or
the
term
they
be
offer
on
their
term
sheet
might
get
bad
one
may
wonder
why
they
could
not
buy
a
derivative
product
that
pay
out
if
interest
rate
rise
but
the
issue
be
that
in
this
example
the
economy
wide
interest
rate
be
not
rise
it
just
rise
for
specific
firm
who
face
elevated
risk
a
product
base
on
benchmark
interest
rate
simply
do
not
cover
increase
in
risk
premia
just
increase
in
the
risk
free
interest
rate
but
the
most
substantial
issue
be
why
do
it
matter
if
the
economic
risk
be
unique
there
be
nothing
in
the
regulation
nor
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
authorize
the
cftc
to
perform
a
uniqueness
test
if
anything
a
uniqueness
test
would
be
highly
anticompetitive
as
it
would
prohibit
any
challenger
from
offer
a
product
that
be
already
be
offer
by
an
incumbent
firm
it
also
would
stifle
innovation
since
it
would
prohibit
a
challenger
from
offer
a
product
that
improve
upon
any
exist
product
because
it
would
be
duplicate
the
economic
risk
of
the
incumbent
in
short
not
only
be
these
risk
unique
but
the
requirement
to
prove
uniqueness
have
no
legal
basis
and
if
implement
would
compromise
the
public
interest
10
should
the
commission
consider
the
contract
design
and
payout
when
try
to
assess
the
economic
utility
of
the
contract
for
example
be
binary
contract
useful
for
hedge
nonbinary
economic
event
the
commission
should
not
consider
design
and
payout
the
market
should
there
be
no
basis
in
the
regulation
or
the
cea
for
such
an
analysis
if
a
contract
design
be
a
poor
fit
for
hedging
then
the
contract
will
get
less
volume
and
the
exchange
will
suffer
financially
they
will
then
iterate
and
improve
upon
the
contract
until
it
a
well
fit
this
be
how
a
market
should
function
moreover
the
commission
who
do
not
speak
to
potential
customer
daily
like
an
exchange
do
be
not
in
an
epistemically
strong
position
to
evaluate
a
contract
design
and
payout
they
should
not
replace
the
market
judgment
with
their
own
nevertheless
binary
contract
be
useful
for
hedge
nonbinary
economic
event
all
economic
event
have
a
range
of
outcome
for
any
individual
hedge
party
and
yet
the
cftc
have
allow
several
exchange
include
kalshi
nadex
and
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
to
list
binary
contract
any
scalar
risk
can
be
decompose
into
a
series
of
binary
risk
this
question
fit
into
a
broad
theme
with
many
of
the
cftc
question
it
suppose
the
existence
of
some
form
of
test
that
the
regulation
and
cea
do
not
allow
and
even
though
kalshi
contract
consistently
pass
these
test
even
the
consideration
of
these
factor
should
be
a
cause
for
concern
about
the
commission
level
of
arbitrariness
and
caprice
11
do
the
contract
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
price
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
yes
indeed
as
someone
who
have
spend
my
career
on
wall
street
I
can
say
with
confidence
that
political
control
matter
for
accurately
price
commodity
and
other
financial
asset
as
mention
previously
financial
market
especially
future
market
and
equity
market
be
forward
look
future
market
for
instance
consider
the
expectation
of
the
future
spot
price
when
determine
the
price
to
pay
for
the
future
today
if
a
new
congress
come
into
power
that
change
future
expectation
of
supply
and
demand
affect
the
expectation
of
the
future
price
so
it
will
be
capitalize
into
today
price
for
instance
this
paper
use
datum
from
jim
jeffords
unexpected
party
switch
find
effect
of
change
in
congressional
control
on
the
stock
price
of
many
firm
so
not
only
could
estimate
of
the
probability
of
a
give
party
win
serve
a
price
basing
function
they
already
be
these
contract
would
merely
improve
that
price
discovery
by
provide
a
more
accurate
market
