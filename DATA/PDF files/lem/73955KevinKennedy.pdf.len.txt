effort
to
formalize
the
rule
regard

but
suggest
incorporate
certain
change
to
the

in
particular
nasdaq
believe
political
event
contract
pec
be
not
a
form
of
gambling
and
as
such
designate
contract
market
dcms
should
be
allow
to
list
such
contract
for

pursuant
to
of
the
commission
regulation
nasdaq
appreciate
the
thoughtful
series
of
question
include
in
the
rfc
and
submit
the
comment
below
with
the
intent
of
aid
the
commission
in
appropriately
regulate
event
contract
market
in
the
united
states
we
look
forward
to
ongoing
engagement
with
the
commission
as
it
consider
adopt
policy
in
this
space
as
a
preliminary
matter
nasdaq
would
like
to
voice
its
support
for
the
commission
overall
proposal
to
exclude
event
contract
that
involve
terrorism
assassination
war
and
illegal
activity
nasdaq
agree
with
the
commission
that
event
contract
focus
on
these
topic
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
should
be
prohibit
from
be
list
on
a
dcm
in
the
context
of
game
nasdaq
also
believe
that
the
proposal
to
exclude
event
contract
be
appropriate
and
that
it
would
be
good
to
allow
state
gaming
regulator
to
continue
to
exert
jurisdiction
in
this
space
nasdaq
disagree
however
with
the
commission
proposal
to
include
pec
within
the
definition
of
gaming
for
the
reason
outline
below
nasdaq
suggest
the
commission
revise
its
propose
rule
and
allow
for
the
listing
of
such
contract
on
dcms
nasdaq
believe
allow
the
listing
and
trading
of
pec
will
enhance
the
public
interest
by
provide
valuable
insight
into
the
state
of
the
political
environment
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
pec
will
also
benefit
from
the
system
of
federal
regulation
that
cftc
would
provide
in
this
marketplace
pec
be
contract
that
pay
out
base
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
or
the
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
of
an
event
relate
to
a
political
event
pec
can
serve
as
a
valuable
source
of
information
for
policymaker
analyst
journalist
and
the
general
public
as
they
reflect
the
aggregated
belief
and
expectation
of
market
participant
and
member
of
the
vote
public
pec
can
also
provide
incentive
for
information
discovery
and
dissemination
pec
have
be
trade
on
various
platform
such
as
predictit
iowa
electronic
market
and
betfair
for
many
year
and
have
attract
significant
attention
and
participation
from
the
public
pec
can
offer
a
useful
tool
in
analyze
election
and
other
political
phenomenon
as
they
can
complement
traditional
source
of
information
such
as
poll
survey
and
expert
opinion
furthermore
pec
possess
certain
characteristic
that
make
they
well
suit
to
predict
the
outcome
of
a
give
election
than
alternative
source
of
information
for
example
most
pec
market
operate
on
a
continuous
basis
with
price
formation
take
place
through
the
purchase
and
sale
of
contract
throughout
the
election
cycle
by
a
large
number
of
market
participant
the
price
discovery
that
take
place
through
this
process
be
base
on
a
large
pool
of
datum
and
therefore
a
sound
representation
of
the
sentiment
of
the
vote
public
in
contrast
a
poll
of
potential
voter
can
be
influence
by
the
question
ask
by
the
polling
entity
the
number
of
individual
poll
and
the
public
sentiment
at
the
specific
time
the
poll
be
conduct
pec
market
on
the
other
hand
represent
public
opinion
on
an
ongoing
basis
and
incorporate
all
publicly
available
information
about
the
election
in
real
time
there
be
empirical
datum
support
the
position
that
the
pec
market
provide
a
well
forecast
of
election
result
than
polling
while
there
be
a
positive
correlation
between
pec
result
and
polling
outcome
datum
suggest
that
pec
provide
a
more
accurate
assessment
of
voter
sentiment
of
real
time
development
during
the
election
cycle
and
be
well
at
forecast
the
winner
as
the
election

research
also
suggest
that
event
contract
in
general
produce
accurate
and
reliable
forecast
due
to
three
factor
the
market
mechanism
itself
be
an
algorithm
for
aggregate
information
there
be
a
financial
incentive
to
be
truthful
when
trade
in

in
order
to
reap
the
benefit
of
operate
under
correct
assumption
and
the
existence

it
be
notable
that
these
factor
be
not
present
in

research
also
suggest
that
event
contract
be
difficult
to
manipulate
I
d
at

cite
multiple
study
suggest
prediction
market
be
difficult
to
manipulate
the
commission
should
also
consider
that
pec
do
not
possess
certain
core
characteristic
that
be
find
in
gaming
contract
and
for
that
reason
should
be
allow
to
trade
on
cftc
regulate
market
unlike
gaming
contract
pec
serve
a
broad
purpose
than
merely
provide
a
mean
of
entertainment
for
the
trader
of
the
contract
as
note
above
pec
be
a
form
of
information
aggregation
and
expression
that
provide
a
means
of
determine
voter
sentiment
the
trading
volume
change
in
value
of
individual
contract
and
open
interest
throughout
the
lifecycle
of
the
election
allow
political
and
social
scientist
to
assess
the
current
and
future
state
of
the
political
environment
in
the
united
states
pec
do
not
involve
the
same
social
harm
or
negative
risk
as
gaming
such
as
addiction
crime
or
corruption
on
the
contrary
political
event
contract
can
promote
civic
engagement
political
literacy
and
public
discourse
nasdaq
would
also
like
to
note
that
allow
for
the
listing
and
trading
of
pec
will
bring
transparency
to
the
market
and
allow
it
to
operate
under
a
unified
umbrella
of
national
regulation
relegate
pec
to
the
purview
of
individual
state
will
have
multiple
drawback
first
it
will
prevent
resident
in
certain
state
from
participate
in
these
market
since
gaming
be
not
legal
in
all
fifty
state
second
divide
the
same
pec
across
multiple
state
will
reduce
the
trading
volume
and
market
participant
for
identical
contract
thus
reduce
the
benefit
obtain
by
allow
large
pool
of
market
participant
and
the
result
datum
their
trading
produce
to
trade
within
one
market
the
true
value
of
datum
obtain
from
any
individual
pec
come
in
large
part
from
the
aggregation
of
large
pool
of
datum
associate
with
the
trading
in
a
single
national
market
divide
an
election
into
dozen
of
individual
market
will
limit
the
value
and
accuracy
of
the
datum
from
any
individual
market
within
a
give
state
we
would
far
note
that
the
commission
should
place
certain
limitation
on
pec
as
it
do
with
other
commodity
market
to
mitigate
the
potential
for
manipulation
price
distortion
and
disruption
excessive
speculation
and
other
related
market
abuse
nasdaq
believe
clearly
define
position
limit
rule
accountability
regime
when
trade
in
a
specific
market
be
prudent
regulatory
tool
to
ensure
a
well
function
and
transparent
pec
market
additionally
individual
trade
in
pec
could
have
specific
dollar
limit
as
an
additional
mechanism
to
prohibit
manipulative
and
fraudulent
behavior
position
limit
can
far
be
define
for
individual
and
bona
fide
market
maker
subject
to
certain
obligation
we
believe
the
above
be
in
the
public
interest
and
will
benefit
prediction
market
for
the
forego
reason
we
recommend
that
the
commission
adopt
a
clear
and
consistent
definition
of
event
contract
that
exclude
pec
from
the
scope
of
gaming
or
wagering
we
believe
that
regulate
event
contract
especially
pec
will
bring
many
benefit
to
the
marketplace
and
the
political
discourse
in
the
united
states
regulation
will
provide
legal
certainty
and
legitimacy
to
pec
market
and
platform
which
will
encourage
innovation
and
competition
regulation
will
also
enhance
transparency
and
accountability
which
will
reduce
fraud
manipulation
and
abuse
we
thank
the
commission
for
its
leadership
and
vision
in
propose
a
regulatory
framework
for
event
contract
we
hope
that
our
comment
and
suggestion
will
be
helpful
in
the
finalization
and
implementation
of
the
rulemaking
we
look
forward
to
work
with
the
commission
and
other
stakeholder
in
develop
and
promote
event
contract
market
and
platform
sincerely
