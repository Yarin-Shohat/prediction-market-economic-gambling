dear
kirkpatrick
thank
you
for
provide
an
opportunity
for
the
public
to
comment
on
the
commission
propose
rule
pr
8907
24
I
write
to
express
my
opposition
to
the
propose
rule
my
reason
be
detail
below
adoption
of
the
propose
rule
would
unfairly
impact
the
ability
of
legal
business
in
the
gaming
industry
to
hedge
unwanted
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risk
by
prohibit
event
contract
design
with
gaming
industry
risk
in
mind
or
the
approval
of
specialized
derivative
exchange
offer
such
contract
this
impose
an
unfair
burden
on
firm
in
the
gaming
industry
the
commission
justify
the
propose
rule
base
on
its
interpretation
of
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
inclusion
of
cea
section
from
a
colloquy
between
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
report
in
the
congressional
record
on
15
july
2010
however
the
reasoning
underlie
the
statement
by
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
be
flaw
the
propose
rule
would
impose
an
unrealistic
and
unnecessary
burden
on
those
seek
commission
approval
of
new
event
contract
and
if
the
propose
rule
be
impose
retroactively
to
approve
future
contract
it
would
likely
result
in
many
if
not
most
exist
future
contract
be
delist
this
be
unlikely
to
have
be
the
true
intent
of
congress
1
propose
rule
make
it
difficult
for
legal
business
to
hedge
legitimate
business
risk
many
state
have
determine
that
sport
betting
be
in
the
public
interest
and
have
allow
sport
bet
firm
to
operate
in
their
state
these
firm
seek
to
manage
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risk
the
commission
have
resist
request
to
approve
specialized
exchange
or
derivative
contract
to
be
offer
on
exist
exchange
for
the
gaming
industry
the
propose
rule
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
firm
in
the
gaming
industry
to
efficiently
manage
risk
this
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest

liquid
future
market
require
both
hedger
and
speculator
the
colloquy
between
senator
lincoln
and
feinstein
be
use
to
support
a
broad
definition
of
the
public
interest
and
an
expand
economic
purpose
test
that
include
the
requirement
that
the
predominant
user
of
a
new
future
contract
must
be
hedger
again
the
statement
that
contract
must
be
predominantly
use
by
hedger
reveal
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
future
market
by
both
senator
market
participant
want
to
trade
on
deep
liquid
market
with
tight
bid
ask
spread
and
where
price
discovery
occur
quickly
this
require
the
participation
of
both
hedger
and
speculator
consider
the
follow
real
world
example
the
treasury
market
be
arguably
the
large
and
most
liquid
fix
income
security
market
in
the
world
much
of
the
liquidity
in
the
spot
market
be
provide
by
primary
government
security
dealer
however
their
willingness
to
do
so
depend
in
part
on
their
ability
to
hedge
their
risk
exposure
by
transfer
unwanted
risk
to
speculator
on
tuesday
october
20
1987
in
the
wake
of
the
stock
market
crash
the
day
before
30
year
treasury
bond
experience
their
large
one
day
rally
ever
spot
market
trading
essentially
cease
after
treasury
future
price
go
quickly
lock
limit
up
no
primary
government
security
dealer
would
make
a
market
for
treasury
security
in
the
spot
market
because
the
future
market
be
close
and
the
primary
government
security
dealer
could
not
hedge
themselves
normal
trading
resume
in
the
treasury
spot
market
after
the
future
market
reopen
and
hedger
could
transfer
unwanted
risk
to
speculator
in
the
future
market
speculator
be
frequently
need
to
take
the
other
side
of
future
contract
when
hedger
put
on
hedge
there
be
often
a
dearth
of
speculator
during
financial
crisis
and
not
a
dearth
of
hedger

speculator
in
exist
future
market
may
profit
from
devastating
event
the
commission
argue
that
former
senator
blanche
lincoln
statement
that
cea
section
be
intend
to
provide
the
cftc
with
the
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
future
and
swap
market
that
would
allow
citizen
to
profit
from
devastating
event
and
also
prevent
gambling
through
future
market
emphasis
add
senator
lincoln
statement
reveal
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
how
future
market
function
future
market
rely
on
both
hedger
and
speculator
to
create
deep
liquid
market
that
promote
efficient
price
discovery
hedge
against
potential
adverse
price
move
lock
in
a
purchase
or
sell
price
future
market
rely
on
both
hedger
and
speculator
to
create
deep
liquid
market
with
efficient
price
discovery
consider
the
follow
example
a
farmer
fear
that
the
price
of
corn
may
fall
before
his
corn
crop
be
harvest
so
the
farmer
sell
corn
future
contract
today
to
lock
in
a
selling
price
a
speculator
take
the
other
side
of
the
position
and
buy
corn
future
if
the
spot
price
of
corn
be
low
when
the
corn
be
harvest
the
low
price
that
the
farmer
receive
for
his
corn
in
the
spot
market
be
offset
by
the
profit
he
have
make
on
his
future
market
position
ignore
transaction
cost
and
assume
that
the
basis
be
zero
at
contract
expiration
the
farmer
gain
in
the
future
market
be
exactly
equal
to
the
speculator
loss
now
suppose
that
a
severe
drought
hit
the
corn
belt
destroy
a
large
amount
of
the
corn
crop
in
the
soil
the
price
of
corn
rise
dramatically
the
farmer
unaffected
by
the
drought
sell
his
corn
crop
at
the
substantially
high
spot
price
but
his
correspond
short
future
position
experience
significant
loss
after
consider
the
gain
from
sell
his
corn
crop
at
the
sharply
high
spot
price
and
the
loss
from
his
future
position
the
farmer
have
sell
his
corn
crop
at
the
fix
price
that
he
want
to
give
his
early
fear
that
corn
spot
price
might
fall
sharply
by
the
time
his
corn
crop
be
harvest
the
speculator
earn
substantial
profit
from
his
long
position
in
corn
future
as
corn
price
rise
due
to
a
devastating

a
shale

routinely
hedge
its
anticipated
output
in
the
future
market
by
sell
crude
oil
future
contract
to
lock
in
a
selling
price
a
speculator
take
the
other
side
of
the
position
and
buy

contract
a
major
energy
produce
nation
suddenly
invade
another
country
prompt

on
its

and

skyrocket
the
shale

extra
revenue
from
sell
oil
in
the
spot
market
at
sharply
high
price
per
barrel
be
offset
by

on
his
short
crude

future
position
the
shale
oil
producer
succeed
in
lock
in
a
selling
price
for
crude

the
speculator
long
position
in
crude
oil
have
benefit
greatly
due
to
a
devastating
event
a
surprise
foreign
war
a
steakhouse
restaurant
chain
fear
that
the
price
of
beef
might
rise
so
it
lock
in
a
purchase
price
by
buy
live

future
a
speculator
take
the
other
side
of
the
transaction
shortly
after
put
on
its
hedge
a
case
of
mad
cow
disease
be
discover
in
canada
even
though
canadian
cattle
be
deliverable
on
the
us
cattle
future
contract
the
price
of
live
cattle
drop
sharply
the
saving
the
restaurant
chain
subsequently
have
from
be
able
to
buy
beef
at
a
low
price
in
the
spot
market
be
offset
by
its
loss
on
its
long
live
cattle
future
position
the
speculator
short
position
have
benefit
greatly
due
to
a
devastating
event
discovery
of
mad
cow
disease
in
a
canadian
cattle
herd
put
differently
the
speculator
in
the
above
example
be
able
to
profit
from
devastating
event
something
that
senator
lincoln
want
to
see
the
commission
prevent
happen
while
hedger
be
able
to
lock
in
a
buying
or
sell
price
one
could
easily
imagine
similar
scenario
for
most
other
future
contract
should
the
commission
ban
corn
future
crude
oil
future
live
cattle
future
etc
to
ensure
that
speculator
never
profit
from
devastating
event
one
could
also
easily
imagine
scenario
where
speculator
suffer
substantial
loss
from
devastating
event
while
hedger
be
also
able
to
lock
in
a
buying
or
sell
price
indeed
the
gain
that
hedger
receive
in
such
scenario
come
from
the
loss
bear
by
speculator
ignore
transaction
cost
derivative
do
not
eliminate
risk
they
merely
transfer
risk
between
or
among
party
4
most
future
contract
be
game
contract
give
that
speculator
dominate
trade
the
colloquy
between
senator
lincoln
and
feinstein
be
also
use
to
support
an
unusual
definition
of
gaming
senator
feinstein
ask
senator
lincoln
will
cftc
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
be
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
be
speculative
as
oppose
to
a
hedging
or
economic
use
senator
lincoln
reply
that
be
our
intent
again
the
colloquy
reveal
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
about
the
nature
of
future
market
by
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
speculation
dominate
most
trading
in
future
market
rarely
be
a
buy
hedge
on
the
other
side
of
a
sell
hedge
and
vice
versa
rather
speculator
create
the
deep
liquid
future
market
that
make
it
easy
for
hedger
to
hedge
indeed
many
exist
future
contract
would
need
to
be
redefine
as
gaming
contract
if
the
criterion
be
the
amount
of
speculation
versus
hedge
it
be
doubtful
that
reclassify
virtually
all
exist
future
contract
as
gaming
contract
because
the
market
be
dominate
by
speculator
and
other
trader
without
a
commercial
or
hedge
interest
be
the
intent
of
congress
give
that
the
commission
be
subsequently
reauthorize
the
commission
have
wisely
reject
the
definition
of
gaming
by
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
its
propose
narrow
definition
of
gaming
however
the
commission
should
not
use
senator
feinstein
and
senator
lincoln
criterion
as
part
of
an
expand
economic
purpose
test
do
so
impose
an
unnecessary
burden
on
those
propose
new
event
contract
especially
give
that
many
exist
future
contract
would
be
hard
press
to
meet
that
same
standard
5
some
event
contract
on
exempted
commodity
meet
the
propose
gaming
definition
the
commission
cite
senator
lincoln
colloquy
with
senator
feinstein
to
support
the
notion
that
congress
intend
to
prohibit
event
contract
on
sporting
event
senator
lincoln
state
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
event
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
master
golf
tournament
these
type
of
contract
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
use
solely
for
gamble
the
commission
correctly
note
that
sport
event
themselves
be
not
consider
game
instead
the
commission
argue
on
page
23
that
cea
section
focus
on
the
overall
characteristic
of
the
contract
and
the
question
for
the
commission
in
evaluate
whether
a
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
or
prescribe
similar
activity
be
whether
the
contract
consider
as
a
whole
involve
one
of
those
activity
the
commission
also
argue
that
commodity
list
in
cea
section
would
be
exclude
from
the
propose
rule
on
event
contract
these
commodity
include
among
other
an
index
or
measure
of
inflation
or
other
macroeconomic
index
or
measure
the
commission
argue
that
these
commodity
should
be
exclude
because
they
already
serve
as
underlying
for
a
range
of
derivative
contract
that
be
broadly
trade
on
cftc
register
exchange
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
cea
section
it
be
easy
to
imagine
event
contract
tie
to
the
release
of
various
government
macroeconomic
report
such
as
the
inflation
rate
or
the
job
employment
situation
report
these
report
be
closely
watch
by
market
participant
and
often
have
a
significant
impact
on
financial
market
price
when
the
outcome
from
the
report
differ
from
the
consensus
expectation
of
the
outcome
economist
at
major
financial
institution
participate
in
survey
capture
their
belief
as
to
what
the
report
will
indicate
various
consensus
forecast
be
obtain
by
average
the
forecast
of
survey
economist
basically
market
participant
be
try
to
determine
whether
the
realize
outcome
the
monthly
inflation
rate
or
nonfarm
payroll
the
number
of
new
job
create
in
a
month
will
be
great
or
less
than
the
consensus
forecast
of
economist
put
differently
market
participant
be
arguably
stake
fund
on
the
outcome
of
a
competition
among
economist
this
seem
to
meet
the
commission
propose
definition
of
gaming
that
be
the
staking
or
risk
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
I
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
other
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involve
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitor
in
one
or
more
contest
or
game
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
if
so
how
would
a
potential
event
contract
on
a
macroeconomic
index
or
measure
differ
from
an
event
contract
on
a
gaming
industry
variable
if
they
do
differ
it
appear
that
the
commission
propose
definition
of
gaming
would
be
selectively
apply
to
the
detriment
of
firm
in
the
gaming
industry
in
need
of
tool
to
manage
their
risk
exposure
finally
senator
lincoln
assertion
that
event
contract
around
sporting
event
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
but
would
be
use
solely
for
gambling
ignore
both
the
need
that
firm
in
the
sport
bet
industry
have
to
manage
their
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risk
and
the
potential
benefit
that
specialized
event
contract
may
offer
such
firm
in
manage
their
risk
exposure
again
nearly
forty
state
have
determine
that
allow
bet
on
sport
event
be
in
the
public
interest
sport
bet
firm
be
regulate
and
license
they
have
legitimate
business
risk
they
should
be
allow
to
use
tool
that
would
help
they
manage
their
exposure
to
such
risk
