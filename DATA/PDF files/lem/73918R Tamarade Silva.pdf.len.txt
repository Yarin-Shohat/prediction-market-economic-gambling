future
contract
they
be
design
to
transfer
risk
associate
with
catastrophic

provide
a
valuable
hedging
tool
for
the
insurance

the
foresight
of
the
exchange
be
remarkable
arguably
we
may
be
see
what
happen
when
the
insurance
industry
can
not
adequately
transfer
risk
and
the
cost
be
pass
to
the
consumer
public
while
there
may
arguably
be
valid
public
policy
reason
to
exclude
election
event
contract
it
be
important
to
recognize
that
they
share
similarity
with
catastrophic
event
in
term
of
the
systemic
risk
they
pose
to
the

allow

for
such

would
provide
a
structured

mechanism
benefit

the
concept
of

as
establish
in

future
market
extend
beyond

definition
of
the

during
the
crash
of
1987
market
participant
be
able
to
short
the
equity
market
through
the
use
of
future
by
consider
the
inclusion
of
election
contract
within
this
framework
the
commission
can
enhance
the
market
ability
to
manage
a
broad
range
of
risk
this
approach
align
with
the
overarching
goal
of
provide
robust
risk
management
tool
to
market
participant
game
theory
argument
from
a
game
theory
perspective
the
inclusion
of
future
contract
for
catastrophic
event
can
create
a
more
resilient
market
structure
in
an
environment
where
market
participant
can
hedge
against
systemic
risk
the
overall
market
become
more
robust
and
less
susceptible
to
panic
and
systemic
failure
this
strategic
interaction
benefit
all
participant
by
distribute
risk
more
effectively
reduce
the
likelihood
of
extreme
outcome
that
can
destabilize
the
entire
financial
system
moreover
by
allow
hedge
against
large
scale
risk
future
market
can
encourage
proactive
risk
management
and
investment
in
mitigation
strategy
foster
a
more
stable
economic
environment
in
game
theory
the
concept
of
nash
equilibrium
can
be
apply
to
understand
how
future
market
for
catastrophic
event
can
stabilize
the
financial
system
suppose
each
market
participant
I
have
a
set
of
strategy
si
which
include
hedge
through
future
contract
the
utility
function
ui
si
represent
the
participant
payoff
where
denote
the
strategy
of
all
other
participant
in
a
nash
equilibrium
each
participant
strategy
be
optimal
give
the
strategy
of
other
by
hedge
through
future
contract
participant
mitigate
their
exposure
to
catastrophic
risk
lead
to
a
stable
equilibrium
where
no
participant
can
improve
their
utility
by
unilaterally
change
their
strategy
this
equilibrium
reduce
the
overall
risk
in
the
system
contribute
to
market
stability
conclusion
in
conclusion
recognize
and
incorporate
future
contract
as
bona
fide
risk
transfer
mechanism
for
systemic
risk
and
catastrophic
event
align
with
the
fundamental
purpose
of
future
market
if
the
regulated
future
market
be
able
to
hedge
the
risk
of
the
entire
economy
through
interest
rate
and
the
domestic
capital
market
through
financial
future
it
can
serve
as
a
hedge
against
election
risk
I
applaud
the
work
of
the
cftc
in
its
work
of
keep
the
united
states
future
market
among
if
not
the
most
transparent
and
liquid
financial
market
in
the
world
the
commission
would
be
well
advise
to
see
how
election
and
other
event
contract
can
play
a
crucial
role
in
enhance
market
stability
provide
valuable
risk
signal
and
support
innovation
in
risk
management
it
be
up
to
the
task
I
urge
the
cftc
to
consider
these
argument
and
facilitate
the
development
of
event
future
contract
thereby
strengthen
the
financial
market
ability
to
manage
systemic
risk
effectively
