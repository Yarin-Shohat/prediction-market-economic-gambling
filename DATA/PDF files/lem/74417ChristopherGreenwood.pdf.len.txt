the

that

somehow
undermine

on

appear
to
be
base

a
misunderstanding
of

federal

rule
that
rule
come
into

when
there
be
among
other
factor
communication
between
a

a
pac
or
other
outside
spender
political

contract
neither
involve
nor
facilitate
contact
between

other

so
those
contract
can
not
play
a
role
in
circumvent
the
fec
coordination
rule
in
a
large
liquid

political

could
not
be
use
successfully
to
manipulate

the
only
cited
example
of
manipulation
of

be
the
romney

the
romney
trader
be
able
to
generate
a
small
temporary
spike
in
romney
support
number
only
because
the
intrade
market
be
small
and
shallow
even
in
that
case
most
of
the
bump
cause
by
the
trader
large
position
be
arbitrage
away
fairly
quickly
in
a
large

liquid

which
would
be
make
possible
by
cftc
approval
it
would
be
financially
impossible
for
a
single
trader
or
even
a
group
of

to
manipulate

because
arbitrager
and

hold
contrary

would
be
