I
of

far
specify
the
type
of

of

and
may
not
be

authorize
the

to
prohibit
certain
event
contract
from
be
list
or
make
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
register
entity
if
such
contract
involve
an
activity
that
be
enumerate
in
cea
one
category
of
contract
that
be
currently
prohibit
by
section
be
game
contract
and
the
propose
amendment
would
far
clarify
the
type
of
contract
cover
by
that
prohibition
include
those
that
involve
sport
wager
the
nfl
remain
concerned
in
light
of
several
outstanding
question
that
if
sport
wagering
contract
be
to
be
permit
they
potentially
could
negatively
impact
the
integrity
of
and
consumer
confidence
in
our
game
the
nfl
be
concerned
that
if
sport
relate
gaming
contract
be
to
be
permit
such
contract
may
not
be
use
in
a
legitimate
effort
to
mitigate
commercial
risk
these
contract
would
mimic
sport
bet
but
seemingly
without
the
robust
regulatory
feature
that
accompany
regulate
and
legalized
sport
betting
and
which
help
to
mitigate
threat
to
the
integrity
of
our
contest
they
would
fall
outside
the
purview
of
sport
bet
regulatory
authority
and
the
safeguard
they
impose
upon
the
industry
we
agree
with
the
commission
that
participant
in
sport
relate
gaming
contract
market
would
primarily
be
speculator
rather
than
participant
with
legitimate
commercial
hedge
interest
and
we
share
the
concem
that
these
contract
if
not
properly
regulate
could
be
susceptible
to
manipulation
or
price
distortion
it
be
also
possible
that
if
sport
relate
gaming
contract
market
be
permit
the
amount
wager
through
these
market
by
individual
speculator
could
be
significantly
large
than
those
typically
wager
through
the
regulate
sport
bet
market
potentially
create
great
risk
to
contest
integrity
any
future
consideration
of
these
contract
should
thoroughly
address
these
issue
since
the
repeal
of
the
professional
and
amateur
sport
protection
act
paspa
thirty
eight
state
and
the

columbia
and
have
utilize

to
allow

the
sport

ecosystem
be
interconnect
between
professional
sport
organizing
body
the
operator
advertiser
legislator
and
regulator
lawmaker
in
many
state
have
enact
robust
regulatory
regime
which
include
measure
to
promote
information

between

league
sport
