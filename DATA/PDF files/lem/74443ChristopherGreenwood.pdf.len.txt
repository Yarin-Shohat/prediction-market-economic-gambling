I
write
to
urge
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
to
proceed
deliberately
and
transparently
in
consider
any
propose
rule
regard
the
listing
of
event
contract
by
designate
contract
market
dcms
the
commission
have
a
long
history
of
promote
leadership
on
the
global
stage
and
encourage
financial
market
innovation
future
market
originally
offer
product
focus
on
agricultural
market
necessary
for
farmer
and
rancher
to
hedge
risk
the
forward
look
cftc
have
over
time
approve
product
that
be
not
originally
contemplate
by
lawmaker
who
create
the
commission
and
its
authority
but
that
fit
within
the
cftc
congressional
mandate
product
base
on
volatility
interest
rate
foreign
currency
weather
water
and
digital
asset
have
be
allow
by
the
commission
and
have
demonstrate
market
value
exclude
broad
category
of
product
go
against
the
cftc
mandate
to
foster
innovation
I
be
concern
by
report
that
a
draft
event
contract
rule
be
evaluate
by
the
commission
could
limit
the
ability
of
main
street
investor
to
hedge
risk
base
on
event
move
forward
with
a
rule
that
limit
event
contract
would
stifle
innovation
and
run
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
other
jurisdiction
have
approve
event
contract
for
investor
to
utilize
in
hedge
risk
block
the
development
of
these
product
on
our
shore
will
place
market
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
and
drive
innovative
company
overseas
furthermore
I
have
concern
that
the
cftc
may
attempt
to
advance
an
event
contract
rule
through
a
closed
door
process
without
a
public
meeting
the
cftc
be
well
than
that
a
proposal
that
would
ban
product
with
clear
economic
value
to
main
street
americans
should
not
be
advance
without
a
public
vote
by
the
commission
I
appreciate
your
commitment
to
transparency
to
date
and
ask
that
you
continue
in
that
vein
as
the
commission
evaluate
an
event
contract
rulemake
