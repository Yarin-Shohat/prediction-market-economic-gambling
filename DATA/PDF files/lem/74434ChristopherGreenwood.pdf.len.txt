neither

on

issue
in
this
case
first
the
commission
fundamentally
misunderstand
what
the
statute
mean
when
it
refer
to
event
contract
that
involve
the
enumerate

the
cftc
acknowledge
that
for
most
of

the
question
be
whether
the

for

and

the

insist
the
question

whether

those
be
two
totally
different
inquiry
the

identify
no

this
reading
fly
in
the
face
of
basic
interpretive
principle
and
also
upend
the
basic

of
the

second
the
commission
initial
wrong
turn
force
it
down
other
blind
alley
it
claim
that
buy

kalshi
contract
involve
gaming
but
there
be
no
game
here
only
real
world
event
with
real
economic
impact
nor
can
the
cftc
construe
game
broadly
to
mean
all
gambling
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
since
that
would
sweep
in
all
event
contract
make
nonsense
of
the
statutory
enumeration
the
commission
admit
as
much
attempt
to
steer
between
that
scylla
and
charybdis
it
gerrymander
a
novel
definition
of
gaming
to
cover
wager
on

or

but
nothing
else
the
commission
can
not
and
do
not
explain
however
why
that
neither

nor
there
interpretation
be
the
good
reflection
of
congressional
intent
as
oppose
to
the
good
way
to
ensnare
kalshi
contract
which
appear
to
be
the
commission
sole
objective
and
the
game
or
contest
construction
fail
even
on
that
score
since
election
be
plainly
not
contest
under
the
state
gambling
statute
upon
which
the
commission
rest
the
cftc
attempt
to
condemn
kalshi
contract
as
involve
unlawful
activity
require
even
strange
contortion
it
argue
that
this
category
be
implicate
because
some
state
prohibit
bet
on
election
but
as
the
order
itself
observe
many
state
ban
all
wager
on
contingency
on
the
commission
logic
every
event
contract
thus
involve
unlawful
activity
in
just
the
same
way
as
kalshi
congressional
control
contract
do
despite
some
nearly
unintelligible
denial
the
commission
effectively
admit
as
much
it
thereby
turn
the
statutory
scheme
on
its
head
and
effectively
reinstate
the
across
the
board
pre
clearance
regime
that
congress
repeal
decade
ago
that
can
not
be
right
finally
the
commission
effort
to
prop
up
the
order
public

find
fall
flat
it
be
undeniable
that

people

indeed
hardly
any

as
much
as

and
if

the
risk
associate

they
can
be
hedge
that
simple
reality
be
more
than
enough
to
align
kalshi
contract
with
the
public
interest
in
its
brief
the
commission
only
double
down
on
the

analytical
error
it
ignore
the
mountain
of
concrete
evidence
of
the

benefit
while
repeat
irrelevant
platitude
about
election

which
kalshi
wholeheartedly
support
and
elevate
unfounded
bogeyman
claim
that
have
no
basis
in

the
commission
try
to
hide
behind
the
formality
that
the
order
result
from
an
informal
adjudication
but
that
be
no
excuse
for
arbitrary
and
capricious
reasoning
the
cftc
choose
to
ask
for
the
public

then
ignore
