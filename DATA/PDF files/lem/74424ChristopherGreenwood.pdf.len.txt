I
support
kalshi
bid
to
host
election
market
because
I
believe
in
democracy
to
claim
that
election
market
be
game
would
be
to
claim
that
election
do
not
have
predictable
consequence
for
the
world
clearly
the
action
of
policymaker
do
have
consequence
something
directly
impact
my
bottom
line
be
the
decision
make
by
the
government
around
the
forgiveness
of
student
loan
thus
the
relevant
question
be
whether
such
decision
outcome
be
predictable
base
on
which
party
win
an
election
if
these
outcome
be
not
predictable
despite
the
platform
goal
of
the
two
party
clearly
differ
from
one
another
then
the
democratic
system
be
a
failure
why
bother
vote
if
outcome
be
not
predictable
what
would
be
leave
of
the
claim
that
america
have
a
globally
envy
political
system
if
its
premier
financial
regulator
say
that
actually
the
american
people
be
chump
for
expect
their
vote
the
expression
of
their
collective
political
desire
to
actually
change
the
country
in
the
manner
they
desire
at
a
time
when
democracy
be
threaten
both
at
home
and
abroad
I
hope
the
cftc
do
do
further
damage
by
undermine
the
intellectual
justification
for
voting
