to
whom
it
may
concern
my
name
be
sam
steyer
and
I
write
on
behalf
of
myself
and
greenwork
where
I
co
founder
and
ceo
greenwork
be
a
software
company
that
help
clean
energy
company
build
their
installation
and
construction
capacity
we
offer
our
customer
tool
to
hire
skilled
tradespeople
build
a
network
of
local
contractor
and
ensure
compliance
with
labor
regulation
I
write
in
support
of
kalshi
political
control
contract
which
would
greatly
help
mitigate
risk
and
provide
accurate
information
for
business
like
our
that
engage
in
politically
sensitive
sector
energy
as
a
sector
have
always
be
deeply
tie
with
policy
and
regulation
from
the
early
day
electric
utility
have
operate
under
a
government
grant
monopoly
and
be
subject
to
a
regulated
rate
of
return
model
the
us
government
have
be
deeply
involve
in
ensure
access
to
oil
at
reasonable
price
through
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
and
negotiation
with
foreign
party
like
opec
most
recently
we
have
be
thrill
to
watch
the
passage
of
the
landmark
inflation
reduction
act
which
invest
369b
in
clean
energy
and
climate
work
over
10
year
and
we
view
as
foundational
to
bring
about
a
zero
carbon
energy
transition
greenwork
have
already
experience
the
importance
of
government
policy
very
directly
much
of
this
experience
have
be
very
positive
we
be
member
of
the
department
of
energy
well
building
workforce
accelerator
and
have
apply
to
both
california
and
federal
grant
policy
like
the
investment
tax
credit
and
california
net
metering
rule
be
fundamental
to
the
success
of
many
of
our
customer
in
the
solar
industry
one
early
potential
greenwork
cofounder
do
not
join
the
company
in
part
out
of
concern
that
if
an
administration
that
be
skeptical
of
clean
energy
be
elect
in
2020
it
would
undermine
our
customer
and
our
business
to
be
clear
election
risk
be
a
major
concern
for
a
co
founder
who
would
have
greatly
help
our
business
and
will
remain
a
clear
and
tangible
risk
that
our
business
face
go
forward
this
be
a
great
example
of
exactly
the
use
case
of
kalshi
contract
and
the
fear
that
market
participant
have
not
just
that
a
particular
policy
will
be
enact
but
rather
that
a
government
hostile
to
our
interest
could
be
elect
who
could
implement
myriad
such
policy
through
regulation
subsidy
judicial
nomination
taxation
departmental
appointment
and
more
such
an
election
would
deter
not
just
cofounder
but
investor
and
partner
as
well
the
election
risk
be
the
thing
we
wish
to
hedge
uniquely
in
addition
decision
like
those
would
be
make
with
more
confidence
and
certainty
if
kalshi
contract
be
permit
for
approval
a
market
on
election
outcome
would
be
a
well
prediction
tool
than
current
polling
and
modeling
by
aggregate
all
information
and
have
people
put
their
personal
wealth
on
the
line
we
gladly
use
this
information
in
order
to
inform
company
decision
as
would
other
in
the
industry
the
2022
midterm
be
no
different
the
inflation
reduction
act
of
2022
be
the
most
important
climate
and
clean
energy
legislation
ever
pass
in
the
united
states
the
way
that
it
be
implement
over
the
come
month
and
year
will
have
a
very
meaningful
effect
on
our
business
for
example
if
the
prevail
wage
and
apprenticeship
requirement
in
the
bill
be
robustly
support
as
we
expect
they
will
be
under
a
pro
labor
government
that
will
create
demand
for
hr
service
like
our
that
help
company
invest
in
worker
training
and
well
be
pay
more
to
provide
a
well
worker
experience
and
create
a
market
for
greenwork
I
believe
that
small
business
such
as
ours
should
have
tool
to
hedge
against
political
outcome
impact
on
their
business
in
the
same
way
that
large
company
in
practice
already
do
to
that
end
I
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
contract
before
the
october
28th
state
deadline
if
at
all
possible
