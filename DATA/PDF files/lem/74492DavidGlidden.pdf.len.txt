I
write
to
express
my
disagreement
with
the
commission
propose
amendment
to
its
rule
concern
event
contract

event
contract
summary
I
appreciate
the
commission
desire
to
provide
clarity
in
the
area
of
event
contract
to
reduce
burden
and
waste
effort
by
register
entity
new
applicant
and
the
commission
staff
however
I
believe
that
the
commission
have
incorrectly
evaluate
the
public
interest
consideration
of
these
contract
contract
involve
political
event
be
very
much
in
the
public
interest
serve
to
strengthen
not
weaken
our
democratic
electoral
process
the
volatile
political
event
of
this
summer
2024
occur
after
the
amendment
be
propose
highlight
the
demand
and
need
for
fast
access
to
the
wisdom
of
the
crowd
provide
by
these
event
contract
the
commission
should
be
wary
of
the
unintended
consequence
of
limit
these
contract
to
platform
where
americans
can
not
participate
and
where
the
commission
can
not
regulate
they
finally
I
ask
the
commission
to
reconsider
and
identify
alternative
solution
to
its
concern
with
regard
to
how
to
structure
political
event
contract
to
avoid
put
the
commission
in
the
position
of
an
election
cop
and
how
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
relate
to
event
contract
outline
of
argument
1
contract
involve
political
event
be
very
much
in
the
public
interest
the
political
event
of
summer
2024
have
show
the
importance
and
demand
of
the
wisdom
generate
by
such

contract
2
if
the
commission
be
genuinely
concerned
about
the
impact
of
political
event
contract
on
the
integrity
of
our
election
it
should
strongly
consider
the
unintended
consequence
of
far
cement
the
influence
of
unregulated
offshore
event
contract
platform
accessible
only
to
foreign
actor
3
the
commission
can
enable
event
contract
to
be
structure
in
way
that
do
not
put
it
in
the
position
of
be
an
election
cop
4
the
commission
interpretation
about
political
event
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
law
be
misguide
upon
close
reading
of
the
authority
give
to
the
commission
argument
the
commission
ask
be
there
factor
in
addition
to
those
describe

that
may
be
relevant

evaluate
whether
a

or

be
contrary
to
the
public

1
contract
involve
political
event
be
very
much
in
the
public
interest
the
political
event
of
summer
2024
have
show
the
importance
and
demand
of
the
wisdom
generate
by
such
event
contract
commenter
in
favor
of
political
event
contract
have
speak
at
length
to
their
value
in
previous
comment
period
relate
to
nadex
and
more
recently
kalshi
I
submit
my
personal
support
in
favor
of
these
contract
while
I
personally
do
not
trade
in
significant
volume
on
platform
like
predictit
or
kalshi
I
be
a
frequent
consumer
of
the
wisdom
they
provide
those
platform
along
with
play
money
prediction
market
like
manifold
be
the
primary
way
I
get
my
news
especially
political
news
they
allow
I
to
be
a
more
informed
citizen
due
to
their
wisdom
of
the
crowd
approach
of
aggregate
all
other
news
source
into
quantitative
probability
these
market
be
the
most
effective
method
we
have
of
derive
intelligence
price
discovery
of
political
outcome
that
financially
reward
those
who
be
free
of
opinion
and
bias
for
anything
but
the
truth
in
footnote
125
of
the
notice
of
propose
rulemake
the
commission
rightly
state
that
certain
commenter
on
the
contract
subject
to
the
kalshi
order
assert
that
event
contract
involve
occurrence
in
connection
with
political
election
contest
could
serve
as
a
check
on
misinformation
and
inaccurate
polling
state
that
market
base
alternative
tend
to
be
more
accurate
than
polling
or
other
method
of
predict
election
outcome
I
agree
with
those
commenter
the
commission
go
on
to
express
the
concern
that
a
seemingly
false
or
unreliable
poll
can
cause
significant
movement
on
an
event
contract
market
and
suggest
that
such
poll
could
have
be
or
at
least
could
be
create
to
cause
such
market
movement
far
argue
that
such
false
poll
can
have
a
real
and
detrimental
effect
on
election
cite
an
article
by
former
fivethirtyeight
journalist
harry
enten
since
write
that
article
enten
have
publicly
comment
on
the
usefulness
of
political
event
market
to
understand
the
conventional
wisdom
and
regularly
reference
such
market
in
his
current
position
as
a
senior
data
reporter
at
cnn
this
suggest
that
the
fear
of
fake
polling
have
a
significant
negative
impact
on
the
value
of
prediction
market
be
overblown
relative
to
the
value
these
market
provide
in
my
anecdotal
experience
in
the
political
forecasting
twittersphere
misinformation
and
inaccurate
poll
be
notice
and
publicize
as
a
result
of
the
overall
trading
community
have
a
financial
incentive
to
identify
and
flag
they
all
this
say
these
argument
in
favor
of
political
event
contract
do
not
yet
seem
to
have
be
persuasive
to
the
commission
as
suggest
by
these
late
propose
amendment
to
categorize
political
event
contract
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
therefore
I
implore
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
position
give
the
volatile
political
event
of
summer
2024
follow
the
commission
notice
of
this
propose
rulemake
this
summer
which
have
see
unprecedented
political
uncertainty
follow
the
presidential
debate
between
president
biden
and
former
president
trump
an
attempt
assassination
of
former
president
trump
president
biden
subsequent
withdrawal
from
the
race
vice
president
harris
quick
rise
to
nomination
and
two
major
party
vice
presidential
candidate
selection
have
show
the
importance
and
demand
of
the
wisdom
generate
by
prediction
market
platform
offer
political
event
contract
or
the
like
polymarket
alone
have
hit
record
high
trading
volume
in
both
june
m
and
july
m
up
to
over
600
of
its
previous
high
in
may
m
suggest
that
we
be
in
a
era
that
be
different
and
distinct
from
the
time
during
which
the
propose
rulemaking
be
draft
as
such
the
commission
should
take
a
renew
look
at
its
perspective
that
political
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
2
if
the
commission
be
genuinely
concerned
about
the
impact
of
political
event
contract
on
the
integrity
of
our
election
it
should
strongly
consider
the
unintended
consequence
of
far
cement
the
influence
of
unregulated
offshore
event
contract
platform
accessible
only
to
foreign
actor
as
evidence
by
the
aforementioned
increase
in
demand
of
polymarket
political
event
contract
product
I
urge
the
commission
to
carefully
consider
whether
it
want
to
hand
the
gift
of
a
monopoly
on
political
event
contract
to
polymarket
it
be
illegal
for
americans
to
participate
in
polymarket
and
as
such
it
be
only
available
to
foreign
actor
if
the
commission
be
genuinely
concerned
about
the
impact
of
political
event
contract
on
the
integrity
of
our
election
and
polymarket
be
become
an
authoritative
source
on
political
news
through
its
political
event
contract
the
commission
should
consider
unintended
consequence
of
exclude
americans
from
these
market
these
be
the
people
who
be
close
to
as
chairman
benham
state
the
uniquely
american
experience
of
participate
in
the
democratic
electoral
process
who
could
provide
improved
accuracy
to
price
discovery
on
political
topic
as
such
the
commission
should
carefully
evaluate
the
risk
of
cement
the
influence
of
foreign
actor
through
these
unregulated
offshore
platform
3
the
commission
can
enable
event
contract
to
be
structure
in
way
that
do
not
put
it
in
the
position
of
be
an
election
cop
in
chairman
benham
statement
7
he
express
the
concern
that
allow
these
contract
would
push
the
cftc
a
financial
market
regulator
into
a
position
far
beyond
its
congressional
mandate
and
expertise
to
be
blunt
such
contract
would
put
the
cftc
in
the
role
of
an
election
cop
this
seem
like
it
could
be
easily
avoid
by
ensure
clear
resolution
term
for
a
contract
for
example
rather
than
a
contract
that
resolve
accord
to
a
particular
winner
of
an
election
the
commission
could
require
event
contract
along
the
line
of
who
will
be
president
on
january
21st
2025
the
day
after
inauguration
day
with
clear
instruction
include
potential
delay
in
resolution
as
need
in
the
event
of
any
dispute
similarly
the
commission
could
decide
not
to
permit
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
include
an
election
or
election
but
permit
an
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
such
as
whether
a
certain
individual
be
report
by
the
new
york
times
as
be
swear
in
on
inauguration
day
the
commission
would
therefore
be
only
responsible
for
investigate
fraud
manipulation
and
the
like
to
the
reporting
by
such
an
organization
not
the
underlie
political
event
themselves
the
commission
request
comment
on
all
aspect
of
its
propose
public
interest
determination
with
respect
to
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
4
the
commission
interpretation
about
political
event
contract
involve
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
state
law
be
misguide
upon
close
reading
of
the
authority
give
to
the
commission
even
if
the
commission
believe
that
political
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
I
agree
with
kalshi
argument
that
the
commission
authority
in
determine
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
limit
only
to
if
the
contract
one
of
six
enumerate
activity
include
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
give
that
election
be
not
unlawful
then
contract
on
they
should
not
be
subject
to
the
public
interest
evaluation
the
commission
perceive
authority
to
subject
a
contract
to
an
evaluation
of
public
interest
simply
because
the
act
of
trading
on
such
contract
may
be
unlawful
under
a
state
law
be
an
overreach
it
not
the
trading
that
be
subject
to
state
law
but
rather
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
thank
you
for
your
consideration
