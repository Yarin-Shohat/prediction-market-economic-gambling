I
be
write
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
propose
ban
on
election
contract
and
prediction
market
this
decision
seem
to
lack
sufficient
datum
engagement
and
justification
I
believe
it
be
crucial
for
the
cftc
to
address
several
important
question
regard
this
proposal
1
what
specific
datum
or
evidence
do
the
cftc
have
to
support
the
claim
that
election
market
pose
a
significant
risk
to
the
integrity
of
election
2
how
do
the
cftc
differentiate
between
gambling
and
legitimate
financial
risk
management
in
the
context
of
prediction
market
3
what
engagement
have
the
cftc
conduct
with
stakeholder
include
prediction
market
platform
investor
and
the
public
to
assess
the
potential
impact
of
this
ban
4
why
do
the
cftc
believe
that
ban
election
market
will
prevent
potential
election
tampering
or
misinformation
campaign
as
oppose
to
regulate
they
to
ensure
transparency
and
integrity
5
how
do
the
cftc
address
concern
that
ban
these
market
might
push
they
to
offshore
and
illegal
platform
where
there
be
no
regulation
or
consumer
protection
6
what
be
the
economic
implication
of
this
ban
for
business
and
investor
who
use
these
market
as
tool
for
hedge
against
political
risk
7
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
address
the
legal
challenge
pose
by
platform
like
kalshi
and
predictit
which
argue
that
the
agency
have
overstep
its
authority
8
what
measure
do
the
cftc
propose
to
implement
to
ensure
that
innovation
in
financial
market
be
not
stifle
by
this
ban
9
how
do
the
cftc
reconcile
its
decision
with
the
fact
that
prediction
market
have
provide
valuable
datum
for
gauge
public
sentiment
and
economic
forecasting
10
what
alternative
solution
have
the
cftc
consider
that
would
allow
election
market
to
operate
under
a
regulate
framework
ensure
both
market
integrity
and
consumer
protection
I
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
and
provide
clear
answer
to
these
question
it
be
essential
to
recognize
the
potential
benefit
of
regulated
prediction
market
and
to
develop
a
framework
that
allow
they
to
operate
safely
and
effectively
within
the
financial
system
