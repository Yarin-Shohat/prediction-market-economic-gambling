court
must
now
use
traditional
tool
of
statutory
construction
to
determine
the
good
reading
of
a
statute
and
ensure
the
agency
action
align
with
it
while
an
agency
opinion
can
still
be
consider
if
find
to
be
persuasive
any
ambiguity
in
statute
must
now
be
address
by
congress
rather
than
agency
interpretation
this
shift
necessitate
that
an
agency
interpretation
align
closely
with
the
statutory
text
and
legislative
intent
of
the
relevant
statute
this
be
what

to

the

equate

demand
a
thorough
review
by
the
court
specifically
our
concern
be
the
follow
1
definition
of

the

seek
to
define

as
the
staking
or

the
commission
have
make
clear
this
definition
would
include
political
contest
and
in
its
view
an
election
relate
event
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
disagree
with
that
perspective
political
event
contract
should
not
be
equate
with
gambling
on
game
of
chance
like
the
super
bowl
rather
election
have
significant
economic
implication
these
contract
be
design
to
serve
crucial
risk
hedging
function
align
with
the
requirement
of
the
cea
and
offer
valuable
predictive
datum
to
the
public
for
these
reason
they
should
not
be
consider
contrary
to
the
public
interest
furthermore
the
propose
rule
exceed
the

by
partially

public
interest
determination
the
cftc
categorical
determination
that
election
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
must
be
re
evaluate
in
light
of
the
supreme
court
ruling
in
loper
the
statutory
language
of
the
cea
do
not
explicitly
preclude
all
such
contract
and
thus
each
category
should
be
examine
with
a
nuanced
understanding
of
its
potential
benefit
and
risk
instead
of
responsibly
regulate
these
new
market
the
commission
plan
to
ban
a
broad
range
of
they
a
blanket
ban
on
certain
event
contract
misinterpret
the
cea
which
require
a
two
step
process
first
determine
if
a
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
and
second
assess
whether
it
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
propose
rule
bypass
this
two
step
process
financial
regulation
should
rely
on
datum
and
law
not
uninformed
preconception

such
sweeping

moreover
the

the

ban
most

without

judicial
interpretation
give
that
the
court
be
now
the
final
arbiter
of
statutory
interpretation
with
the
overturning
of
the
chevron
doctrine
the
cftc
must
ensure
that
its
regulation
be
defensible
under
judicial
scrutiny
this
include
provide
clear
evidencebase
justification
for
why
certain
event
contract
should
be
prohibit
and
demonstrate
how
such
prohibition
align
with
the
cea
intent
and
objective
the
cftc
be
neither
a
gambling
nor
an
election
regulator
and
be
not
equip
to
regulate
this
market
whether
the
cftc
have
jurisdiction
over
election
event
contract
require
a
court
determination
as
such
we
recommend
that
the
commission
wait
for
the
conclusion
of
the
lawsuit
with
kalshi
kalshiex
llc
commodity
futures
trading
commission
so
that
a
judge
can
properly
rule
on
statutory
