kalshi
market
be
not
as
vulnerable
to
these
concern
because
kalshi
market
participant
have
powerful
incentive
to
accurately
predict
election
outcome
express
any
other
incentive
would
be
financially
costly
and
adverse

from

have

fourth
concern

be

exaggerated

market
have
little
incentive
to
identify
themselves
to
federal
authority
who
can
quickly
respond
with
civil
or
criminal
sanction
person
interested
in
manipulate
federal
election
will
find
it
far
more
rational
to
launch
social
medium
disinformation
campaign
or
other
form
of
deception
than
to
participate
in
a
contract
market
where
they
must
identify
themselves
and
know
that
their
every
move
be
monitor
by
regulatory
authority
far
because
of
the
ambiguous
relationship
between
turnout
and
perceive
position
in
a
campaign
it
be
far
from
clear
how
person
interested
in
manipulate
an
election
would
participate
in
the
kalshi
market
would
a
person
favor
candidate
x
want
to
inflate
the
probability
that
opponent
y
will
prevail
and
thereby
attempt
to
stimulate
more
x
supporter
to
show
up
at
the
poll
or
would
the
person
favor
candidate
x
want
to
deflate
the
probability
that
opponent
y
will
prevail
in
order
to
dishearten
candidate
y
supporter
and
suppress
opponent
turnout
and
if
market
participant
seek
for
partisan
reason
to
tilt
the
market
one
way
or
another
they
will
be
entirely
unable
to
prevent
counterpartie
from
enter
the
market
to
offset
their
non
market
base
effort
to
influence
kalshi
predictive
estimate
indeed
they
woud
be
create
profitable
trading
strategy
for
their
opponent
hardly
an
outcome
they
would
welcome
the
optimal
strategy
for
a
potential
manipulator
be
thus
far
from
clear
and
this
ambiguity
very
substantially
diminish
concern
that
the
kalshi
market
will
be
use
for
manipulative
purpose
indeed
give
the
ambiguous
electoral
consequence
of
effort
to
influence
pricing
of
the
kalshi
contract
a
person
interested
in
promote
one
candidate
over
another
would
likely
find
it
far
more
rational
simply
to
contribute
to
the
favor
candidate
campaign
where
the
effect
of
the
contribution
be
far
less
ambiguous
fifth
the
electorate
view
of
the
likely
outcome
of
an
election
will
not
be
determine
exclusively
by
the
pricing
of
the
kalshi
contract
voter
retain
access
to
multiple
source
of
predictive
information
as
describe
above
and
will
discount
kalshi
predictive
information
to
the
extent
appropriate
in
light
of
all
other
predictive
information
source
that
be
active
in
the
market
sixth
the
extent
to
which
the
public
be
willing
to
rely
on
the
predictive
information
generate
by
the
kalshi
contract
will
be
codetermine
by
the
level
of
confidence
the
kalshi
contract
generate
in
its
integrity
the
great
the
public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
information
generate
by
the
contract
the
great
the
reliance
the
public
will
place
on
the
contract
and
the
more
valuable
the
contract
to
society
and
to
its
sponsor
the
contract
sponsor
thus
have
intrinsic
incentive
to
operate
the
market
without
bias
or
favor
to
any
side
of
any
contract
and
to
assure
that
the
contract
predictive
result
be
as
unbiased
and
accurate
as
possible
it
be
unclear
that
every
other
voice
in
the
market
for
predictive
information
have
equivalently
neutral
incentive
I
trust
that
these
observation
be
helpful
to
the
commission
in
its
deliberation
and
would
be
happy
to
respond
to
any
inquiry
that
the
agency
might
wish
to
pose
as
part
of
its
deliberative
process

good
regard
