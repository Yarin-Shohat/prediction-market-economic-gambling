to
whom
it
may
concern
I
be
a
lawyer
a
policy
analyst
and
founder
of
the
think
tank
people
policy
project
over
the
last
five
year
my
organization
have
produce
research
and
policy
proposal
on
topic
include
the
welfare
state
climate
change
housing
and
social
ownership
of
wealth
before
start
the
people
policy
project
I
work
at
the
think
tank
demos
my
work
have
be
cite
or
feature
in
almost
every
major
medium
publication
include
the
new
york
times
the
washington
post
and
the
wall
street
journal
I
be
write
this
letter
in
support
of
allow
kalshiex
to
offer
binary
contract
on
which
political
party
will
be
in
control
of
the
congress

I
believe
that
these
contract
serve
two
important
purpose
1
for
the
public
the
trading
of
these
contract
produce
useful
real
time
information
about
the
important
question
of
who
be
likely
to
govern
the
country
in
the
near
future
this
information
be
widely
seek
out
already
which
be
why
many
major
publication
include
the
new
york
times
and
fivethirtyeight
publish
election
forecast
base
on
polling
datum
and
why
hundred
of
article
be
produce
each
election
cycle
prognosticate
about
the
election
outcome
the
imply
probability
produce
by
actual
trader
risk
their
own
money
give
a
separate
insight
into
the
question
that
polling
aggregation
and
punditry
do
not
2
for
individual
these
contract
allow
hedge
against
certain
policy
outcome
that
could
be
important
to
their
personal
finance
while
it
true
that
the
ultimate
policy
outcome
of
a
give
election
outcome
be
not
entirely
certain
candidate
promise
and
the
general
policy
tendency
of
the
party
provide
some
guidance
about
the
direction
policy
will
shift
base
on
who
win
more
narrowly
there
be
hundred
of
thousand
of
individual
who
work
in
and
around
politic
whose
life
circumstance
be
alter
quite
radically
by
political
outcome
it
almost
certainly
true
that
most
of
the
individual
who
would
participate
in
these
future
market
be
not
hedge
against
any
personal
risk
and
just
hop
to
make
money
by
pick
the
right
side
of
a
binary
election
outcome
contract
these
kind
of
participant
be
not
sympathetic
and
enable
this
kind
of
behavior
should
not
be
the
aim
of
public
policy
but
these
participant
be
also
necessary
to
produce
the
valuable
informational
and
hedging
function
of
these
contract
so
these
consideration
need
to
be
balance
against
one
another
and
in
my
view
the
balance
of
consideration
favor
allow
the
contract
lastly
it
be
worth
remember
that
there
be
foreign
bet
market
like
betfair
in
the
uk
where
gambler
include
americans
already
place
wager
on
the
outcome
of
us
election
bring
election
contract
onshore
and
regulate
they
domestically
would
reduce
the
risk
involve
in
this
market
relative
to
the
status
quo
