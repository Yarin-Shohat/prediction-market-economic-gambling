rather
the

the

the

by

imply

by

this

the

proposal
to

therefore
contradict

the

state
the

the

much

establish

fail

standard
to
refute
the

overly
broad

that

there
be
often
an
imbalance
among
those
seek

hedge
gambler
help
to
resolve
this
imbalance
as
their
desire
to
speculate
lead
to
the
injection
of
the
additional
liquidity
need
for
the

2
response
to
commission
proposal
and
question
we
now
address
specific
question
from
the
proposal
1
the
commission
far
request
comment
on
the
example
provide
of
event
contract
that
the
commission
believe
would
generally
fall
outside
of
the
scope
of
cea
section
and
in
particular
the
commission
request
comment
on
the
follow
question
be
there
additional
type
of
event
contract
that
should
be
explicitly
identify
by
the
commission
in
the
non
exclusive
list
of
contract
type
that
would
generally
fall
outside
the
scope
of
cea
section
and
what
index
or
measure
be
other
macroeconomic
or
for
purpose
of
contract
that
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
section
be
tax
rate
corporate
and
capital
gain
tax
rate
among
such
macroeconomic
measure
any
index
or
measure
that
be
correlate
with
a
pre
establish
macroeconomic
index
or
measure
should
be
regard
as
other
macroeconomic
or
for
the
purpose
of
cea
section
this
include
corporate
tax
rate
which
have
be
show
to
be
correlate
with
gdp
growth
in
a
recent
study
by
peterson
et
al
2022
2
the
commission
request
comment
on
all
aspect
of
its
propose
definition
of
the
term
game
in
its
propose
definition
of
game
the
commission
appear
to
bend
over
backwards
to
ensure
that
the
definition
explicitly
include
certain
type
of
event
such
as
sporting
event
election
and
award
show
while
omit
or
leave
ambiguous
a
number
of
other
event
that
should
obviously
also
fall
under
gaming
by
any
common
sense
interpretation
of
the
term
for
example
the
propose
definition
exclude
event
such
as
climate
relate
or
other
natural
occurrence
on
which
stake
something
of
value
would
logically
constitute
gaming
by
its
vernacular
meaning
as
synonymous
with
gambling
at
the
same
time
the
propose
definition
single
out
other
event
such
as
contest
of
other
sport
event
and
political
election
which
be
categorically
indistinguishable
to
the
aforementioned
omit
event
from
the
perspective
of
a
party
uninvolve
in
a
contest
game
or
performance
to
stake
something
of
value
on
such
a
contest
game
or
performance
be
akin
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
natural
event
as
both
category
of
event
be
beyond
the
control
of
the
party
of
the
contract
there
be
no
logical
basis
on
which
the
two
would
be
treat
as
different
with
respect
to
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
it
be
far
worth
highlight
that
eligible
event
contract
so
call
exclude
commodity
be
tacitly
require
by
the
cea
to
involve
event
beyond
the
control
of
the
party
to
the
relevant
contract
agreement
or
transaction
section
of
cea
therefore
the
singling
out
of
contest
of
other
in
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
be
redundant
to
the
eligible
class
of
contract
under
section
by
this
provision
it
be
imply
that
any
event
contract
for
which
one
of
the
party
be
involve
in
a
sporting
event
underlie
the
contract
can
not
be
approve
on
the
other
hand
a
contract
involve
the
same
event
but
between
two
party
who
be
uninvolved
in
that
event
can
and
should
be
approve
per
section
regardless
of
whether
the
contract
be
determined
to
involve
gaming
climate
relate
event
contract
involve
gaming
or
do
involve
game
just
as
much
as
contract
on
election
or
sporting
contest
from
the
commission
perspective
therefore
either
both
should
be
consider
gaming
or
both
should
not
perhaps
the
commission
have
purposely
contort
its
definition
of
gaming
to
exclude
climate
relate
event
because
such
contract
have
gain
the
commission
blessing
for
their
obvious
use
in
hedge
weather
relate
contingency
in
agriculture
and
farming
but
there
be
tangible
circumstance
some
of
which
have
be
highlight
in
section
in
which
market
on
all
of
these
event
climate
sport
and
election
be
useful
for
hedge
risk
and
for
inform
the
public
about
event
in
the
public
interest
regardless
such
observation
about
hedging
be
irrelevant
to
whether
or
not
such
an
activity
involve
gaming
and
herein
lie
the
fundamental
flaw
of
the
commission
propose
definition
an
event
contract
that
involve
gaming
can
nevertheless
be
useful
for
hedge
the
determination
of
whether
a
market
be
useful
for
hedge
risk
be
unrelated
to
whether
or
not
the
market
involve
gaming
and
by
the
same
token
whether
an
activity
involve
gaming
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
a
related
event
contract
can
serve
as
a
vehicle
for
hedge
the
commission
definition
therefore
must
be
rework
to
accurately
reflect
the
common
sense
meaning
of
the
term
game
without
respect
to
whatever
ulterior
motive
the
commission
may
have
in
attempt
to
frame
the
narrative
about
specific
type
of
contract
a
further
problem
with
the
commission
approach
throughout
the
proposal
include
its
handling
of
gaming
be
in
confound
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
with
event
contract
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
relevant
section
of
the
cea
make
clear
that
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
and
those
that
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
not
one
and
the
same
the
act
merely
state
that
the
commission
can
only
disallow
event
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
provide
such
a
contract
be
also
contrary
to
the
public
interest
game
in
itself
be
not
automatically
against
the
public
interest
as
be
clear
by
the
wording
of
the
act
the
fundamental
of
market
function
review
in
section
and
the
mount
datum
of
voter
and
lawmaker
across
the
supermajority
of
state
in
which
sport
betting
have
be
approve
in
recent
year
the
commission
propose
definition
of
gaming
which
purposely
aim
to
include
event
that
it
seek
to
disapprove
and
exclude
event
that
it
wish
to
approve
further
highlight
the
commission
own
misunderstanding
and
misapplication
of
the
act
plainly
an
activity
can
involve
gaming
or
any
other
enumerate
activity
for
that
matter
and
yet
still
be
in
the
public
interest
if
this
be
not
the
case
then
the
legality
of
every
event
contract
market
would
be
in
jeopardy
as
all
event
contract
market
involve
gaming
or
be
similar
to
gaming
to
some
degree
and
such
activity
be
necessary
for
healthy
market
function
see
section
there
be
no
evidence
of
manipulation
or
other
nefarious
us
of
election
event
contract
market
the
commission
raise
a
number
of
specific
concern
about
the
offering
of
event
contract
on
election
outcome
specifically
the
commission
assert
that
such
contract
raise
concern
that
conduct
design
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
could
be
use
to
manipulate
the
market
in
such
contract
or
conversely
that
the
market
in
such
contract
could
be
manipulate
to
influence
election
or
electoral
perception
proposal
54
this
claim
be
a
red
herring
not
support
by
datum
from
active
market
involve
election
bet
over
a
period
of
decade
the
commission
voice
valid
concern
about
influence
in
the
above
quote
but
the
concern
be
misplace
to
the
contrary
election
market
be
the
antidote
to
manipulative
practice
undertake
by
political
party
to
unduly
influence
the
electorate
via
the
medium
and
other
mean
the
fallout
of
the
first
presidential
debate
between
trump
and
biden
on
june
27
2024
underscore
the
point
while
political
operative
within
the
democratic
party
leverage
the
medium
to
control
the
narrative
the
election
market
on
predictit
betfair
polymarket
and
other
outlet
give
the
public
an
insight
into
what
be
actually
happen
and
what
it
mean
for
the
upcoming
election
it
be
the
lack
of
election
market
rather
than
their
existence
that
enable
widespread
manipulation
and
undue
influence
of
the
electorate
in
addition
to
iowa
electronic
market
iem
and
predictit
both
of
which
have
operate
under
cftc
no
action
relief
election
betting
be
offer
by
a
number
of

some
of
whom
operate
unregulated
or
outside
the
united
states
a
non
exhaustive
list
include
intrade
smarket
betfair
and
polymarket
therefore
although
the
commission
have
try
to
limit
public
access
to
political
event
contract
within
its
jurisdiction
such
market
have
exist
and
will
continue
to
thrive
into
the
future
despite
the
commission
attempt
to
prevent
they
notwithstanding
any
legal
or
regulatory
issue
these
market
serve
a
useful
purpose
for
evaluate
the
commission
concern
over
election
market
whatever
allege
opportunity
such
market
would
offer
to
influence
election
or
electoral
perception
would
have
surely
be

through
the

betfair

should

ample

for

or

adverse

reference
by
the
commission
in
its
proposal
the
fact
that
no
such
adverse
event
have
be
observe
over
several
year
of
offer
these
same
market
indicate
that
the
threat
of
such
an
adverse
event
be
negligible
and
do
not
outweigh
the
many
more
significant
public
benefit
of
such
market
the
commission
claim
reason
for
oppose
these
market
be
not
support
by
the
empirical
evidence
gaming
be
not
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
before
address
the
question
below
it
be
important
to
reiterate
several
key
point
from
section
1
the
premise
of
the
commission
proposal
be
flawed
per
the
wording
of
the
cea
gaming
be
not
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
therefore
when
we
respond
to
the
commission
question
below
regard
other
contract
that
constitute
gaming
but
which
fall
outside
the
propose
definition
of
the
term
we
be
by
no
mean
suggest
that
such
event
contract
should
be
consider
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nor
be
we
endorse
the
commission
propose
definition
to
the
contrary
in
recognize
the
many
event
contract
that
should
rightly
fall
under
the
heading
of
gaming
we
call
attention
to
the
flaw
in
the
commission
frankenstein
of
a
definition
of
gaming
and
its
position
that
such
contract
ought
to
be
regard
by
default
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
particular
the
commission
request
comment
on
the
follow
question
be
there
example
of
activity
that
would
constitute
gaming
that
may
fall
outside
of
the
propose
definition
for
this
section
we
assume
the
common
sense
definition
of
gaming
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
outcome
by
this
definition
event
contract
relate
to
the
climate
or
weather
would
most
certainly
involve
gaming
but
do
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
propose
definition
as
climate
relate
event
be
natural
event
that
do
not
result
from
a
contest
game
or
performance
therefore
event
contract
involve
the
number
of
hurricane
the
amount
of
annual
rainfall
in
a
specific
location
whether
a
magnitude
earthquake
will
be
detect
in
a
specific
location
damage
cause
by
wildfire
annual
snowfall
and
similar
such
event
be
intuitively
game
but
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
similarly
event
contract
relate
to
price
indice
interest
rate
or
other
macroeconomic
metric
and
indicator
also
involve
gaming
but
be
not
within
the
scope
of
the
propose
definition
regard
this
latter
case
we
note
that
such
price
index
etc
be
specifically
carve
out
for
approval
in
the
cea
this
do
not
however
preclude
they
from
involve
game
the
cea
make
clear
that
gaming
be
not
inherently
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
some
in
fact
many
or
most
event
contract
may
involve
game
to
some
degree
and
yet
still
serve
the
public
interest
other
activity
that
constitute
gaming
but
fall
outside
of
the
propose
definition
be
legislative
outcome
such
as
whether
a
particular
bill
will
pass
the
house
or
senate
or
whether
a
bill
will
be
veto
by
the
president
and
judicial
decision
such
as
whether
a
specific
justice
will
be
in
the
majority
of
a
specific
supreme
court
decision
or
how
a
court
will
rule
in
a
specific
case
unless
the
commission
strain
its
definition
even
far
to
regard
the
passing
of
legislation
or
a
judicial
ruling
as
the
result
of
a
contest
they
be
proceeding
not
contest
such
event
would
be
exclude
from
the
definition
and
yet
to
stake
something
of
value
on
these
would
constitute
gaming
under
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
term
to
be
clear
the
offering
of
such
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
just
as
the
offering
of
contract
on
election
sport
and
other
contest
be
in
the
public
interest
the
omission
of
such
event
from
the
commission
propose
definition
of
gaming
underscore
a
deficiency
of
the
commission
propose
definition
rather
than
call
into
question
the
validity
of
market
involve
such
event
be
there
other
type
of
vote
or
election
that
the
commission
should
specifically
identify
for
clarity
in
the
illustrative
example
in
propose
what
type
of
other
vote
or
election
should
be
identify
and
why
no
in
fact
the
illustrative
example
specify
in
propose
should
be
remove
as
they
unjustifiably
disregard
specific
event
contract
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
the
availability
at
gaming
venue
of
bet
or
wager
on
a
particular
contingency
occurrence
or
event
be
a
relevant
factor
in
the
commission
consideration
of
whether
an
event
contract
involve
that
contingency
occurrence
or
event
involve
game
for
purpose
of
no
the
availability
of
wager
at
gaming
venue
be
irrelevant
to
the
commission
consideration
as
the
commission
decision
be
govern
by
the
cea
and
the
availability
of
wager
at
specific

be
govern
by
other
law
and

which
may
be
incongruent
with
the
act
in
various

however
the

of
such

at

should
be

relevant
for
determine
whether

on
such

be
in

widespread
opportunity
to

be
strong
evidence
that

this
question
be

pose
and
can
not

appropriately
address
until
such
a
judicial

be
to
take

as
the
reasoning

the
decision
to

would
likely
be
material
to
the
determination
of
whether

however
it
be
worth
pose
the
obvious
question
if
the

could
disqualify
political
event
contract
on
ground
of
be
similar
to

then
what
event

could
survive
the
ever
widen

of
the

definition
of

and
its
all
encompass
criterion
for

broadly
define
all

involve
the

of

money
on

of
some

as

may
not

a

game
or
performance
there
be
many
contract
that
technically
do
not
fall
within
the
commission
propose
definition
of
gaming
but
if
similar
to
gaming
be
take
to
mean
risk
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
outcome
then
all
event
contract
must
be
consider

include
the
various
legacy
commodity
and
future
contract
that

currently

the
end
result
be

be
at

of
a
fickle

body
3
the

may
also
consider
whether
it
should
enumerate

involve

or
some

thereof
as

involve
a

to
any

or
more
of

terrorism
assassination
or

that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or

under

and
determine
that

if
so
should
the
commission
determine
such

be
contrary

this
question
once
again
highlight
the
problem
with
the

proposal
to
classify
all

as

by

political
contract
do
not
in

involve

but
any
give
political

very
well
may
involve

even
so
the

of

or
activity
that

under

in

contract
do
not
on
its
own
justify
a
determination
that
such
a

be
contrary
to
the

under
specific
circumstance
the
outcome
of
a
presidential
or
congressional
election
may
well
have
implication
for
the
declaration
of
war
or
the
likelihood
of
a
terrorist
attack
but
such
implication
do
not
on
their
own
raise
a
public
interest
concern
and
it
be
a
stretch
to
conclude
that
such
an
outcome
involve
war
or
terrorism
in
any
material
way
as
discuss
below
in
response
to
the
relevant
question
contract

be
not
inherently
against

should
not
be
categorically
disallow

ground

the

comment

the

provide
no

the

request
comment
on
all
aspect
of
its
propose
public

determination
with
respect
to
contract
involve
terrorism

in
particular
the
commission
request
comment
on
whether
there
be
contract
that
may
involve

assassination

that
do
not
raise
the
above

concern
why

why
not
there
be

surround
contract

but
such
sensitivity
should
be
deal
with
appropriately
not
by
simply
throw
up
one
hand
and
regulate
an
entire
class
of
contract
out
of
existence
as
the
commission
propose
to
do
an
event
contract
on
the
assassination
of
a
specific
person
would
not
be
an
exclude
commodity
under
the
cea
because
any
of
the
participant
in

a

would
conceivably
have
some
control
over
whether
such
an

occur
such
a

would
not

eligible
for

under

similar
such
issue
arise
for
contract
involve
assassination
of
specified
member
of

or
the

such
contract
would
raise
public
interest
concern
but
such
contract
be
not
within
the
purview
of
the
commission
proposal
as
they
do
not
fit
within
the
definition
of

under

with
that
say
contract

assassination

do
not
as
a
category
raise
the
above
describe
public

concern
the
reason
be
articulate
throughout

and
highlight
again
here
for
emphasis
as
long
as
the
underlying
event
be
it
war
assassination
or
terrorism
be
outside
the
control
of
the

contract
participant
it
be
an
exclude
commodity
that
be
eligible
for
consideration
under
the
cea
in
order
to
prohibit
such
a
contract
the
commission
must
explicitly
determine
that
it
be
contrary
to
the

as
case
study

in

show
there
be

in

while
the

the

whether

from
devastating
event
there
be
nothing
any
single
participant
can
do
to
advance
that
outcome
the
spread
of
covid
be
beyond
the
control
of
any
one
individual
one
person
can
not
cause
to
become
a
global
pandemic
so
while
it
may
not
sit
well
with
the
commission
that
a
person
could
profit
from
such
a
devastating
event
the
potential
public
benefit
of
such
a
market
which
be
enjoy
by
hundred
of
million
of
americans
far
outweigh
these
otherwise
isolate
concern
as
the
commission
be
also
surely
aware
such
widespread
public
benefit
of
market
can
not
be
realize
without
the
possibility
that
some
participant
will
profit
at
the
expense
of
other
that
simply
how
and
why
market
work
as
they
do
the
potential
negative
consequence
of
such
market
be
isolate
to
individual
participant
whereas
the
potential
positive
benefit
be
widespread
for
an
event
such
as
the
covid
pandemic
the
commission
overlook
the
possibility
that
such
a
market
could
mitigate
or
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
very
event
it
concern
suppose
for
example
that
the
market
under
consideration
above
concern
whether
who
will
declare
covid
a
pandemic
trade
at
for
yes
as
of
january
2020
note
that
this
be
a
purely
hypothetical
price
scenario
because
this
market
have
not
yet
be
offer
at
the
time
it
be
impossible
to
know
what
the
market
price
would
have
be
as
of
january
2020
at
the
same
time
the
official
announcement
of
the
government
insist
that
the
threat
to
the
general
public
be
low
not
until
mid
march
do
the
government
take
action
to
stop
the
spread
of
within
the
if
such
a
market
be
to
exist
in
january
2020
however
the
general
public
would
have
have
an
outlet
for
obtain
more
accurate
information
two
month
before
the
delayed
government
response
thank
to
the
information
aggregate
by
such
a
market
ten
or
hundred
of
thousand
of
covid
death
could
have
be
prevent
such
a
possibility
raise
an
important
question
for
the
commission
do
the
potential
of
save
hundred
of
thousand
or
million
of
life
not
outweigh
senator
lincoln
concern
that
some
participant
might
gamble
through
future
market
or
profit
from
a
devastating
event
the
same
rationale
apply
to
the
consideration
of
whether
other
market
on
war
assassination
terrorism
etc
should
be
permit
be
the
stability
afford
by
enable
business
to
hedge
against
the
inevitable
instability
of
such
an
event
not
in

public
interest
be
the
efficiency
and
accuracy
of
information
transmit
through
such
market
about
event
of
grave
national
and
international
importance
not
in
the
public

do
the
possibility
of
preserve

if
not

of

in
economic
value
and
hundred
of

not
far
outweigh
the
isolated
and
inconsequential
possibility
that
a

could
profit
from

view
another
way
be
prevent
a

from

from

worth

the

the
above
describe

why

not
the

public

with

be

to
its

contract
do
not

of

moreover
the
public

raise
by

do
not
reflect
the
reality
of

these
concern
be
instead
base
on
hypothetical
scenario
for
which
there
be
no
direct
observation
in
the
various
market
that
exist
and
which
would
fall
under
the
commission
propose
definition
of

public
sentiment
towards
gambling
have
shift
dramatically
since
2010
in
2018
the
supreme
court
overrule
the
professional
and
amateur
sport
protection
act

have
previously
outlaw

exception
since

beyond
sport

gambling
be
currently
legal
in
some
form
in
48
state
all
except
hawaii
and
utah
the
commission
make
frequent
reference
to
the
2010
colloquy
and
in
particular
senator
lincoln
statement
against
gambling
through
future
market
at
the
time
of
senator
lincoln
statement
sport
betting
be
illegal
nationwide
due
to
paspa
and
a
reasonable
position
due
to
its
illegality
may
have
be
that
gamble
particularly
on
sport
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
virtue
of
these
law
we
note
however
that
the
oft
cited
quote
to
senator
lincoln
date
to
well
before
the
much
more
recent
and
ongoing
movement
of
gambling
legalization
that
be
sweep
across
the
country
with
the
repeal
of
paspa
sport
betting
be
no
long
illegal
and
state
legislature
have
take
swift
action
to
legalize
sport
bet
within
their
border
as
of
june
2024
a
supermajority
of
state
38
in
total
have
vote
to
legalize
sport
bet
source
so
while
the
public
interest
argument
against
sport
bet
and
related
event
contract
may
have
be
justify
such
an
argument
no
long
pass
muster
as
the
general
public
and
lawmaker
across
38
state
have
make
clear
that
legal
and
regulated
sport
betting
be
in
the
public
interest
to
argue
that
event
contract
on
sporting
contest
be
against
the
public
interest
be
to
argue
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
citizen
be
ill
equip
to
determine
their
own
interest
such
a
task
be
reserve
for
the
five
unelected
cftc
commissioner
gaming
be
not
inherently
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
may
argue
that
market
exist
purely
for
purpose
of
gambling
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
proposal
go
even
far
in
suggest
that
any
contract
deem
to
involve
gaming
or
be
similar
to
gaming
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
datum
reject
the
commission
stance
to
the
contrary
the
fact
that
gambling
be
currently
legal
in
some
form
in
48
state
all
except
hawaii
and
utah
be
an
explicit
expression
by
the
citizen
and
lawmaker
of
those
state
in
the
belief
that
gambling
be
in
the
public
interest
and
as
the
interplay
between
hedger
profiteer
and
gambler
describe
in
section
make
clear
some
amount
of
gambling
be
essential
to
the
healthy
function
of
market
on
that
note
by
the
commission
own
draconian
stance
all
of
its
currently
approve
market
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
all
of
its
market
somehow
involve
gambling
or
something
similar
the
market
could
not
operate
otherwise
the
proclivity
and
motivation
of
specific
event
contract
participant
can
not
be
use
to
evaluate
whether
that
contract
serve
the
public
interest
overall
when
consider
whether
a
particular
event
contract
serve
the
public
interest
the
totality
of
market
dynamic
must
be
take
into
account
additional
response
to
the
commission
treatment
of
gaming
below
we
address
several
specific
claim
make
by
the
commission
about
gaming
as
such
the
commission
believe
that
contract
involve
such
occurrence
be
likely
to
be
trade
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
use
predominantly
by
speculator
or
participant
not
have
a
commercial
or
hedge
interest
and
can
not
reasonably
expect
to
be
use
for
hedge
price
base
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
50
an
important
attribute
of
trading
in
general
and
event
contract
trading
in
particular
be
that
market
participant
buyer
and
seller
do
not
have
to
explain
why
they
choose
to
buy
and
sell
this
aspect
of
market
participation
be
critical
to
the
efficient
and
effective
function
of
market
as
explain
in
section
market
participant
do
not
declare
their
motivation
for
trading
but
the
existence
of
trader
from
diverse
background
with
divergent
motivation
be
essential
for
market
to
serve
their
primary
purpose
for
hedge
risk
and
aggregate
information
on
what
basis
then
do
the
commission
conclude
that
broad
class
of
contract
would
be
trade
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
can
not
reasonably
expect
to
be
use
for
hedge
price
base
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
the
commission
continue
moreover
the
commission
believe
that
an
individual
or
entity
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
may
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequence
may
also
be
more
likely
to
have
access
to
information
influence
that
could
be
use
to
engage
in
activity
that
could
artificially
move
the
market
in
an
event
contract
involve
such
occurrence
potentially
raise
heighten
manipulation
concern
for
example
a
professional
athlete
or
coach
may
be
economically
impact
by
their
team
win
or
loss
but
may
also
have
access
to
information
for
example
about
a
team
member
health
or
a
potential
injury
that
could
be
use
to
trade
ahead
of
the
market
in
an
event
contract
involve
the
team
performance
furth
the
athlete
or
coach
would
potentially
have
a
platform
for
example
access
to
medium
combine
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regard
the
team
that
could
be
use
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
there
be
no
evidence
that
such
attempt
at
manipulation
be
in
any
way
widespread
as
the
research
literature
have
demonstrate
the
few
document
attempt
to
manipulate
election
market
have
in
fact
only
serve
to
make
those
market
more
resilient
see

work
by
rhode
and

such
be
the
nature
of

and
also
by

see

the

go
to

which
highlight
so
call
insider
trading
concern
be
a
red
herring
as
it
do
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
relevant
section
of
the
cea
as
it
be
a
requirement
that
the
event
be
beyond
the
control
of
party
of
the
event
contract
such
participant
would
not
be
eligible
to
trade
contract
on
such
event
and
such
a
circumstance
be
not
within
the
purview
of
the
relevant
section
of
the
cea
on
event
contract
the
commission
far
note
that
most
contract
fall
within
the
propose
definition
of

would
have
no

with

rather
price

information
be

while
decrease
the
ability

the
above
claim
be
hard
to
address
because
to
quote
physicist
wolfgang
pauli
they
be
not
even

in

these

be
so
off

that
it

but
here
be
an

the

core
claim
the

the

indeed
the
point
raise
as
concern
by
the
commission
be
in
fact
reason
for
why
such
market
offer
value
and
should
exist
regulate
robust
market
be
most
valuable
in
the
situation
that
the
commission
describe
when
there
be
opaque
information
from
potentially
unreliable
source
a
specific
point
make
by
the
commission
be
worth
single
out
the
commission
call
out
the
existence
of
only
unregulated
source
of
price
form
information
as
a
reason
for
why
such
market
should
continue
to
be
unregulate
first
if
the
commission
concern
over
unregulated
market
be
valid
then
it
could
easily
counteract
this
concern
by
approve
such
market
for
regulation
second
as
such
unregulated
market
be
govern
by
the
same
self
regulate
dynamic
as
those
describe
in
section
the
commission
concern
over
price
signal
derive
from
unregulated
market
be
unfounded
in
fact
unregulated
market
can
often
produce
more
reliable
price
signal
than
their
regulate
counterpart
which
can
often
suffer
from
market
distortion
cause
by
over
regulation
and
rogue
regulation
of
which
the
commission
proposal
be
a
prime
example
3
concluding
remark
the
commission
proposal
be
riddle
with
fundamental
error
about
event
contract
market
dynamic
and
the
various
way
in
which
event
contract
market
serve
the
public
interest
instead
of
consult
datum
and
pay
deference
to
the
public
interest
benefit
of
market
the
commission
be
hang
up
on
remote
hypothetical
scenario
oft
cite
but
rarely
observe
and
never
witness
to
any
consequential
extent
the
commission
raise
concern
about
election
market
highlight
their
potential
for
misuse
and
abuse
if
approve
but
bet
market
on
election
already
exist
at
scale
see
above
discussion
on
betfair
and
none
of
the
concern
posit
by
the
commission
have
come
to
light
election
be
not
unduly
influence
by
market
manipulator
and
nefarious
actor
on
betfair
or
any
other
exchange
election
be
instead
unduly
influence
by
political
operative
whose
self
serve
narrative
be
allow
to
spread
through
the
medium
unchecke
against
the
signal
of
an
independent
objective
event
contract
market
like
election
the
proliferation
of
legal
state
regulate
sport
betting
have
not
result
in
massive
scandal
to
the
degree
the
commission
project
nor
have
such
scandal
arise
from
market
offer
on
any
other
topic
relate
to
any
of
the
enumerate
activity
there
be
however
well
document
instance
in
which
these
market
have
serve
legitimate
public
benefit
use
case
as
detail
throughout
the
above
discussion
and
in
section
and
in
particular
so
while
the
commission
proposal
paint
a
grim
picture
of
a
world
in
which
event
contract
market
be
widely
use
to
manipulate
and
unduly
influence
the
public
such
a
world
be
pure
fantasy
cook
up
in
the
mind
of
commissioner
grasp
for
a
justification
to
starve
the
general
public
of
the
important
benefit
promise
by
market
on
election
sport
war
public
health
national
security
matter
and
numerous
other
topic
in
the
public
interest
all
available
datum
and
evidence
which
be
cite
throughout
the
above
comment
and
be
plentiful
support
the
opposite
conclusion
that
event
contract
by
and
large
serve
the
public
interest
with
few
isolated
exception
in
propose
to
categorically
disqualify
entire
class
of
obviously
beneficial
contract
on
significant
event
in
the

the
benefit

do
the

indeed
this
be
precisely
how
and
why

negative

that
be

and

the

do
not
advocate

as
the
commission
proposal
would
be
accurately
describe
as
a

and
as
a
matter
of
logic
the

must
be
reject

replace
by
a
more
thoughtful
and
even
