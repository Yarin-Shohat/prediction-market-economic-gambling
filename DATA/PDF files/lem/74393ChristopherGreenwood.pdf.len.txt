kalshiex
request
for
approval
of
political
future
contract
dear
cftc
in
summary
the
kalshiex
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
and
should
be
approve
without
delay
the
current
cftc
should
have
the
courage
to
correct
the
decade
old
nadex
mistake
from
a
previous
set
of
commissioner
and
approve
these
contract
election
have
economic
consequence
the
contract
can
be
use
by
those
expose
to
energy
and
tax
policy
to
hedge
the
contract
serve
a
public
purpose
of
information
production
and
be
likely
to
be
well
than
poll
the
contract
pose
no
risk
of
undermine
election
integrity
the
long
stand
existence
of
academic
prediction
market
with
zero
criminal
sanction
be
a
de
facto
demonstration
that
such
market
be
legal
even
if
one
could
construe
this
as
game
the
cftc
should
use
its
exemptive
authority
to
approve
the
contract
because
they
be
in
the
public
interest
the
cftc
should
approve
these
contract
immediately
and
not
wait
until
october
background
many
year
ago
a
previous
set
of
cftc
commissioner
incorrectly
say
no
to
a
nadex
request
to
trade
election
future
contract
on
the
ground
that
such
contract
be
game
and
thus
illegal
now
kalshi
be
seek
to
trade
contract
that
would
allow
user
to
speculate
on
or
hedge
on
the
result
of
election
the
cftc
be
request
comment
on
various
question
relate
to
these
contract
mostly
relate
to
whether
or
not
the
propose
contract
be
relate
to
game
the
supreme
court
be
not
hang
up
on
stare
decisis
and
the
cftc
should
not
be
either
as
the
recent
overturning
of
roe
v
wade
indicate
the
supreme
court
be
willing
to
overturn
precedent
when
a
majority
of
the
justice
feel
a
mistake
have
be
make
today
commissioner
of
the
cftc
should
also
have
the
courage
to
undo
the
previous
mistake
that
be
make
in
deny
election
base
contract
yes
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
do
provide
important
predictability
and
stability
in
law
and
rulemake
however
with
a
decade
of
additional
consideration
it
be
now
clear
that
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
allow
these
contract
to
exist
the
current
cftc
commissioner
should
not
feel
bind
by
an
incorrect
precedent
make
by
a
previous
generation
of
commissioner
election
have
consequence
and
election
contract
can
provide
a
means
to
hedge
they
we
live
in
a
politically
polarize
world
the
two
major
party
have
very
different
policy
objective
election
outcome
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
economic
success
or
failure
of
an
enterprise
for
example
one
party
want
to
promote
clean
energy
and
the
other
party
want
to
promote
carbon
base
fuel
those
with
exposure
to
fossil
fuel
or
to
green
energy
company
might
want
to
hedge
their
exposure
with
the
propose
contract
the
different
party
also
have
very
different
idea
on
tax
policy
and
once
again
individual
and
corporation
might
want
to
hedge
with
these
contract
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
provide
these
hedging
tool
it
remain
to
be
see
how
much
liquidity
these
contract
will
have
which
will
affect
their
fitness
of
purpose
for
hedge
even
if
the
contract
be
not
big
enough
for
exxon
to
use
for
hedge
they
will
still
have
serious
utility
for
small
investor
the
cftc
should
let
it
up
to
the
dcms
to
design
and
self
certify
the
contract
and
restrain
from
the
urge
to
micromanage
contract
design
the
dcms
have
the
incentive
to
get
it
right
and
the
cftc
should
allow
they
to
experiment
in
each
election
cycle
well
information
about
likely
election
outcome
be
in
the
public
interest
it
be
no
secret
that
public
opinion
poll
have
become
less
trust
in
recent
year
as
people
be
less
likely
to
answer
the
phone
see
nevertheless
there
be
a
large
hunger
for
information
about
what
voter
be
likely
to
do
well
information
can
help
candidate
and
party
well
allocate
their
campaign
resource
well
information
can
also
help
voter
make
voting
and
donate
decision
well
information
can
allow
the
medium
to
make
more
inform
decision
about
how
to
cover
candidate
for
example
access
to
the
platform
of
a
political
debate
have
be
base
on
poll
number
see
with
well
information
from
prediction
market
well
decision
can
be
make
the
information
that
an
election
be
close
can
increase
voter
interest
and
turnout
thus
increase
voter
engagement
in
the
election
process
similarly
the
real
time
nature
of
prediction
market
can
give
voter
and
candidate
nearly
instant
information
about
the
impact
of
various
event
on
a
campaign
such
an
improvement
in
information
be
in
the
public
interest
market
can
do
a
well
job
than
pollster
because
of
their
inherent
financial
incentive
potential
voter
have
no
incentive
to
answer
a
call
from
a
pollster
or
even
tell
the
truth
about
their
voting
intention
this
add
a
large
amount
of
uncertainty
to
poll
result
market
on
the
other
hand
provide
a
strong
financial
incentive
for
people
to
put
their
money
where
their
information
be
profit
drive
player
will
use
all
of
the
information
at
their
disposal
to
make
good
trading
decision
and
this
allow
market
to
aggregate
all
of
the
information
that
be
available
this
mean
that
election
market
be
likely
to
provide
more
accurate
forecast
than
poll
well
information
can
improve
election
integrity
conspiracy
theory
often
fly
when
election
result
differ
from
pre
election
poll
voter
rightly
ask
how
do
my
candidate
lose
when
they
be
lead
in
the
poll
with
well
forecast
of
likely
outcome
voter
be
more
likely
to
accept
the
final
election
result
as
the
election
market
aggregate
all
of
the
available
information
they
be
likely
to
provide
more
accurate
forecast
of
the
final
result
and
thus
help
to
assure
voter
of
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
there
be
no
financial
incentive
to
manipulate
a
regulated
prediction
market
to
change
the
election
outcome
one
concern
be
whether
bad
actor
might
attempt
to
manipulate
a
prediction
market
in
order
to
create
momentum
for
their
candidate
and
influence
the
election
that
would
be
a
stupid
thing
for
anyone
to
do
give
the
highly
regulate
nature
of
cftc
regulate
exchange
the
existence
of
a
high
quality
audit
trail
make
it
very
easy
to
identify
any
such
manipulation
it
would
be
far
more
cost
effective
for
a
manipulator
to
hire
an
army
of
social
medium
bot
than
to
attempt
to
manipulate
an
election
via
a
prediction
market
the
longstanding
existence
of
various
election
prediction
market
be
de
facto
evidence
that
such
market
be
not
illegal
gaming
prediction
market
have
exist
for
many
year
that
harness
market
force
to
predict
election
outcome
for
example
the
iowa
electronic
market
have
be
in
operation
for
over
30
year
see
another
example
be
the
long
stand
operation
of
such
election
prediction
market
be
strong
evidence
that
election
base
prediction
market
be
not
illegal
under
state
of
federal
law
election
be
not
chance
event
gambling
typically
involve
some
outcome
that
be
essentially
random
and
upon
which
the
rule
of
probability
apply
example
include
the
spin
of
a
roulette
wheel
the
roll
of
dice
or
the
drawing
of
a
card
from
a
well
shuffle
deck
such
random
activity
provide
little
if
any
economic
benefit
beyond
entertainment
due
to
the
damage
that
compulsive
gambler
do
to
themselves
and
other
gambling
be
highly
restrict
or
regulate
in
most
jurisdiction
election
on
the
other
hand
be
not
base
on
random
draw
one
exception
be
in
the
extremely
rare
case
of
a
tie
in
some
jurisdiction
a
random
process
can
be
use
to
break
the
tie
for
an
example
see
they
be
the
bedrock
of
our
political
process
and
have
an
important
economic
purpose
election
select
the
leader
who
will
be
make
the
important
policy
decision
that
affect
the
economy
uncertainty
be
not
the
same
as
gamble
the
outcome
of
political
election
like
future
weather
pattern
future
crop
price
and
future
metal
price
be
highly
uncertain
the
mere
fact
that
an
outcome
be
uncertain
do
not
mean
that
an
economic
transaction
tie
to
that
uncertain
outcome
be
illegal
gaming
if
that
be
the
case
then
all
future
contract
would
be
connect
to
gaming
and
hence
illegal
even
if
these
contract
could
be
construe
as
game
the
cftc
should
use
its
exemptive
authority
to
approve
these
contract
as
in
the
public
interest
while
these
contract
be
certainly
not
the
type
of
gaming
congress
envision
in
write
the
prohibition
in
section
of
the
cea
one
can
see
how
some
might
think
so
fortunately
congress
have
give
the
cftc
pretty
broad
exemptive
authority
to
act
in
the
public
interest
see
17
cfr
request
for
exemptive
no
action
and
interpretative
letter
it
be
highly
unlikely
that
a
serious
court
challenge
would
occur
if
the
cftc
approve
these
contract
it
be
in
the
public
interest
to
approve
these
contract
and
the
cftc
should
do
so
without
delay
give
the
rapidly
approach
election
the
cftc
should
approve
the
contract
immediately
and
not
wait
until
october
respectfully
submit
