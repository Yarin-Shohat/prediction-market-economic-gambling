I
be
submit
this
public
comment
to
support
kalshi
propose
contract
on
congressional
control
as
a
long
time
investor
in
hundred
of
early
stage
startup
I
know
from
personal
experience
that
congressional
control
have
significant
direct
and
predictable
impact
on
the
risk
exposure
of
small
business
startup
and
their
founder
and
employee
here
be
an
example
of
how
political
control
can
directly
and
predictably
affect
the
risk
that
a
biotech
startup
face
first
the
biotech
company
have
risk
from
fda
appointment
and
priority
which
can
mean
the
difference
between
rapid
approval
of
a
new
treatment
or
a
yearslong
delay
that
can
cost
the
company
resource
and
in
extreme
case
force
the
company
into
bankruptcy
or
a
firesale
the
company
also
face
risk
regard
federal
funding
for
research
additionally
a
congress
pass
a
mammoth
new
bill
may
force
small
business
to
spend
small
fortune
try
to
navigate
the
regulatory
uncertainty
as
the
rulemake
process
play
out
the
risk
of
these
event
be
directly
and
predictably
tie
to
congressional
control
and
election
in
general
and
the
risk
management
tool
for
this
will
be
also
nearly
every
business
we
fund
face
risk
from
congressional
action
in
multiple
way
needless
to
say
then
these
contract
have
legitimate
hedging
use
to
manage
risk
and
be
not
game
congressional
control
be
an
economically
significant
event
that
impact
risk
and
many
company
and
founder
and
employee
genuinely
need
to
hedge
against
the
contract
could
be
use
by
these
company
founder
and
employee
to
manage
their
risk
very
effectively
in
my
experience
many
individual
and
small
business
have
the
sophistication
and
foresight
to
hedge
their
risk
quite
effectively
and
if
the
cftc
approve
these
contract
base
on
my
experience
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
contract
will
be
use
to
hedge
and
manage
risk
I
would
not
be
write
this
letter
if
I
be
not
confident
that
this
contract
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
contract
be
obviously
not
the
only
economic
exposure
that
small
business
and
individual
have
to
election
as
I
just
illustrate
there
be
already
significant
exposure
to
election
these
contract
would
actually
help
manage
their
exist
risk
as
an
add
advantage
the
price
of
the
contract
represent
the
good
wisdom
of
the
crowd
estimate
of
the
probability
of
a
give
party
win
the
election
this
datum
can
be
highly
valuable
to
small
business
try
to
make
plan
about
the
future
and
wonder
about
the
expect
future
path
of
federal
policy
but
also
to
researcher
who
be
try
to
estimate
the
effect
of
one
party
agenda
on
various
financial
and
economic
variable
it
thus
seem
to
I
that
the
risk
be
minimal
and
largely
speculative
whereas
the
benefit
be
real
and
large
the
cftc
would
be
remiss
to
miss
this
opportunity
to
bring
this
socially
valuable
activity
to
american
soil
