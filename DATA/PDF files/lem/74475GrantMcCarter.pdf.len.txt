I
be
write
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
propose
rule
on
event
contract
I
believe
the
proposal
be
flawed
for
several
reason
which
I
want
to
outline
below
overly
broad
definition
of
game
the
propose
rule
definition
of
gaming
be
excessively
broad
and
risk
restrict
legitimate
contract
from
be
list
for
trading
by
categorize
a
wide
array
of
activity
under
the
term
gaming
include
political
contest
and
athletic
event
the
proposal
could
inadvertently
stifle
innovation
and
limit
the
availability
of
contract
that
have
significant
commercial
value
and
utility
the
broad
scope
of
this
definition
fail
to
consider
the
legitimate
economic
purpose
that
such
contract
may
serve
potentially
hinder
market
participant
from
engage
in
beneficial
trading
activity
the
cftc
definition
of
gaming
include
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
outcome
relate
to
contest
game
involve
skill
or
chance
and
other
occurrence
connect
to
such
event
this
expansive
interpretation
could
lead
to
the
exclusion
of
contract
that
be
not
inherently
speculative
or
harmful
but
rather
serve
as
valuable
tool
for
hedging
and
risk
management
in
various
sector
for
instance
contract
base
on
political
event
or
sport
outcome
could
provide
market
participant
with
opportunity
to
hedge
against
uncertainty
in
these
area
which
be
a
legitimate
economic
activity
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
criterion
be
use
to
determine
the
inclusion
of
certain
activity
under
the
definition
of
gaming
and
how
do
these
criterion
align
with
the
economic
purpose
these
contract
may
serve
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
differentiate
between
contract
that
be
genuinely
speculative
or
harmful
and
those
that
serve
legitimate
hedging
or
risk
management
purpose
3
what
measure
will
the
cftc
implement
to
ensure
that
the
definition
of
gaming
do
not
inadvertently
stifle
innovation
or
limit
the
development
of
contract
that
could
benefit
the
market
and
its
participant
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
contract
that
would
be
consider
legitimate
under
the
propose
rule
to
clarify
the
boundary
of
the
gaming
definition
by
address
these
question
the
cftc
can
provide
great
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
support
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restrict
beneficial
trading
activity
arbitrary
and
capricious
public
interest
consideration
the
cftc
proposal
on
event
contract
introduce
a
problematic
approach
to
public
interest
consideration
by
prohibit
contract
base
on
a
predetermined
finding
that
they
be
against
the
public
interest
without
a
thorough
review
of
their
actual
term
this
blanket
prohibition
on
contract
involve
certain
activity
such
as
game
war
or
terrorism
create
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
regulatory
environment
by
not
allow
for
a
case
by
case
analysis
of
the
specific
term
and
economic
implication
of
each
contract
the
rule
could
lead
to
unjust
outcome
and
deter
market
participant
from
propose
or
list
event
contract
that
might
otherwise
be
beneficial
the
proposal
stipulate
that
contract
involve
certain
enumerate
activity
be
categorically
deem
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
prohibit
from
trading
or
clearing
on
cftc
register
derivative
exchange
this
approach
introduce
significant
uncertainty
for
exchange
and
market
participant
as
it
do
not
account
for
the
specific
economic
purpose
or
pricing
utility
of
individual
contract
the
cftc
rationale
be
to
reduce
the
internal
resource
devote
to
review
event
contract
but
this
come
at
the
cost
of
potentially
stifle
innovation
and
limit
market
opportunity
the
categorical
prohibition
without
a
detailed
analysis
of
each
contract
term
and
implication
can
lead
to
outcome
that
be
not
align
with
the
actual
risk
or
benefit
pose
by
these
contract
this
approach
may
also
discourage
market
participant
from
propose
new
contract
due
to
the
regulatory
risk
and
uncertainty
introduce
by
such
broad
prohibition
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
criterion
and
rationale
do
the
cftc
use
to
determine
that
certain
category
of
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
without
review
the
specific
term
of
each
contract
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
approach
do
not
inadvertently
deter
beneficial
contract
that
serve
legitimate
hedging
or
risk
management
purpose
3
what
mechanism
if
any
will
the
cftc
implement
to
allow
for
a
case
by
case
review
of
contract
that
fall
under
the
enumerate
activity
to
avoid
arbitrary
and
capricious
outcome
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
contract
that
would
be
consider
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
propose
rule
and
explain
the
reasoning
behind
these
determination
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
the
need
to
reduce
internal
resource
allocation
with
the
need
to
foster
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
that
support
innovation
and
economic
growth
by
address
these
question
the
cftc
can
provide
great
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
support
a
balanced
and
effective
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restrict
beneficial
trading
activity
lack
of
clear
public
interest
factor
the
cftc
proposal
lack
clear
public
interest
factor
that
would
determine
whether
a
contract
be
consider
against
the
public
interest
this
absence
of
transparency
and
specificity
in
the
rulemake
process
leave
market
participant
uncertain
about
the
criterion
use
to
evaluate
contract
without
well
define
factor
the
rule
introduce
unnecessary
regulatory
risk
and
uncertainty
which
can
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
development
and
listing
of
event
contract
market
participant
need
clear
guidance
to
understand
how
their
contract
will
be
assess
and
to
ensure
compliance
with
regulatory
standard
the
proposal
mention
several
factor
that
the
cftc
may
consider
in
determine
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
as
the
contract
utility
for
hedging
and
price
basing
purpose
its
potential
impact
on
the
public
good
and
whether
it
involve
activity
deem
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
however
these
factor
be
not
clearly
define
or
consistently
apply
lead
to
ambiguity
for
instance
the
cftc
have
historically
use
an
economic
purpose
test
to
evaluate
contract
but
this
be
remove
by
congress
and
there
be
no
long
a
statutory
requirement
for
contract
to
meet
a
hedging
or
price
basing
standard
the
lack
of
clear
guideline
leave
market
participant
guess
about
how
their
contract
will
be
judge
which
could
deter
innovation
and
the
introduction
of
potentially
beneficial
contract
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
public
interest
factor
will
the
cftc
use
to
evaluate
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
how
will
these
factor
be
consistently
apply
across
different
type
of
contract
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
the
evaluation
process
be
transparent
and
provide
sufficient
guidance
to
market
participant
about
the
criterion
use
in
determine
the
public
interest
3
will
the
cftc
consider
reinstate
the
economic
purpose
test
or
similar
criterion
to
provide
a
more
structured
framework
for
assess
the
public
interest
of
contract
and
if
not
why
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
contract
that
have
be
deem
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
propose
rule
and
explain
the
specific
factor
that
lead
to
these
determination
5
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participant
and
gather
feedback
on
the
public
interest
factor
potentially
through
roundtable
or
public
consultation
to
ensure
that
the
rule
support
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
now
I
want
to
make
clear
the
benefit
of
these
market
that
the
cftc
overlook
in
their
proposal
hedging
use
case
the
cftc
propose
rule
on
event
contract
particularly
those
relate
to
election
pose
significant
challenge
to
the
legitimate
hedge
use
case
that
these
contract
provide
event
contract
offer
a
vital
mechanism
for
business
and
individual
to
hedge
against
uncertainty
associate
with
election
which
have
profound
impact
on
economic
and
regulatory
environment
the
ability
to
hedge
these
risk
be
crucial
for
effective
risk
management
by
prohibit
such
contract
the
cftc
inadvertently
push
market
participant
towards
unregulated
and
potentially
illegal
platform
like
polymarket
a
regulated
market
provide
transparency
security
and
oversight
ensure
that
hedging
activity
be
conduct
within
a
safe
and
compliant
framework
the
cftc
should
focus
on
create
a
robust
regulatory
environment
that
allow
these
contract
to
be
trade
legally
and
transparently
rather
than
drive
they
underground
the
cftc
current
stance
as
reflect
in
recent
order
and
discussion
suggest
that
event
contract
relate
to
election
do
not
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
due
to
their
binary
nature
and
the
unpredictability
of
election
outcome
however
this
perspective
overlook
the
broad
economic
impact
that
election
result
can
have
affect
industry
market
and
individual
financial
position
market
participant
such
as
medium
company
and
consultancy
may
find
significant
value
in
hedge
against
the
direct
risk
stem
from
electoral
outcome
the
cftc
role
should
not
be
to
deny
market
participant
the
choice
of
financial
product
that
meet
their
hedging
need
simply
because
they
be
deem
not
effective
enough
by
the
commission
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
criterion
do
the
cftc
use
to
determine
the
hedge
utility
of
event
contract
and
how
do
it
account
for
the
broad
economic
impact
of
election
outcome
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
approach
do
not
inadvertently
push
market
participant
towards
unregulated
platform
thereby
increase
systemic
risk
3
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participant
to
well
understand
their
hedging
need
and
the
potential
utility
of
event
contract
in
meet
those
need
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
event
contract
that
have
be
deem
to
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
and
explain
the
rationale
behind
these
determination
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
its
concern
about
the
commoditization
of
the
electoral
process
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participant
with
legitimate
hedging
tool
forecasting
and
datum
the
data
generate
from
prediction
market
be
invaluable
and
often
more
accurate
than
traditional
polling
method
numerous
study
have
demonstrate
that
prediction
market
offer
unbiased
and
reliable
forecast
make
they
a
superior
tool
for
anticipate
future
event
this
market
base
price
discovery
be
crucial
for
business
and
individual
who
rely
on
accurate
forecast
to
make
informed
decision
by
restrict
event
contract
the
cftc
be
limit
access
to
this
valuable
datum
which
could
otherwise
enhance
decision
make
process
across
various
sector
the
commission
should
recognize
the
importance
of
these
market
in
provide
high
quality
datum
and
consider
how
they
can
be
regulate
to
maximize
their
utility
prediction
market
have
consistently
show
their
ability
to
aggregate
diverse
information
and
opinion
into
a
single
market
base
forecast
that
often
surpass
the
accuracy
of
conventional
method
like
opinion
poll
the
mechanism
of
trading
contract
base
on
the
likelihood
of
future
event
create
a
financial
incentive
for
participant
to
leverage
all
available
information
result
in
a
more
accurate
and
unbiased
forecast
this
be
particularly
valuable
in
area
such
as
election
where
traditional
polling
can
be
subject
to
bias
and
inaccuracy
the
insight
gain
from
prediction
market
can
inform
strategic
decision
in
business
policy
making
and
risk
management
provide
a
competitive
edge
to
those
who
utilize
this
datum
effectively
the
cftc
proposal
to
restrict
event
contract
include
those
relate
to
political
event
undermine
the
potential
benefit
of
these
market
the
commission
concern
about
the
speculative
nature
of
these
contract
and
the
potential
for
market
manipulation
should
be
address
through
robust
regulatory
framework
rather
than
outright
ban
proper
regulation
can
ensure
that
prediction
market
operate
transparently
and
fairly
maintain
their
integrity
while
provide
valuable
datum
to
market
participant
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
what
specific
evidence
do
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
position
that
prediction
market
do
not
provide
valuable
and
reliable
datum
and
how
do
this
compare
to
the
extensive
research
demonstrate
their
forecasting
accuracy
2
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
balance
its
concern
about
speculation
and
market
manipulation
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participant
access
to
high
quality
market
base
datum
3
what
regulatory
measure
can
the
cftc
implement
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
prediction
market
while
allow
they
to
operate
and
provide
valuable
datum
to
business
and
individual
4
can
the
cftc
provide
example
of
successful
regulatory
framework
from
other
jurisdiction
that
have
effectively
manage
the
risk
associate
with
prediction
market
5
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
academic
researcher
and
industry
expert
to
well
understand
the
value
and
potential
of
prediction
market
in
provide
accurate
forecast
cftc
argument
against
event
contract
the
cftc
argument
against
event
contract
lack
empirical
support
and
be
base
on
broad
generalization
the
assertion
that
the
cftc
do
not
want
to
become
an
election
cop
do
not
justify
a
blanket
ban
on
these
market
instead
of
prohibit
event
contract
the
cftc
should
engage
in
the
hard
work
of
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
address
its
concern
while
allow
these
market
to
operate
this
would
involve
set
clear
guideline
and
standard
to
ensure
that
event
contract
be
use
responsibly
and
do
not
undermine
public
interest
a
ban
be
a
simplistic
solution
that
fail
to
address
the
complexity
of
the
issue
and
overlook
the
potential
benefit
of
a
well
regulate
market
give
these
concern
I
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
follow
question
1
how
do
the
cftc
plan
to
accommodate
the
legitimate
hedge
need
of
business
and
individual
if
event
contract
be
prohibit
2
what
specific
datum
or
research
support
the
cftc
position
that
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
how
do
this
compare
to
the
extensive
research
demonstrate
their
forecasting
accuracy
3
what
step
will
the
cftc
take
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
approach
do
not
inadvertently
push
market
participant
towards
unregulated
platform
thereby
increase
systemic
risk
4
how
can
the
cftc
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
allow
event
contract
to
be
trade
in
a
manner
that
address
public
interest
concern
without
resort
to
a
complete
prohibition
I
ask
that
the
cftc
return
answer
to
question
before
move
forward
with
this
significantly
broad
proposal
sincerely
grant
