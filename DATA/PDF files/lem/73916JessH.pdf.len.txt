dear
chairman
on
thursday
june
27
I
along
with
many
other
americans
tune
in
to
watch
a
debate
I
be
dread
with
both
potential
president
so
widely
dislike
my
overall
outlook
on
the
country
future
as
a
whole
and
my
expectation
for
this
specific
debate
be
extremely
low
both
candidate
still
somehow
manage
to
disappoint
I
one
candidate
lie
through
his
tooth
would
answer
question
about
how
to
solve
addiction
and
refuse
to
commit
to
accept
election
result
if
he
lose
he
put
on
a
disgraceful
show
completely
disregard
the
mere
concept
of
honesty
and
make
weird
comment
about
black
job
I
could
never
feel
comfortable
voting
for
this
man
it
be
the
other
candidate
though
who
steal
the
show
and
break
my
heart
he
struggle
to
complete
a
sentence
could
properly
outline
any
cogent
point
and
generally
look
like
someone
on
death
door
while
I
happily
vote
for
this
man
four
year
ago
I
could
never
feel
comfortable
voting
for
he
to
take
charge
of
the
next
four
year
I
end
this
debate
know
that
if
either
of
these
man
be
to
be
elect
in
november
the
country
would
suffer
this
suffering
however
could
take
many
different
form
there
be
also
the
chance
that
another
candidate
would
come
forward
and
completely
change
the
set
of
option
american
citizen
will
face
in
the
face
of
so
many
unknown
and
such
little
hope
I
search
for
solace
the
issue
however
be
where
to
look
for
an
accurate
portrayal
of
what
we
as
a
nation
could
expect
I
could
ask
friend
and
family
but
like
all
americans
these
day
I
know
I
live
in
an
ideological
bubble
and
I
unlikely
to
learn
anything
about
the
nation
feeling
as
a
whole
by
talk
to
people
who
be
inherently
very
similar
to
I
I
could
turn
to
the
medium
who
have
the
mean
to
gather
information
much
more
widely
than
I
can
but
this
be
the
same
media
that
literally
go
to
the
spin
room
a
place
where
surrogate
for
the
candidate
be
give
nearly
free
reign
to
lie
and
obfuscate
whatever
happen
in
the
debate
to
the
american
people
pundit
and
anchor
on
the
major
network
be
much
well
the
modern
practice
of
balance
often
mean
that
the
talk
head
on
tv
be
effectively
partisan
hack
but
this
practice
be
see
as
acceptable
so
long
as
the
network
put
on
a
few
hack
who
be
democrat
and
a
few
who
be
republicans
I
need
a
source
of
information
about
our
nation
future
that
be
limit
to
my
own
ideological
bubble
and
that
be
put
forth
by
an
entity
that
be
incentivize
to
tell
an
interesting
story
or
support
a
specific
view
more
than
it
be
to
convey
the
truth
I
need
a
source
of
information
where
people
predict
thing
about
our
future
be
incentivize
only
to
be
accurate
because
they
must
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
be
I
need
predictit
on
predictit
site
I
see
the
mind
of
the
nation
I
see
a
president
of
the
united
states
having
already
secure
almost
every
delegate
from
his
party
nomination
process
down
to
a
50
probability
of
win
his
own
party
nomination
the
number
go
up
and
down
but
it
never
go
back
up
to
the
pre
debate
number
of
about
85
and
largely
settle
at
about
65
until
july
2
when
it
again
plummet
as
the
party
start
to
abandon
he
I
think
more
about
that
85
number
an
incumbent
president
with
almost
every
delegate
pledge
to
support
he
in
his
party
nomination
process
be
sit
pre
debate
at
under
90
in
a
prediction
market
ask
if
he
would
make
it
across
the
nomination
finish
line
with
under
two
month
to
go
the
market
think
there
be
a
real
chance
about
one
in
six
that
he
would
flame
out
I
have
spend
four
year
discount
that
15
chance
root
in
concern
about
biden
health
as
a
right
wing
conspiracy
theory
I
be
certain
that
if
he
want
it
biden
would
be
a
shoe
in
for
the
nomination
but
have
I
think
about
it
more
seriously
I
might
have
figure
out
that
there
be
a
reason
that
the
market
believe
in
a
15
chance
he
would
be
nominate
I
might
have
realize
the
excuse
I
have
be
make
for
he
he
have
a
stutter
he
just
old
those
video
be
selectively
edit
be
indeed
nothing
more
than
excuse
the
market
with
its
15
be
right
and
I
be
wrong
since
the
reality
check
that
be
the
debate
I
will
be
rely
more
than
ever
on
predictit
market
to
give
I
information
about
where
we
as
a
nation
be
most
likely
head
their
market
be
a
rare
gem
in
that
they
be
able
to
provide
information
that
be
widely
source
and
incentivize
for
accuracy
above
all
else
this
be
what
the
cftc
want
to
take
away
from
americans
this
be
what
they
want
to
deprive
we
of
on
regulate
exchange
the
cftc
have
be
on
a
crusade
to
shut
down
these
market
start
in
2022
when
they
pull
the
predictit
nal
then
when
they
illegally
prevent
kalshi
from
post
their
congressional
market
and
now
with
this
absurd
rulemaking
I
read
the
rule
and
it
make
zero
sense
the
rule
posit
that
election
be
game
and
therefore
deserve
of
a
ban
because
some
people
call
they
contest
and
some
definition
of
gambling
ignore
that
gambling
and
gaming
be
by
no
means
synonyms
use
the
word
contest
this
be
absurd
this
logic
be
so
tortured
that
it
become
painfully
obvious
that
the
cftc
just
want
to
ban
these
market
and
desperately
search
for
a
definition
that
would
do
it
it
be
plainly
clear
that
all
security
and
commodity
be
tie
to
contest
in
some
way
do
anyone
truly
believe
that
tesla
be
in
a
contest
to
sell
more
of
its
car
than
byd
or
that
indonesia
be
in
a
contest
with
australia
to
export
the
most
nickel
to
propose
that
contest
be
game
and
should
therefore
be
ban
would
effectively
ban
all
trading
on
all
security
and
commodity
this
notion
be
utterly
ridiculous
the
rulemake
proposal
also
never
bother
to
address
the
concept
that
game
the
key
word
upon
which
they
be
deeming
market
on
election
bannable
inherently
refer
to
a
game
we
know
from
prior
cftc
document
mostly
the
kalshi
order
that
the
cftc
think
some
event
contract
and
commodity
be
not
game
because
they
have
economic
effect
to
say
that
an
election
be
a
game
and
that
market
on
election
be
game
be
to
say
that
election
do
not
have
economic
effect
this
assertion
be
so
thoroughly
incorrect
that
the
highly
pay
lawyer
and
economist
at
the
cftc
should
be
ashamed
to
put
it
forward
no
reasonable
person
would
believe
that
election
do
have
economic
effect
every
single
campaign
speech
or
party
platform
contain
multiple
example
of
concrete
policy
proposal
that
would
have
major
economic
impact
if
implement
during
the
tragic
debate
on
june
27
I
manage
to
sort
through
some
of
the
incoherent
rambling
and
learn
a
little
bit
about
what
the
two
presidential
candidate
stand
for
biden
talk
about
raise
taxis
on
the
wealthy
to
fund
medicare
and
social
security
trump
talk
about
impose
tariff
on
good
from
china
trump
talk
about
extend
the
2019
tax
cut
biden
talk
about
raise
the
corporate
tax
rate
to
pay
for
childcare
and
eld
care
these
be
clearly
concrete
and
direct
economic
impact
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
a
sister
agency
to
the
cftc
recently
propose
a
rule
that
would
require
table
saw
to
have
the
ability
to
automatically
retract
upon
contact
with
a
finger
I
a
product
engineer
who
regularly
work
with
equipment
like
this
the
cost
of
upgrade
this
equipment
can
run
into
the
hundred
of
dollar
per
device
and
some
company
will
have
hundred
or
even
thousand
of
saw
would
it
be
helpful
if
those
company
could
see
the
odd
that
they
would
have
to
spend
potentially
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
on
new
equipment
and
to
be
able
to
hedge
directly
against
that
possibility
be
this
a
clear
case
of
why
knowledge
about
future
policy
decision
be
important
to
the
public
interest
the
cftc
can
not
deny
that
a
rule
about
table
saw
be
real
and
affect
relevant
business
their
crusade
against
political
event
contract
demonstrate
how
divorced
they
be
from
how
actual
business
work
and
interact
with
regulatory
body
congress
have
outline
a
two
step
process
for
ban
a
contract
1
determine
that
it
be
part
of
an
enumerate
category
and
2
determine
that
it
be
against
public
interest
the
cftc
propose
rule
completely
bulldoze
this
process
by
presume
that
the
cftc
have
the
power
to
rule
a
contract
as
gaming
and
after
do
so
need
not
do
any
of
the
require
analysis
to
classify
it
as
against
the
public
interest
this
completely
bastardize
congress
process
and
instead
allow
the
cftc
to
make
arbitrary
and
capricious
decision
that
will
not
withstand
judicial
scrutiny
can
a
room
full
of
cftc
lawyer
seriously
say
that
not
one
of
they
have
open
predictit
to
check
biden
odd
since
the
debate
be
it
not
in
the
public
interest
for
people
to
know
who
their
next
leader
will
be
will
the
cftc
really
delegate
this
monumental
task
to
the
spin
room
pundit
who
be
not
incentivize
to
be
accurate
but
instead
be
incentivize
to
sell
interesting
story
if
I
have
listen
to
what
the
market
be
tell
I
a
year
ago
I
would
have
be
so
shocked
by
what
I
see
on
june
27
I
would
have
be
able
to
make
adjustment
to
my
future
plan
maybe
include
my
stock
portfolio
which
include
a
lot
of
green
energy
stock
that
will
crash
if
trump
win
in
november
prior
to
the
debate
the
information
be
there
even
if
I
be
ready
to
hear
it
market
be
important
the
cftc
know
that
this
be
the
first
time
that
I
think
I
be
smart
than
a
market
and
it
be
the
first
time
that
I
be
wrong
what
matter
be
that
I
have
a
way
to
know
that
my
preconceived
notion
be
wrong
the
source
of
unbiased
information
be
there
it
be
on
predictit
predictit
market
be
a
valuable
public
service
and
be
quite
clearly
in
the
public
interest
I
also
far
from
the
only
one
who
see
their
value
in
the
recent
turmoil
that
have
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
june
27
debate
the
new
york
times
the
wall
street
journal
bloomberg
and
the
financial
time
have
all
write
article
cite
predictit
market
as
a
valuable
source
of
unbiased
information
amongst
the
tumult
I
object
to
this
absurd
rulemaking
which
will
never
in
any
case
survive
a
judicial
challenge
without
chevron
this
be
a
waste
of
time
and
the
commission
should
pull
a
180
and
support
these
contract
