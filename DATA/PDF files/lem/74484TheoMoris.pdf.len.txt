I
be
write
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to

to
highlight
the
vital
benefit
that
such
contract
offer
as
well
as
to
critique
the
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definition
that
underpin
this
proposal
1

a

as
a
barometer
of
public
sentiment
and
expectation
regard
election

base

a
valuable

the

insight
into
how
different

of
the

be
likely
to

how
they
perceive

this

be
not
merely

risk

3
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definition
the
process
by
which
the
cftc
have
approach
this
proposal
raise
serious
concern
the
decision
to
ban
election
contract
appear
to
have
be
make
without
a
thorough
examination
of
the
empirical
evidence
regard
their
impact
on
market
and
their
utility
for
hedging
there
have
be
insufficient
engagement
with
stakeholder
who
rely
on
these
contract
for
legitimate
purpose
and
a
lack
of
comprehensive
datum
analysis
to
justify
such
a
sweeping
ban
moreover
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
be
excessively
broad
and
fail
to
distinguish
between
legitimate
market
activity
and
those
that
may
pose
actual
risk
the
characterization
of
election
contract
as
inherently
problematic
conflate
different
type
of
market
activity
and
overlook
the
positive
role
these
contract
play
in
provide
price
discovery
and
risk
management
the
cftc
proposal
seem
to
misinterpret
or
overextend
the
concept
of
gaming
to
include
all
form
of
speculation
in
election
market
this
overly
broad
definition
undermine
the
nuanced
understanding
require
to
regulate
these
market
effectively
it
fail
to
acknowledge
that
election
contract
when
properly
regulate
can
coexist
with
market
integrity
and
offer
significant
value
to
participant
