of

contract
yours
truly
peter
kempthorne
comment
on
select
public
question
post
concern
the
congressional
control
contract
1
do
these
contract
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
describe
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
be
similar
to
gaming
as
describe
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
comment
the
underlie
activity
of
the
contract
be
political
control
this
activity
be
not
one
of
the
exclude
activity
in
regulation
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
or
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
while
such
contract
involve
bet
on
an
event
outcome
the
outcome
of
such
bet
be
not
purely
random
as
in
casino
game
or
akin
to
sport
bet
for
which
the
public
interest
could
be
challenge
instead
the
congressional
control
contract
provide
a
way
for
the
public
to
communicate
and
share
their
expectation
about
congressional
control
such
contract
trading
would
have
no
direct
impact
on
the
outcome
but
indirectly
the
wisdom
of
crowd
would
serve
the
public
interest
by
help
to
anticipate
congressional
composition
and
prepare
for
the
impact
of
alternate
outcome
2
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
whether
take
a
position
on
election
or
congressional
control
be
define
as
game
under
state
or
federal
law
comment
while
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
might
allow
similar
offering
these
do
not
serve
the
public
interest
allow
congressional
control
contract
on
the
kashi
exchange
would
serve
the
public
interest
by
provide
a
completely
equitable
transparent
market
for
such
contract
moreover
provide
such
contract
on
a
central
exchange
where
the
public
can
know
and
research
the
trading
activity
would
support
increase
the
liquidity
of
such
contract
enable
the
public
with
contract
position
to
adjust
or
close
their
contract
position
efficiently
in
both
time
and
cost
such
public
interest
feature
be
not
available
at
casino
or
sport
book
6
do
the
contract
serve
a
hedging
function
be
the
economic
consequence
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
base
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
example
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedge
directly
by
the
contract
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrate
the
hedge
utility
of
the
contract
comment
these
contract
definitely
serve
a
hedging
function
for
individual
and
investor
their
employment
circumstance
and
opportunity
can
depend
significantly
on
the
political
side
with
congressional
control
provide
the
ability
to
hedge
alternate
outcome
could
have
significant
value
to
affected
individual
also
the
investment
prospect
of
stock
or
bond
in
company
can
depend
significantly
on
congressional
control
renewable
vs
fossil
fuel
energy
company
electronic
vehicle
and
battery
manufacturer
the
congressional
control
contract
would
provide
additional
investment
option
to
individual
which
could
diversify
and
lower
their
exposure
to
identifiable
financial
risk
7
be
there
unique
economic
risk
tie
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedge
via
derivative
product
on
equity
debt
interest
rate
tax
rate
asset
value
and
other
commodity
price
comment
the
traditional
derivative
product
focus
on
the
risk
of
exist
underlying
asset
of
the
derivative
the
impact
of
congressional
control
be
more
broad
base
with
a
congressional
control
contract
such
risk
would
be
directly
tradable
make
the
amorphous
impact
direct
and
tradable
8
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
in
review
the
contact
hedging
function
be
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
use
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrate
need
by
likely
hedger
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
use
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participant
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedge
use
comment
the
hedge
function
of
congressional
control
contract
can
only
be
determine
through
their
use
as
actively
trade
contract
the
proof
of
demonstrate
need
by
likely
hedger
would
likely
not
come
until
the
active
and
liquid
market
for
such
contract
be
available
to
the
general
public
while
premature
an
interesting
question
be
whether
the
position
limit
for
such
contract
could
be
raise
for
participant
self
designate
themselves
as
hedger
such
market
activity
would
be
feasible
when
trade
in
such
a
contract
reach
maturity
with
sufficient
liquidity
11
do
the
contract
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
price
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
comment
as
note
in
question
6
the
investment
potential
of
stock
and
bond
of
company
can
be
significantly
affect
by
the
outcome
of
the
congressional
control
contract
the
risk
of
which
political
party
be
in
congressional
control
could
have
an
important
impact
on
price
commercial
transaction
in
such
asset
or
of
related
commodity
in
addition
to
the
direct
payoff
of
such
contract
their
information
value
in
term
of
market
insight
sentiment
wisdom
would
contribute
to
pricing
and
trading
in
these
other
asset
12
be
the
propose
contract
contrary
to
the
public
interest
why
or
why
not
comment
the
congressional
control
contract
be
definitely
in
the
public
interest
they
provide
two
key
contribution
1
the
ability
to
trade
contract
on
event
outcome
for
individual
directly
affect
by
the
event
and
2
the
information
content
of
informed
active
trader
about
the
likelihood
of
the
contract
event
for
use
and
consumption
by
the
general
public
16
should
campaign
committee
political
action
committee
candidate
for
the
house
and
senate
and
other
entity
involve
in
political
fundraising
and
expenditure
or
likely
to
hold
non
public
information
or
subject
to
federal
election
commission
oversight
be
prohibit
from
participate
in
the
contract
would
such
a
prohibition
help
address
federal
campaign
law
or
manipulation
and
surveillance
concern
how
would
such
restriction
impact
the
commission
determination
of
whether
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
comment
these
possible
prohibition
could
be
important
in
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
market
in
such
contract
I
would
support
such
prohibition
as
support
the
public
interest
objective
of
the
commission
