that

at

the

do
not

when
an

do
it

just
because
the

happen

for

a

how
do

on

but
like
english
judge
before
we
we
have
long
turn
to
familiar
consideration
to
guide
our
assessment
of
the
weight
due
a
past

so
for
example
as
this
court
have
put
it
the
weight
due
a

may
depend
on
the
quality
of
its

its

its
workability

that
have

around

the
first
factor
recognize
that
the
primary
power
of
any
precedent
lie
in
its
power
to
persuade
and
poorly
reason
decision
may
not
provide
reliable
evidence
of
the

mean
the
second
factor
reflect
the
fact
that
a
precedent
be
more
likely
to
be
correct
and
worthy
of
respect
when
it
reflect
the
time
test

of

than
when
it
sit
unmoored

ibid
the
remain
factor
like
workability
and
reliance
do
not
often
supply
reason
enough
on
their
own
to
abide
a
flawed
decision
for
almost
any
past
decision
be
likely
to
benefit
some
group
eager
to
keep
thing
as
they
be
and
content
with
how
thing
work
see
I
d
at

but
these
factor
can
sometimes
serve
function
similar
to
the
other
by
point
to
clue
that
may
suggest
a
past
decision
be
right
in
way
not
immediately
obvious
to
the
individual
judge

sometimes

believe
that
regulatory
expert
would
be
in

well
position

to
do
so

or
perhaps
congress
be
unable
to
forge
a

on
either

of

decide
to
take
their
chance
with

sometimes
though
the
gap
or
ambiguity
be
what
might
be
think
of
as
predictable

they
may
be
the
result
of
sloppy

they

and
when

find

power

until
then

cut

that

be
common

respond

the

that

have
insist

so
the

proceed
from
the

place
as
the
original
doctrine
take
together
they
give
interpretive
primacy
to
the

when
but
only
when
it
be
act
as
congress
specify
in
the

of

reflect

of

branch
pauley
501
at

where
congress
have
speak
congress
have
speak
only
its

matter
and
court
alone
determine
when
that
have
happen
use
all
their
normal
interpretive
tool
they
decide
whether
congress
have
address
a
give
issue
but
when
court
have
decide
that
congress
have
not
do
so
a
choice
arise
absent
a
legislative
directive
either
the
administer
agency
or
a
court
must
take
the
lead
and
the
matter
be
more
fit
for
the
agency
the
decision
be
likely
to
involve
the
agency
subject

expertise
to
fall
within
its
sphere
of
regulatory
experience
and
to
involve

choice
include

so
a
court
without

expertise
or

and
without

to
make

call
appropriately
step
back
the

still
have
a

to

the

that

rather
do

score

not

or
of

often
construe

hopefully
well
and

first
step
take
full
advantage
of
that
talent
there
a

try
to
divine
what
congress
mean
even
in
the
most
complicated
or
abstruse
statutory
scheme
the
deference
come
in
only
if
the
court
can
not
do
so
if
the
court
must
admit
that
standard
legal
tool
will
not
avail
to
fill
a
statutory
silence
or
give
content
to
an
ambiguous
term
that
be
when
the
issue
look

should

choose
the

protective

or
the
one
more
favorable

the
idea
that

have
special

in

such

whereas

have
be
if
I
may
say
malarkey
answer
those

not
mainly
demand
the
interpretive
skill
court
possess
instead
it
demand
one
or
more
of

long
engagement
with
a
regulatory

choice
it
be
court
not
agency
that
have
no
special
even
legitimacy
when
those
be
the
thing
a
decision
call
for
second
the
majority
complain
that
an
ambiguity
or

do
not
necessarily
reflect
a
congressional
intent
that
an
agency
should
have
primary
interpretive
authority
ante
at

on
that
score
I
agree
with
the
premise
it
do
necessarily
do
so
chevron
be
build
on
a
presumption
the
decision
do
not
maintain
that
congress
in
every
case
want
the
agency
rather
than
a
court
to
fill
in
gap
the
decision
maintain
that
when
congress
do
not
expressly
pick
one
or
the
other
we
need
a
default
rule
and
the
good
default
rule
agency
or
the
one
we
think
congress
would
generally
want
as
to
why
congress
would
generally
want
the
agency
the
answer
lie
in
everything
say
above
about
congress
delegation
of
regulatory
power
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
special
competency
see
supra
at

the
majority
appear
to
think
it
be
a
showstoppe
rejoinder
to
note
that
many
statutory
gap
and
ambiguity
be
unintentional
ante
at
22
but
to
begin
many
be
not
the
ratio
between
the
two
be
uncertain
see
supra
at

and
to
end
why
should
that
matter
in
any
event
congress
may
not
have
deliberately
introduce
a
gap
or
ambiguity
into
the
statute
but
it
know
that
pretty
much
everything
it
draft
will
someday
be
find
to
contain
such
a
flaw
give
that
knowledge
chevron
ask
what
would
congress
want
the
presume
answer
be
again
the
same
for
the
same
reason
the
agency
and
as
with
any
default
rule
if
congress
decide
otherwise
all
it
need
do
be
say
in
that
respect
the
proof
really
be
in
the
pudding
congress
basically
never
say
otherwise
suggest
that
chevron
choose
the
presumption
align
with
legislative
intent
or
in
the
majority
word
reality
ante
at
22
over
the
last
four
decade
congress
have
authorize
or
reauthorize
hundred
of

the

those

demonstrate

he
state
that

he
also
state
that

reject

the

then
be
more
inconsistent
and
less

than
it
later
become
the
point
here
be
only
that
the
court
come
nowhere
close
to
accept
the

view
of
the

take
the
language
from
section
706
that
the

rely

see
sunstein
1656
the

view
of
section

likewise
get
no
support
from
how
judicial

operate
in

lead
up
to
the

that
prior

matter
as
the

unlike

compare

if

at

dissent
opinion
I
have
see
no
reason
to
change
my
mind
the
majority
do
no
well
in
its
main
justification
for
overrule
chevron
the
decision
be
unworkable
ante
at
30
the
majority
first
theory
on
that
score
be
that
there
be
no
single
answer
about
what
ambiguity
mean
some
judge
turn
out
to
see
more
of
it
than
other
do
lead
to
different
result
ante
at
30

but
even
if
so
the
legal
system
have
for
many
year
in
many
context
deal
perfectly
well
with
that
variation
take
contract
law
it
be
hornbook
stuff
that
when
but
only
when
a
contract
be
ambiguous
a
court
interpreting
it
can
consult
extrinsic
evidence
see
cnh
industrial
reese

133

and
when
all
interpretive

still
leave

contract
be
construe
against
the
drafter
see

so
I
guess
the
contract
rule
of
the
50
state
be
unworkable
now
or
look
close
to
home
to
doctrine
this
court
regularly
apply

a

and
the
canon

I
could
go
on
but
the
point
be
make
there
be
ambiguity
trigger
all
over
the
law
somehow
everyone
seem
to
get
by
kagan
dissent
and
chevron
be
an
especially
puzzling
decision
to
criticize
on
the
ground
of
generate
too
much
judicial
divergence
there
good
empirical
meaning
non
impressionistic
evidence
on
exactly
that
subject
and
it
show
that
as
compare

a
predictable
effect
of
overrule
chevron
would
be
to
ensure
a
far
great
role
for
judicial
policy
preference
in
statutory
interpretation
and
far
more
common
split
along

line
so
if
consistency

judge
be
the

lodestar
then
the
court
should
not
overrule

but
return
to
use
it
the

second

likewise
a

the

complain
have
some
exception
which
so
the
majority
say
be
difficult
and
to
apply

at

recall
that
court
be
not
suppose
to
defer
when
the
agency
construe
a
statute
1
have
not
be

with
administer
that
law
2
have
not
use

notice

as
I
explain
those

the

also
aptly
call

with

they
define

in
which
congress
be
unlikely
to
have
want
agency
view
to
govern
ante
at

see
supra
at

and
on
the
difficulty
scale
they
be
nothing
much
have
congress
put
the
agency
in
charge
of
administer
the
statute
in
99
of
100
case
everyone
will
agree
on
the
answer
with
scarcely
a
moment
thought
do
the
agency
use
notice

comment
or
an
adjudication
before
render
an
interpretation
once
again
I
could
stretch
my
mind
and
think
up
a
few
edge
case
but
for
the
most
part
the
answer
be
an
easy
yes
or
no
the
major

exception
be
I
acknowledge
different
there
many

congress
in

congress

thus
raise

about

will
be
far
more
disruptive
the

try
to
alleviate
concern
about
a
piece
of
that
problem
it
state
that
judicial

that
have
uphold

that

some

really
the

I

to

an

can

come
up
with

maybe
a

will
say
the

be
poor

maybe
the

will
discover
something
unworkable
in

all
a

the
well
choice
to

fill
the
gap
in

because
agency
be

in

and
because
they
be

with
a
claim
to

because

there
be

this

there
be
no

usually
invoke
for

to
eliminate

give

pervasiveness
the
decision
to
do
so
be
likely
to
produce
large
scale
disruption
all
that
back
today
decision
be
the
majority
belief
that
chevron
be
wrong
that
it
give
agency
too
much
power
and
court
not
enough
but
shift
view
about
the
worth
of
regulatory
actor
and
their
work
do
not
justify
overhaul
a
cornerstone
of
administrative
law
in
that
sense
too
today
majority
have
lose
sight
of
its
proper
role
and
it
be
impossible
to
pretend
that
today
decision
be
a
one
off
in
either
its
treatment
of
agency
or
its
treatment
of

as
to
