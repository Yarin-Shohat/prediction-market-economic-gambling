this

seek
to
highlight
certain

pitfall
in
the
proposal
that
could
frustrate
that
mission
it
be
fundamental
to
treat

as
a
concept
that

the
balance
it
seek
helpful
aspect
of
the
propose
rule
the
cftc
should
be
applaud
for
initiate
a
rulemaking
process
rather
than
engage
in
regulation
through
enforcement
a
pernicious
approach
that
deprive
market
participant
of
advance
warning
of
the
rule
of
engagement
in
the
marketplace
and
simultaneously
force
they
to
pay
for
the
lesson
through
ne
and
reputational
damage
another
unappealing
approach
to
the
matter
discuss
in
the

be
oere

time
limit
no

relief
be
a
tool
that
the
cftc
have
experience
pressure
to
use
in
the
past
such
as
when
the
pace
and
volume
of
rulemaking
have
make
the
dicultie
of
strategic
regulatory
implementation
hard
than
usual
although
sometimes
appropriate
such
an
approach
be
suboptimal
when
it
be
use
to
kick
the
can
of
regulatory
clarity
indenitely
down
the
road
for
market
participant
in
addition
to
the
prudence
of
make

through

process
the

provide
the

with
an
opportunity

and
provide

the

have
take
that
obligation
seriously
as

in

the

its
embrace
of

as
require
under

cea

as
discuss
below
one
should
consider
whether
the
adjective
responsible
overshadow
the
noun
innovation
responsible
innovation
the
propose
rule
appear
to
suppress
rather
than
promote
responsible
innovation
the

state
that

would
support

innovation
propose
rule
48972
while
it
be
arguable
that
the
limit
term
responsible
might
be
address
by
compliance
enhancement
it
take
more
than
a
stretch
of
imagination
to
understand
how
curb
behavior
appropriate
as
that
be

much
less
promote
it

again
make

otherwise
be
not
very
cut
edge
rather
it
be
at
good
the
sustenance
of
the
status

in
any
commercial
enterprise
furthermore
the
propose
rule
refer
to
the
support
of
responsible
innovation
the
statutory
obligation
be
to
promote
it
see
cea
7
code
give
that
the
congress
have
impose
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
cftc
to
promote
responsible
innovation
the
commission
need
to
demonstrate
action
that
move
innovation
forward
even
while
preserve
the
limitation
that
it
be
responsible
the
propose
rule
mention
a
commitment
to
responsible
innovation
several
time
but
merely
conclude
that
the
propose
rule
achieve
this
end
without
explain
how
it
be
meet
see
propose
rule
at
pp
48969

48973
the
propose
rule
do
not
offer
any
evidence
of
action
or
standard
of
review
that
would
promote
innovation
in
fact
even
the
unsupported
statement
that
the
rule
support
innovation
have
the
unfortunate
internal
conflict
of
point
away
from
innovation
and
toward
limitation
the
propose
rule
conflate
concept
muddy
the
logic
of
its
rationale
the
propose
rule
broad
definition
of
gaming
sweep
in
a
host
of
current
and
as
yet
unknown
product
include
those
that
simply
be
in
connection
with
the
cftc
propose
new
definition
of
gaming
and
none
of
which
have
be
determine
to
be
illegal
by
state
or
federal
legislature
moreover
the
propose
rule
have
stretch
the
commission
own
understanding
of
the
word
game
gambling
to
include
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
propose
rule
48988
of
course
the
word
contest
and
game
do
not
ordinarily
imply
gambling
without
more
being
say
by
its
logic
the
propose
rule
could
allow
the
cftc
to
ban
hedge
activity
by
airline
and
hotel
conglomerate
lead
to
the
olympic
boundary
of
the
executive
branch
the
commission
play
an
important
role
not
just
in
the
derivative
market
but
also
in
the
service
of
the
public
in
implement
legislation
adopt
by
the
congress
the
propose
rule
suggest
that
one
reason
for
paint
the
term
game
with
an
overly
broad
brush
be
to
save
cost
in
do
the
work
of
review
the
appropriateness
of
case
by
case
example
propose
rule
48988
save
money
be
not
an
excuse
for
step
into
the
purview
of
legislator
which
unlike
the
commission
be
elect
by
the
public
and
ban
certain
activity
that
be
legal
under
relevant
legislation
the
propose
rule
explicitly
mention
the
commission
recognition
of
the
absence
of
a
formal
statutory
definition
of
the
term
game
propose
rule
48988
as
if
that
support
a
conclusion
that
the
cftc
should
step
into
the
presume
breach
the
supreme
court
have
recently
address
the
proper
role
of

and

node
in
a

go
forward
it
will
become
more
important
to
do
precisely
what
the
propose
rule
seek
to
avoid
allow
the
market
to
work
with
the
cftc
to
continue
to
develop

innovate
resolve
interpretive

on
a
case
by

basis
through
the
registration
contract
market
application
examination
and
self

that
be
already
in
place
this
would
meet
the
objective
of
promote

with

that
such

the

in

the

the
cftc
have
already
permit
certain

that
have

without
cftc
objection
the
propose
rule
as
it
be
so
broadly
draft
would
be
tantamount
to
retroactively
penalize
those

despite
their
having
legally
build
business
to
be
in

with
cftc
parameter
this
comment
letter
note
above
the
constructiveness
of
the
propose
rulemaking
process
in
that
it
discipline
agency
temptation
to
regulate
through
enforcement
the
propose
rule
could
lead
to
a
result
similar
to
that
cause
by
regulation
through
enforcement
by
cast
doubt
upon
exist
business
the
impact
on
exist
self
certifier
be
not
the
end
of
the
potential
damage
the
core
of
the
self
certification
process
itself
could
become
corrupted
if
the
door
be
open
to
lawmaking
feat
by
the
agency
that
have
already
approve
contract
market
bring
product
to
the
marketplace
in
their
own
discretion
within
the
bound
of
cftc
issue
core
principle
and
rule
it
would
be
unfortunate
for
the
pricing
of
derivative
to
reflect
increase
or
erratic
regulatory
change
risk
that
exist
in
other
region
of
the
world
conclusion
and
suggest
step
the
commission
track
record
of
thorough
consideration
of
all
comment
receive
in
rulemake
process
be
well
know
thus
roo
ask
that
the
commission
regard
this
and
all
other
comment
as
an
earnest
attempt
to
support
the
commission
in
its
important
and
complex
role
in
our
market
in
that
spirit
below
be
specific
suggestion
1
the
commission
should
not
dene
gaming
on
behalf
of
the
legislature
if
the
cftc
choose
to
provide
insight
to
the
legislature
because
of
cftc
expertise
such
guidance
should
exclude
the
overly
broad
category
of
any
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
2
the
commission
should
review
the
impact
of
the
propose
rule
on
exist
self
certify
product
and
the
self
certification
process
to
ensure
that
rulemaking
do
not
penalize
legally
operate
organization
attempt
to
abide
by
longstanding
cftc
principle
3
the
commission
should
take
ample
deliberative
time
to
reflect
on
the
worthwhile
dialogue
and
attention
be
give
now
to
question
of
administrative
agency
authority
and
role
the
long
term
value
for
our
society
and
our
market
can
not
be
overstate
the
cftc
should
continue
to
act
with
respect
for
the
define
role
of
the
executive
branch
and
other
branch
of
government
even
as
interpretation
of
those
role
evolve
over
time
thank
you
again
for
consider
this
comment
letter
and
for
afford
all
of
we
the
opportunity
to
be
engage
in
the
regulatory
process
for
the
benefit
of
our
market
sincerely
