the
propose
contract
do
not
involve
gaming
politic
be
no
mere
sport
carry
out
for
the
entertainment
and
fleecing
of
bystander
to
the
enrichment
of
the
participant
in
a
legitimate
sport
both
the
victor
and
the
loser
get
pay
as
recognition
for
their
service
however
political
contest
only
benefit
the
candidate
whomstve
emerge
victorious
and
their
extended
family
2
the
commission
should
pay
no
heed
to
the
availability
of
similar
bet
in
traditional
gambling
venue
such
as
casino
yes
if
I
want
to
I
could
fly
to
vegas
and
gamble
away
my
life
saving
at
ease
but
this
be
not
a
sufficient
substitute
as
it
do
not
provide
the
instant
gratification
that
come
from
be
able
to
gamble
from
the
comfort
of
my
house
in
my
underwear
I
would
go
one
step
far
and
suggest
that
the
commission
explicitly
permit
kalshi
to
accept
instant
cryptocurrency
transfer
which
be
universally
acknowledge
as
the
goate
medium
of
exchange
for
degenerate
gambler
3
as
someone
who
commit
three
felony
a
day
in
other
word
an
american
citizen
I
would
presume
that
this
violate
regulation
too
numerous
to
count
however
as
a
legal
realist
I
must
too
recognize
that
the
odd
of
anyone
be
prosecute
for
gambling
on
an
election
website
be
approximately
null
except
if
donald
trump
be
to
purchase
851
worth
of
any
contract
4
I
would
certainly
hope
that
the
commission
do
not
engage
in
rule
make
under
the
influence
5
the
nadex
contract
in
question
be
old
than
the
dinosaur
and
self
evidently
obsolete
election
in
2022
be
substantially
different
than
those
in
2012
involve
a
different
populace
different
candidate
and
a
newly
gerrymander
map
along
with
extensive
hard
work
at
voter
suppression
additionally
the
apr
2nd
date
of
the
order
unceremoniously
banish
nadex
to
the
nether
region
suggest
the
possibility
of
the
whole
thing
be
an
elaborate
april
fool
prank
the
commission
should
ignore
the
decision
of
the
prior
commissioner
you
be
in
charge
now
act
like
it
6
I
expend
significant
resource
each
election
cycle
bribe
politician
across
the
country
the
propose
contract
be
essential
in
hedge
my
investment
without
the
ability
to
hedge
I
would
be
force
to
cut
such
activity
as
the
risk
of
loss
would
be
too
high
7
the
risk
of
my
preferred
political
party
be
in
power
can
not
be
hedge
via
exist
derivative
product
as
those
be
tie
to
specific
asset
that
may
not
necessarily
move
in
the
same
direction
as
the
asset
I
expect
my
politician
to
promote
8
if
henry
ford
have
ask
his
customer
what
they
want
they
would
have
say
a
fast
horse
the
lack
of
any
plausible
conceivable
or
metaphysically
possible
legitimate
hedging
use
for
a
market
should
not
deter
the
commission
from
expeditiously
approve
this
application
if
you
build
it
people
will
come
in
addition
require
evidence
from
user
of
their
hedging
use
violate
their
first
amendment
right
cf
citizen
unite
9
the
commission
should
not
consider
contract
size
in
determine
the
hedge
utility
of
the
product
there
be
at
least
two
side
to
every
market
if
my
legitimate
hedging
need
require
attract
large
amount
of
small
retail
user
on
the
other
side
that
should
be
encourage
I
would
far
suggest
encourage
the
use
of
at
least
100x
leverage
if
not
more
so
small
user
can
help
support
the
liquidity
need
of
whale
such
as
myself
10
our
entire
computational
economy
be
build
on
the
binary
system
anything
and
everything
can
be
reduce
into
binary
term
a
sufficient
number
of
binary
contract
can
be
utilize
to
hedge
any
event
include
nonbinary
one
11
the
contract
serve
a
legitimate
and
highly
desirable
pricing
function
for
example
a
store
could
sell
people
political
apparel
such
as
t
shirt
or
cap
on
credit
and
their
underwriter
can
price
the
default
risk
base
on
the
probability
of
the
relevant
political
party
be
in
power
12
to
paraphrase
james
burnham
the
public
may
not
be
interested
in
the
propose
contract
but
the
propose
contract
be
interested
in
the
public
if
there
be
uncertainty
about
how
much
public
interest
there
might
be
in
these
market
I
would
simply
suggest
add
additional
market
to
determine
that
13
I
be
go
to
write
a
detailed
response
to
this
question
but
I
get
distract
by
the
apparently
unironic
use
of
perception
of
the
integrity
of
election
in
14
as
discuss
in
my
response
to
3
this
likely
violate
many
such
law
regard
the
specific
concern
of
campaign
use
some
kind
of
morse
code
signal
via
election
market
pricing
to
bypass
restriction
on
coordination
between
cccs
and
pac
I
personally
and
respectfully
submit
this
be
improbable
15
this
concern
be
misplace
everyone
who
have
not
yet
vote
be
in
exclusive
possession
of
non
public
polling
datum
with
trading
on
private
information
be
not
and
have
never
be
improper
and
the
commission
be
well
place
to
enforce
prohibition
on
illegal
insider
trading
as
long
as
it
not
by
current
former
or
future
member
of
congress
16
I
object
to
the
implication
that
nancy
pelosi
can
freely
trade
whatever
stonk
she
want
but
when
a
new
innovative
market
want
to
offer
similar
hedging
instrument
to
member
of
congress
they
should
be
prevent
from
do
so
our
congresscritter
should
be
equally
allow
to
degenerately
gamble
away
their
life
saving
and
federal
pension
as
any
other
american
17
