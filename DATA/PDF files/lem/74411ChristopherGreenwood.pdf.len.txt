honorable
chairman

cftc
as
the
commission
and
staff
of
the
cftc
well
know
speculator
play
a
vital
role
in
capital
market
in
general
and
future
market
in
particular
both
market
assume
risk
that
be
an
integral
part
of
our
well
function
financial
system
which
continue
to
be
the
envy
of
the
world
in
future
market
commercial
entity
transfer
part
of
their
risk
to
the
speculator
who
in
turn
assume
that
risk
for
the
opportunity
to
earn
a
profit
a
major
misconception
that
still
prevail
among
the
public
be
the
equivalence
of
gambling
and
speculation
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
gambling
be
an
artificial
self
construct
risk
create
for
recreation
speculation
be
the
assumption
of
risk
that
already
exist
in
the
real
and
financial
market
the
recreational
risk
of
gambling
be
not
present
until
the
casino
or
racetrack
be
build
and
wager
be
accept
on
the
other
hand
risk
in
the
production
of
good
and
service
in
the
economy
be
real
and
will
exist
even
in
the
absence
of
future
market
the
same
can
be
say
for
equity
and
interest
rate
and
risk
it
seem
reasonable
to
conclude
the
risk
associate
with
policy
change
from
different
election
outcome
be
most
similar
to
the
latter
the
transfer
of
risk
by
hedger
would
be
real
and
the
assumption
of
that
risk
by
speculator
would
be
proper
this
distinction
build
on
work
do
by
both
as
academic
and
practitioner
almost
fifty
year
ago
the
chicago
board
of
trade
publish
a
booklet
for
speculator
entitle
speculate
in
future
a
copy
will
be
send
under
separate
cover
it
clearly
underline
the
difference
between
hedger
and
speculator
their
interaction
as
market
participant
and
the
speculator
key
role
to
help
facilitate
efficient
risk
transfer
as
we
enter
a
new
era
with
innovation
in
new
product
and
deconstruction
of
exist
one
those
of
we
who
care
deeply
about
our
future
market
hope
this
distinction
between
gambling
and
speculation
will
help
guide
future
decision
that
the
commission
may
encounter
as
always
long
time
market
participant
and
practitioner
stand
ready
to
be
an
unbiased
resource
