open
my
eye
to
the
utility
of

demonstrate
their
unique
ability
to
distill
information
and
gauge
market
sentiment
in
way

show
that

to
prediction
market
instead
of
rely
solely
on

gauge
the
likely
outcome

I
look
to

although
prediction
market
be
not
infallible
such
as
their
performance
during
the
2016
presidential
election
they
be
often
more
accurate
than
