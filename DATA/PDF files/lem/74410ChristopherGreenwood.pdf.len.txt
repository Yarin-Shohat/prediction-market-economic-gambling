re

on

llc
will
party
be
in
control
of

chamber
of
congress
contract
for
public
comment
honorable
chairman
and
commissioner
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
from
2017
to
2021
I
have
the
privilege
to
serve
as
a
commissioner
of
the
cftc
under
the
leadership
of
former
chair
christopher
giancarlo
and
heath
tarbert
and
then
act
chair
rostin
behnam
before
my
time
at
the
agency
I
run
my
own
investment
firm
work
for
a
bank
focus
hedge
fund
during
the
financial
crisis
and
serve
as
a
staffer
in
the
house
of
representative
since
leave
public
office
I
have
be
an
advisor
for
andreessen
horowitz
capital
management
and
sit
on
kalshi
board
of
director
I
remember
fondly
a
saying
at
the
agency
every
day
be
a
good
day
at
the
cftc
indeed
it
be
that
be
the
case
however
not
because
the
commission
avoid
make
hard
decision
or
take
the
easy
route
on
difficult
issue
in
fact
it
be
true
because
we
deal
with
those
thing
and
do
so
in
an
honest
transparent
and
accessible
manner
with
decision
and
statement
well
support
by
legal
analysis
datum
and
commenter
perspective
in
fact
during
my
time
as
a
commissioner
the
agency
deliberate
and
decide
upon
many
philosophically
challenge
controversial
and
statutorily
confusing
matter
in
the
execution
of
my
role
I
find
the
good
way
to
address
such
issue
be
adhere
to
a
strong
regulatory
philosophy
combine
with
a
very
deliberate
reading
of
the
statute
and
weigh
the
appropriateness
of
any
exist
or
propose
regulation
to
the
issue
risk
and
opportunity
I
commend
the
current
chair
and
commissioner
for
take
a
similar
posture
towards
their
duty
I
also
believe
as
have
be
express
through
our
constitution
and
through
the
precedent
of
multiple
supreme
court
decision
that
the
government
have
limit
authority
and
independent
agency
can
not
assume
broad
authority
than
the
statute
pass
by
congress
and
sign
into
law
by
the
president
convey
to
they
such
an
outcome
would
put
into
question
the
check
and
balance
of
the
separation
of
power
as
well
as
the
ability
of
the
population
to
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
government
decision
speak
of
power
independent
agency
have
a
significant
amount
of
it
commissioner
serve
for
staggered
term
agency
regulation
be
heavily
insulate
from
congressional
review
and
the
chair
be
difficult
to
remove
if
not
debatably
irremovable
from
office
as
such
a
deliberate
and
concert
focus
on
what
discrete
authority
the
law
convey
and
whether
the
agency
be
act
in
accordance
with
those
power
in
a
manner
that
be
justify
consistent
and
repeatable
be
what
the
american
public
and
our
derivative
market
deserve
throughout
my
time
at
the
commission
and
consistently
through
its
distinguished
history
the
cftc
have
be
at
the
forefront
of
market
lead
innovation
see
for
instance
christopher
giancarlo
letter
to
the
senate
committee
on
agriculture
nutrition
and
forestry

available

it
be
precisely
because
of
this
history
the
united
states
enjoy
the
deep
most
liquid
and
broad
derivative

in
the
world
along
those
line
during
my
time
as

the

5
the
special
rule
include
three
important
step
for
a
contract
to
be
relevant
first
the
contract
in
question
must
be
base
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
in
other
word
an
event
contract
second
the
contract
event
must
involve
at
least
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
then
if
the
commission
find
that
the
contract
do
involve
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
it
may
determine
the
contract
as
a
whole
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nadex
conclude
that
participate
in
the
political
event
contract
in
question
be
equivalent
to
wager
or
bet
and
thus
game
to
trigger
the
special
rule
beyond
its
blatantly
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
this
be
a
shockingly
poor
and
vague
classification
of
activity
that
would
scope
in
common
and
vital
participation
in
the
future
market
how
should
the
line
between
morally
dubious
gaming
activity
and
important
and
valuable
speculative
activity
be
draw
gaming
describe
wager
money
on
an
occurrence
that
have
no
inherent
economic
value
itself
other
than
the
money
wager
on
its
outcome
for
instance
wager
money
on
roulette
or
blackjack
should
be
consider
gaming
because
there
be
no
economic
significance
of
the
activity
apart
from
the
wager
itself
speculation
on
the
contrary
be
risk
value
where
the
underlie
activity
have
economic
consequence
which
then
mean
the
speculative
activity
create
valuable
societal
and
economic
benefit
from
a
price
discovery
and
risk
transfer
function
for
those
expose
to
the
risk
of
that
underlie
activity
unbelievably
the
commission
never
concretely
define
or
even
philosophically
state
the
difference
between
gaming
as
represent
in
and
the
speculation
that
exist
every
day
in
derivative
marketplace
and
be
a
critical
component
of
their
purpose
but
yet
it
have
choose
to
and
may
choose
to
again
here
apply
a
term
it
have
define
to
an
activity
that
be
actually
more
similar
to
traditional
and
valuable
speculative
market
participation

esteemed

the
commission
would
owe
they
a
strong
explanation
if
its
conclusion
on
this
point
have
not
change
there
be
plenty
of
event
that
have
a
discernable
and
legitimate
economic
impact
and
whose
probabilistic
outcome
can
be
estimate
through
an
analysis
of

they
be
not

nor
be
they
game
of

that
be
just
as
true
for
election
outcome
as
it
be
for
the
price
production
and

of

like

gold
hedge

put

to

the

they

figure
some

those

then
also
provide

if
the

be

enough
in

they
will
move
the
equilibrium
price
and
provide

signal
to

as

and
express
those
view
through
exist
future

as
a
case
in
point
the
demand
for
such
predictive
election
information
have
explode
in
recent
year
and
have
be
the
basis
of
entire
publication
like
fivethirtyeight
or
the
new

times
needle
from
a
statutory
perspective
the
relevant
portion
of
the
cea
prohibit
register
board

from
list

whose
underlie

reference
one
of

the
cea
do
not
give
the
commission
authority
to
conclude
that
participate
in
the
contract
could
constitute
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
the
statute
be
very
clear
on
this
matter
I
the
statute
limit
the
scope
of
the
commission
authority
to
activity
and
activity
only
the
commission
only
have
discretion
to
take

on

involve

the

at
if
the
commission
determine
that
such
product
may
involve
an

that
be
enumerate
in
these
activity
be
not
the
contract
themselves
they
be
the
event
that
create
the
basis
for
the
relevant
contract
ii
if
congress
assume
as
the
commission
imply
through
nadex
that
the
act
of
participate
in
a
event
contract
could
itself
constitute
gaming
there
would
have
be
no
need
for
congress
to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contract
upon
which
the
commission
could
make
a
public
interest
determination
since
they
would
already
fall
under
the
unlawful
activity
prong
iii
if
state
gambling
definition
of
wager
and

be
analogous
to
the
act
of
take
a
position
in
the
political
event
contract
as
nadex
argue
nadex
at
2
3
then
those
same
state
definition
would
be
analogous
to
take
a
position
on
any
event
contract
include
one
whose
underlie
activity
be
an
economic
indicator
or
the
weather
the
commission
can
not
hold
that
participate
in
these
propose
contract
involve
gaming
without
also
implicate
participation
in
all
other
event
contract
such
an
outcome
would
also
clearly
be
in
tension
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
be
to
carve
out
a
select
few
event
contract
with
an
underlie
activity
that
be
specifically
reference
or
subsequently
identify
by
the
commission
through
a
rulemaking
iv
this
interpretation
would
require
the
commission
to
interpret
involve
differently
across
the
enumerate
activity
since
participate
in
any
event
contract
itself
clearly
can
not
ever
constitute
an
act
of
assassination
war
or
terrorism
be
on
exclude
commodity
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction
and
be
vet
through
the
v
the
statute
actually
prevent
event
with
no
financial
impact
to
be
consider
as
exclude
commodity
in
order
for
the
special
rule
in
to
apply
to
kalshi
contract
those
contract
already
have
to
be
on
event
that
be
consider
exclude
commodity
the
statutory
definition
of
an
exclude
commodity
include
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
that
be
1
beyond
the
control
of
the
relevant
party
to
the
contract
and
2
associate
with
a
financial
commercial
or
economic
consequence
7
because
kalshi
contract
special
rule
then
by
the
very
definition
of
an
exclude
commodity
in
the
statute
the
event
contain
an
economic
risk
that
can
be
hedge
if
the
event
do
not
then
that
event
would
constitute
gaming
not
an
exclude
commodity
and
not
subject
to
the
commission
purview
question
other
venue
offering
in
the
second
question
pose
to
the
public
for
comment
the
commission
ask
whether
it
should
consider
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
whether
take
a
position
on
election
or
congressional
control
be
define
as
game
under
state
or
federal
law
when
make
its
gaming
determination
it
be
difficult
to
understand
the
rationale
for
include
this
question
but
that
sentiment
be
not
unique
to
this
question
either
as
this
be
one
of
several
example
of
arbitrary
standard
propose
through
the
commission
question
to
the
public
strikingly
this
specific
question
be
not
ask
of
the
public
when
it
be
consider
the
legality
of
erisx
propose
nfl
future
contract
which
be
a
staple
of
such
venue
question
on

for
public
comment
available
at
additionally
this
standard
be
not
find
in
law
or
in
commission
history
and
precedent
moreover
partisan
control
of
congress
be
not
a
bet
available
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
that
it
be
sometimes
available
on
illegal
one
can
not
be
hold
against
kalshi
proposal
take
a
possible
motive
of
this
question
to
its
potentially
backward
conclusion
it
would
be
challenge
regulatory
logic
to
allow
bucket

to

in

question
three
and
four
as
discuss
at
length
above
the
statute
refer
to
the
underlie

of

not
the

itself
the

only
involve
obviously
legal
activity
the
partisan
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the

and
president
pro

however
even
if
the
commission
do
consider
the
contract
as
a
whole
instead
of
just
the
contract
underlie
event
against
state
law
the
contract
nonetheless
do
not
involve
illegal
activity
because
of
preemption
a
contract
offer
by
a
register
board
of
trade
otherwise
compliant
with
the
law
and
regulation
could
never
constitute
unlawful
state

there
be
no
scenario
where
a
kalshi

would
be
illegally
trade
the

on

from
a
state

perspective
in
addition
the

have
a
carveout
specifically
for

product
like
kalshi

as
do
many

similarly
the

speculate
that

this

be
exactly
what
kalshi

allow

to

in
question
eleven
the

make
the

mistake
when
it
ask

the

could
form
the

from

also
exclude

such
as

it
be
in
the

to
list
an

two

that

would
have

congress
at

elicit
that
probability
through

event
contract
directly
on

would

the

discard
this

the

through

for

the

a
