one
might
argue
that
with
the
advance
in
technology
game
do
have
to
be
play
in
a
confine
space
anymore
it
be
true
that
advance
in
technology
allow
two
people
to
play
a
game
say
chess
even
when
they
be
not
within
a
confine
space
however
the
technology
simply
add
another
mode
of
play
by
allow
player
to
play
even
if
they
be
not
in
the
same
physical
space
the
game
still
do
not
spread
beyond
the
playing
field
it
be
just
that
the
technology
allow
the
play
field
to
be
virtual
sometimes
critically
however
if
the
player
wish
to
bypass
technology
and
play
the
game
the
old
fashioned
way
they
still
could
that
be
if
two
sibling
in
the
same
house
want
to
play
chess
they
could
go
to
different
room
and
play
online
or
they
could
get
the
chessboard
out
and
play
the
difference
between
a
game
and
contest
seem
structural
more
than
anything
else
a
contest
be
often
between
individual
that
will
be
rank
accord
to
some
measure
whereas
a
game
can
also
be
play
between
team
far
a
contest
be
generally
consider
to
be
a
one
shot
event
whereas
a
game
can
be
play
repeatedly
like
roulette
in
any
event
nfi
do
believe
the
precise
distinction
between
a
game
and
contest
be
critical
for
the
question
pose
in
the
propose
rulemaking
because
dodd
frank
be
intend
to
cover
all
contract
that
be
base
on
future
contingent
event
what
be
critical
be
that
I
game
contest
happen
in
a
confine
space
and
ii
participant
have
control
over
the
game
they
play
or
the
contest
they
compete
in
they
can
choose
not
to
play
or
compete
and
even
after
they
do
they
stop
play
or
compete
they
can
leave
the
field
drop
out

what
be
a
claim
aswath

at

of

define
a
contingent
claim
as
follow
a
contingent
claim
or

be
an
asset
that

off

in
a
narrow
sense
whenever
a
payoff
be
tie
explicitly
to
an
event
or
a
set
of
event
the
arrangement
can
be
characterize
as
a
claim
example
include
binary
option
insurance
and
sport
bet
clearly
event
contract
be
claim
under
even
this
narrow
definition
more
broadly
any
contract
where
the
payoff
be
dependent
on
future
event
whether
or
not
they
be
explicitly
define
can
be
consider
as
a
claim
for
example
one
can
characterize
stock
as
a
claim
on
residual
cash
flow
of
the
business
however
for
the
purpose
of
this
rulemake
how
broad
the
definition
of
a
claim
be
not
relevant

when
do
a
game
or
contest
become
gambling
generally
speak
when
it
come
to
game
contest
gambling
occur
when
prize
chance
and
consideration
be
present
assume
prize
and
consideration
be
present
the
analysis
often
turn
on
whether
the
game
be
a
game
of
chance
or
game
of
skill
it
make
intuitive
sense
that
a
sound
policy
would
encourage
skill
base
game
and
contest
but
distinguish
they
from
chance
game
that
do
not
contribute
much
to
society
other
than
entertain
the
player
this
policy
effectively
require
two
thing
I
every
game
contest
be
place
somewhere
along
the
skill
chance
spectrum
and
ii
the
governing
authority
define
a
boundary
between
skill
and
chance
generally
qualitative
so
game
that
be
characterize
to
involve
less
than
the
skill
level
map
to
the
boundary
be
characterize
as
gamble
for
example
if
a
skill
game
be
define
as
one
where
skill
should
be
more
predominant
than
chance
it
become
rather
straightforward
to
conclude
that
chess
be
a
skill
game
and
roulette
be
not
4
when
do
a
contingent
claim
become
gamble
the
relevant
question
be
which
contingent
claim
do
we
want
to
allow
to
be
trade
as
a
society
and
how
will
we
measure
they
similar
to
game
contingent
claim
can
be
use
purely
for
entertainment
purpose
or
they
can
serve
the
public
interest
to
the
extent
the
trading
of
those
claim
result
in
publicly
useful
pricing
information
provide
risk
management
opportunitie
the
history
of
insurance
be
illuminate
in
this
respect
as
it
have
root
in
gambling
as
posner
and
weyl
observe
in
eighteenth
century
england
people
would
buy
life
insurance
on
politician
and
other
celebrity
so
that
if
the
name
person
die
the
purchaser
of
the
insurance
would
receive
a
payout
british
government
enact
a
statute
that
introduce
the
insurable
interest
rule
to
insurance
market
the
main
purpose
of
the
insurable
interest
rule
be
to
prevent
people
from
use
insurance
contract
to
gamble
see
eric
posner
and
glen
weyl
an
fda
for
financial
innovation
apply
the
insurable
interest
doctrine
to
twenty
first

the
late
cftc
commissioner
bart
chilton
would
make
a
somewhat
similar
observation
some
two
hundred
year
later
in
his
dissent
from

of

and

in
interpret
the
cea
we
be
to
exercise
some
modicum
of
common
sense
in
determine
whether
or
not
there
be
a
public
interest
in
deem
some
thing
a
commodity
for
purpose
of
federal
on
exchange
derivative
regulation
otherwise
the
statute
be
meaningless
unless
some
sensible
judgment
be
exercise
we
could
approve
terrorism
contract
or
contract
on
whether
a
certain
movie
star
will
die
or
become
disabled
or
contract
on
the
likelihood
of
ufos
hit
the
white
house
each
of
these
event
could
have
economic
consequence
but
it
be
hardly
appropriate
under
the
act
to
deem
they
commodity
to
say
that
simply
because
one
can
develop
a
future
contract
the
underlie
be
a
commodity
be
circular
reasoning
at
well
use
this
analysis
anything
under
the
sun
could
be
a
commodity
if
you
could
at
some
time
in
the
future
have
a
future
contract
on
it
we
know
that
be
not
how
congress
intend
for
we
to
interpret
the
act
available
at
access
on
august

2024
commissioner
chilton
be
misread
the
statute
that
the
trading
of
these
contract
be
not
desirable
do
not
mean
that
the
underlying
be
not
an
exclude
commodity
it
simply
mean
that
these
contract
be
not
deem
to
provide
sufficient
public
benefit
recognize
that
insurance
product
once
properly
design
serve
a
bona
fide
economic
purpose
the
state
of
new
york
would
exempt
insurance
from
the
statutory
prohibition
on
gambling
in
1889
appellant
brief
in
white
cuomo
limit
the
contract
to
certain
participant
may
have
work
for
insurance
because
a
multitude
of
speculate
counterpartie
continuously
trade
the
contract
be
not
need
for
the
main
benefit
to
accrue
to
the
participant
pay
out
the
claim
if
the
unwanted
event
materialize
a
car
accident
more
specifically
one
speculating
counterparty
the
insurance
company
and
one
contract
with
that
counterparty
be
sufficient
event
contract
do
not
have
that
luxury
for
price
discovery
risk
management
to
happen
trade
need
to
be
continuous
and
speculator
be
need
for
liquidity
thus
contract
on
contingent
claim
need
go
through
a
similar
analysis
as
game
I
every
contract
need
to
be
place
somewhere
along
the
entertainment
purpose
spectrum
and
ii
the
governing
authority
need
to
define
a
boundary
between
purpose
and
entertainment
which
may
be
qualitative
so
claim
that
be
characterize
to
involve
less
than
the
requisite
purpose
map
to
the
boundary
be
characterize
as
gamble
that
framework
already
exist
in
the
now
repeal
economic
purpose
test
the
only
sensible
interpretation
one
that
be
fully
support
by
legislative
history
as
well
as
the
commission
previous
position
be
that
notwithstanding
the
repeal
it
still
exist
today
why
that
must
be
the
case
be
discuss
far
below
in
section
5
what
be
the
definition
of
gamble
the
threshold
question
be
be
the
activity
a
game
or
a
claim
once
that
determination
be
make
the
gambling
evaluation
follow
use
the
framework
explain
above
a
simple
five
word
definition
of
gambling
be
as
follow
chance
game
and
entertainment
claim
this
simple
definition
produce
four
possible
outcome
skill
game
not
gamble
chance
game
gambling
purpose
claim
not
gamble
and
entertainment
claim
gambling
thus
there
be
gaming
that
be
not
gamble
skill
game
and
there
be
gamble
not
game
entertainment
claim

who
have
regulatory
authority
over
game
generally
state
regulate
gaming
under
their
police
power
they
decide
on
I
how
much
skill
be
need
for
a
game
to
be
characterize
as
a
skill
game
and
ii
to
the
extent
a
game
be
characterize
as
a
chance
game
whether
that
game
will
be
offer
to
its
citizen
for
money
and
if
so
under
what
condition
venue
limit
etc
thus
casino
game
that
be
chance
base
for
example
can
still
be
offer
to
the
citizen
but
would
be
explicitly
characterize
as
gamble
there
be
an
intuitive
reason
as
to
why
this
power
be
reserve
to
the
state
gaming
be
limited
to
a
physical
space
at
a
casino
for
example
the
gambling
activity
happen
on
the
casino
floor
if
a
fight
break
out
only
the
people
on
the
casino
floor
be
impact
that
locality
be
consistent
with
the
use
of
police
power
only
people
that
be
within
that
state
border
be
involve
with
that
gambling
activity
so
it
be
natural
for
the
state
local
police
or
tribal
law
enforcement
to
have
jurisdiction
7
who
have
regulatory
authority
over
claim
congress
establish
the
cftc
in
1974
and
task
it
with
oversee
commodity
supply
it
with
preemptive
federal
power
the
legislative
history
of
the
cftc
act
of
1974
also
make
it
clear
that
congress
intend
to
preempt
state
jurisdiction
over
the
transaction
that
the
act
cover
purcell

thus
the
cftc
do
have
preemptive
jurisdiction
over
all
contingent
claim
unless
another
federal
regulator
have
jurisdiction
like
the
sec
in
large
part
the
commission
have
be
grant
that
authority
because
state
be
encroach
into
the
federal
territory
opine
on
for
example
whether
or
not
derivative
contract
constitute
gambling
see
conaway
holding
that
thus
this
court
find
that
the
alabama
gambling
statute
if
construe
to
require
actual
delivery
would
directly
conflict
with
the
federal
purpose
of
foster
the

in
that
they
would
destroy
the

in

the
critical
distinction
between
a

and
a

that
the
former
be

the
latter

this

the

also
empower
the

to
prevent

I
do

such
as
a

attack

pose
a
real
commercial
risk
to
many
business
in

a

that
allow

that

would
also
involve

I

they
should
not
buy

a
future
market
be
for

it
be
not
an
insurance
market
the
first
enumerate
item
be
a
catch
all
with
the
idea
be
anything
unlawful
in
at
least
one
state
for
example
if
child
labor
be
unlawful
for
child
under
the
age
of
sixteen
a
contract
that
pay
out
whether
a
certain
business
would
employ
child
labor
would
incentivize
that
business
to
actually
employ
child
labor
or
a
child
who
might
find
it
financially
beneficial
to
fake
their
real
age
it
make
intuitive
sense
that
the
financial
market
should
not
be
provide
such
perverse
incentive
to
market
participant
the
second
third
and
fourth
enumerate
item
be
just
specific
example
by
enumerate

congress
signal
that
there
should
be
heighten
interest
for
these
category
to
be
clear
congress
do
not
prohibit
contract
involve
these
item
hence
nfi
use
of
the
term
near
prohibition
on
that
note
there
might
be
a
reasonable
policy
position
that
all
such
contract
could
be
deem
prohibit
in
its
propose
rulemake
the
commission
request
comment
on
whether
there
be
contract
that
may
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
that
do
not
raise
the
above
describe
public
interest
concern
one
example
could
be
a
contract
on
whether
a
particular
terrorist
would
be
capture
before
a
certain
date
the
contract
presumably
involve
terrorism
and
if
it
be
prohibit
directly
it
would
not
provide
an
additional
incentive
to
someone
in
the
organization
to
turn
in
a
terrorist
to
the
law
enforcement
that
say
there
may
be
other
incentive
to
encourage
this
type
of
activity
outside
of

event
contract
market
reward
for
justice
and
a
broad
ban
relate
to
these
category
may
not
necessarily
result
in
a
significant
public

the

to
the
extent
a

do
not
involve
an

any
of

not
pose

elevated

they
can
still

in

about

thus

anything

not
have

that
be
that
serious
but
they
may
still
be
contrary
to
public
interest
legislative
history
be
entirely
consistent
with
this
dichotomy
senator
lincoln
note
the
exchange
chairman
dodd
and
I
maintain
this
provision
in
the
conference
report
to
assure
that
the
commission
have
the
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
future
and
swap
market
that
would
allow
citizen
to
profit
from
devastating
event
and
also
prevent
gambling
through
future
market
emphasis
add
the
key
insight
here
be
that
congress
do
not
request
that
the
commission
review
every
single
contract
in
painstaking
detail
industry
participant
can
still
self
certify
after
all
kalshi
statement
if
you
sort
of
adopt
and
import
the
broad
definition
of
gambling
and
treat
any
contract
that
involve
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
or
on
an
uncertain
outcome
then
you
cover
the
waterfront
of
event
contract
be
disingenuous
see
transcipt
17
if
what
be
self
certify
be
a
rather
standard
event
contract
where
the
public
benefit
be
obvious
the
commission
can
simply
choose
not
to
disturb
that
contract
at
the
same
time
usurp
the
authority
to
review
any
contract
from
the
commission
that
do
not
involve
enumerate
item
which
be
precisely
what
kalshi
be
suggest
be
equally
pointless
under
that
interpretation
the
cftc
with
respect
to
event
contract
at
least
serve
no
real
filtering
function
it
just
become
a
rubber
stamp
regulator
that
would
be
force
to
regulate
whatever
ingenious
product
people
come
up
with
regardless
of
whether
they
serve
a
public
interest
or
not
that
can
be
the
law
certainly
not
one
that
be
intend
to
to
protect
consumer
from
abusive
financial
service
practice
the
optimal
level
of
regulation
instead
be
somewhere
in
between
the
objective
be
to
arm
the
commission
with
the
discretion
to
review
contract
that
can
potentially
cross
the
line
toward
gambling
if
deem
so
those
contract
would
not
serve
the
public
interest
a
few
remark
be
in
order
congress
mean
gambling
not
game
for
starter
in
the
legislative
exchange
regard
event
contract
the
word
gambling
be
use
more
three
time
than
game
two
time
the
exchange
far
neither
kalshi
nor
the
cftc
position
that
congress
mean
gaming
not
gambling
be
supportable
kalshi
adopt
a
very
restrictive
approach
and
argue
that
gaming
mean
game
casino
game
and
perhaps
also
sport
game
however
as
the
cftc
rightfully
point
out
it
never
explain
why
congress
simply
do
not
say
chance
game
or
sport
game
or
even
game
and
rather
say
game
with
the
in
the
end
enumerate
activity
be
all
noun
v
be
a
gerund
a
verb
form
that
function
as
a
noun
that
grammatical
break
be
not
a
coincidence
it
actually
signal
congress
intent
that
the
cea
section
analysis
itself
move
one
stage
to
a
different
stage
from
near
prohibition
to
discretion
contract
in
this
group
be
not
at
an
elevated
risk
of
provide
perverse
incentive
that
would
allow
citizen
to
profit
from
devastating
event
but
they
can
still
enable
gamble
the
cftc
on
the
other
hand
extend
the
definition
of
gaming
just
enough
so
it
conveniently
include
election
and
since
election
be
not
game
the
cftc
be
effectively
force
to
bring
contest
into
the
definition
as
well
as
commissioner
mersinger
correctly
point
out
this
mental
gymnastic
produce
weird
outcome
such
as
taylor
swift
attend
a
kansas
city
chiefs
game
be
gambling
commissioner
mersinger
use
the
word
game
not
gamble
it
rephrase
here
consistent
with
nfi
reading
of
the
statute
and
legislative
goal
but
taylor
swift
attend
a
beyonce
concert
be
not
what
make
the
commission
position
even
less
plausible
be
that
taylor
swift
attend
a
kansas
city
chiefs
game
be
arguably
relate
to
more
material
economic
activity
that
may
make
industry
participant
want
to
hedge
certain
risk
than
taylor
swift
attend
any
concert
see
for
example
news
of
the
week
taylor
swift
have
generate
330
million
for
the
nfl
available
at
access
on
august
8
2024
this
simply
can
not
be
what
congress
have
in
mind
on
a
similar
note
kalshi
and
cftc
apparently
both
agree
that
a
game
be
not
relate
to
significant
economic
activity
a
position
that
be
not
align
to
economic
reality
that
statement
could
be
true
for
a
random
poker
game
at
a
casino
but
the
nfl
alone
be
a
20
billion
dollar
business
as
such
contract
that
involve
sport
event
to
the
extent
that
do
not
constitute
gambling
could
serve
public
interest
in
sum
kalshi
narrow
the
definition
of
gambling
so
it
can
argue
for
eschew
a
robust
regulatory
review
and
the
cftc
extend
it
just
enough
so
it
can
assert
jurisdiction
over
election
contract
both
view
seem
to
be
opportunistic
that
be
intend
to
serve
the
party
own
agenda
rather
than
actually
protect
the
public
nor
do
they
pass
the
logic
test
the
most
natural
interpretation
one
that
be
consistent
with
legislative
history
be
that
gambling
under
the
cea
can
involve
a
contract
with
any
underlying
event
include
election
weather
sport
game
and
practically
everything
else
none
of
these
contract
be
gamble
automatically
but
they
can
just
reach
the
market
without
a
review
with
the
commission
have
the
authority
to
determine
how
much
review
be
need
this
beg
the
question
how
do
one
determine
which
claim
be
gamble
and
which
one
be
not
assessment
criterion
measurement
evaluation
and
assessment
be
a
fact
of
life
one
tangential
example
be
mention
early
in
this
comment
letter
assume
prize
and
consideration
be
present
the
analysis
as
to
whether
a
particular
game
constitute
gambling
often
turn
on
whether
the
game
be
a
game
of
chance
or
game
of
skill
that
scala
naturally
require
certain
judgment
call
decision
become
hard
especially
around
the
boundary
where
both
skill
and
chance
be
present
such
as
the
game
of
poker
another
broad
base
example
be
education
a
teacher
have
to
decide
which
student
will
pass
the
class
and
which
student
will
fail
an
exam
with
a
score
of
100
be
obviously
a
pass
and
an
empty
answer
sheet
be
clearly
a
fail
between
those
two
extreme
there
be
a
wide
variety
of
outcome
just
like
gaming
decision
become
hard
especially
around
the
middle
people
can
agree
to
disagree
whether
a
particular
game
be
a
game
of
skill
or
game
of
chance
or
whether
a
particular
student
deserve
a
pass
grade
or
not
for
borderline
game
or
student
performance
especially
two
reasonable
people
can
come
out
on
either
side
of
the
scale
that
say
nobody
have
ever
seriously
question
that
some
assessment
criterion
be
need
to
make
a
choice
which
by
its
nature
have
to
be
binary
a
contract
be
either
gambling
or
it
be
not
the
inherent
tension
underlie
all
of
these
case
be
that
a
continuous
scale
must
be
utilize
to
make
a
binary
choice
and
whatever
be
be
evaluate
game
exam
or
contract
that
tend
to
cluster
around
what
must
be
a
rather
subjective
boundary
be
ripe
for
disagreement
as
anyone
who
have
ever
attend
a
performance
review
at
work
can
attest
the
star
employee
and
the
complete
failure
be
easy
consensus
decision
the
majority
of
the
review
and
discussion
time
be
spend
on
borderline
case
arguably
election
market
contract
fit
squarely
into
this
category
admittedly
the
commission
find
itself
in
a
very
difficult
position
because
the
economic
purpose
test
be
repeal
deprive
it
of
its
main
assessment
tool
as
the
senator
note
the
commodity
future
modernization
act
of
2000
strip
the
cftc
of
this
authority
at
the
urging
of
industry
the
exchange
congress
take
away
the
only
sensible
scale
the
commission
have
if
state

declare
that
skill
chance
can
not
be
consider
anymore
in
whether
or
not

a
certain
game

regulator
would
be
helpless
similarly
if
congress
make
it
illegal
to
use
a
pass
fail
grading
system
teacher
all
around
the
country
would
throw
their
hand
in
the
air
or
create
picket
line
what
be
the
commission
actually
suppose
to
do
when
it
have
the
mandate
from
congress
to
to
protect
consumer
from
abusive
financial
service
practice
but
be
not
give
a
tool
for
decision
make
if
congress
really
intend
to
momentarily
take
that
authority
away
from
the
commission
it
have
backfire
and
arguably
contribute
to
the
great
recession
in
response
congress
restore
the
authority
back
to
the
commission
and
do
so
pretty
quickly
by
legislative
standard
within
a
decade
it
be
inconceivable
to
think
that
congress
when
the
country
be
still

all
kalshi

suggest
that
some

provision
elsewhere
in

could
come
to
the
rescue
that
alone
be
a
strong
signal
that
kalshi

that
turn
the

into

do
not

the
interpretation
advance
in
this
brief
by
nfi
be
much
more
sensible
under
that
interpretation
this
final
step
not
only
make
room
for
other
contract
but
also
act
as
a
final
catch
all
that
can
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
contract
that
serve
public

as
a
package
from
those
that
do
with
this
provision
the
commission
have
a
tool
right
in
the
middle
of
the
statute
and
not
in
some
unknown
corner
to
differentiate
contract
that
come
with
different
safeguard
even
if
they
be
wrap
around
what
be
otherwise
an
identical
contract
design
notwithstanding
the
traditional
view
that
commodity
market
have
inside
information
there
be
a
fundamental
fairness
issue
it
be
an
open
question
whether
as
the
contract
on
exclude
commodity
insider
trading
become
more
of
a
concern
similar
to
stock
market
intuitively
this
make
sense
a
farmer
certainly
know
more
about
the
status
of
his
orange
harvest
that
year
than
a
trader
sit
at
a
desk
in
new
york
city
presumably
he
do
know
much
in
the
big
scheme
traditional
commodity
be
manage
locally
but
there
be
a
global
market
for
they
a
member
of
the
olympic
committee
however
have
both
local
and
global
knowledge
which
resemble
more
insider
information
that
may
be
possess
by
a
few

c
suite
a
few
additional
remark
be
offer
below

nfi
statutory
interpretation
of

and
why
it
make
more
sense
that
the
alternative
interpretation
offer
by
kalshi
and
the
commission
under
nfi
interpretation
the
statutory
analysis
follow
a
logical
funnel
like
process
in
the
first
step
any
contract
that
incentivize
bad
act
be
mark
as
have
an
elevated
risk
if
they
clear
step
2
and
step
3
they
can
still
reach
the
market
but
it
be
clear
that
the
bar
be
much
high
again
this
make
sense
in
the
context
of
the
political
backlash
around
the
darpa

any
other
contract
be
a
potential
candidate
to
reach
the
market
provide
that
they
be
deem
to
serve

by
I
possess
enough
economic
purpose
through
an
application
of
the

test
and
ii
by
have
the

essentially
the
commission
be
entitle
to
two
bite
of
the
apple
analyze
not
just
the
contract
design
itself
but
also
the
trading
design
this
interpretation
be
consistent
with
legislative
history
and
be
perfectly
align
with
the
economic

congress
launch
in
the

of

it
be
one
where
the
public

naturally
weave
into

be

it
also
one
where
the
determination
of

for
both
contract

and

design
can
be
accomplish
within
the
four
corner
of

kalshi

the

admit

alternatively
if
some

disallow

unprincipled

the

sweep
in

universe
of

broadly
define

whether
it
have
any

the

be
wholly
unwarranted
nfi
that

have
no

every

evaluate
on

commissioner
mersinger
I
recognize
that
a
contract
specific
approach
to
make
public
interest
determination
regard
event
contract
may
be
difficult
and
resource
intensive
for
the
cftc
but
aside
from
my
view
that
a
contract
specific
approach
be
require
by
the
cea
it
also
be
a
well
approach
from
a
policy
perspective
precisely
because
it
would
permit
the
cftc
to
consider
these
practical
question
in
the
context
of
the
specific
circumstance
applicable
to
a
particular
event
contract
we
do
not
get
to
override
a
requirement
under
the
law
because
it
will
be
hard
or
require
more
work
for
we
nfi
the
commission
be
task
with
execute
on
the
mandate
from
congress
consumer
from
abusive
financial
service
practice
be
mean
to
be
hard
work
congress
ask
for
it
and
if
the
commission
need
more
resource
then
ask
congress
for
additional
resource
would
be
a
much
well
approach
than
interpret
the
statute
narrowly
despite
congress
not
prescribe
that
narrow
view
to
optimize
its
exist
resource
nfi
strongly
disagree
with
commissioner
mersinger
on
the
follow
point
how
to
interpret
the
fact
that
congress
do
not
enumerate
election
commissioner
mersinger
congress
easily
could
have
include
election
and
award
as
enumerate
activity
but
it
do
not
confront
with
this
congressional
silence
I
do
not
believe
the
commission
can
simply
decree
that
election
and
award
be
enumerate
activity
nfi
perhaps
the
commission
can
not
enumerate
an
activity
but
it
do
not
need
to
instead
it
can
simply
issue
a
scorecard
on
election
contract
as
it
would
for
any
other
contract
by
rely
on
the
economic
purpose
test
and
determine
whether
or
not
such
contract
constitute
gambling
congress
silence
mean
only
one
thing
that
congress
trust
the
cftc
to
do
the
job
in
simple
term
one
can
hypothesize
that
congress
mandate
be
rather
simple
and
intuitive
we
can
visualize
congre
say
pay
attention
to
terrorism
assassination
and
war
and
for
any
other
contract
where
the
payout
be
contingent
on
an
unlawful
activity
we
do
want
to
provide
the
wrong
incentive
anything
else
you
should
take
a
look
and
feel
free
to
review
more
thoroughly
if
there
be
borderline
case
finally
please
make
sure
there
be
safeguard
in
place
even
when
the
contract
have
economic
purpose
commissioner
mersinger
there
be
no
basis
to
resurrect
the
repealed
economic
purpose
test
which
should
be
apply
to
event
contract
in
any
event
nfi
this
be
our
big
disagreement
with
the
commissioner
commissioner
mersinger
denounce
the
economic
purpose
test
by
argue
I
lack
of
congressional
intent
ii
difference
in
kind
iii
government
paternalism
and
iv
application
to
category
of
contract
we
address
each
point
in
turn
I
perhaps
congressional
intent
could
have
be
clear
but
there
be
certainly
strong
sign
of
it
even
more
importantly
what
be
the
alternative
the
commissioner
do
not
really
offer
any
other
than
point
to
a
separate
process
of
detailed
rulemake
down
the
road
but
the
restoration
of
the
economic
purpose
test
offer
a
much
simple
solution
it
imply
that
the
commission
have
the
authority
here
and
now
within
the
four
corner
of
the
dodd
frank
act
as
mention
early
the
commission
not
have
access
to
the
economic
purpose
test
be
akin
to
a
teacher
not
have
the
ability
to
issue
pass
fail
grade
ii
that
event
contract
be
different
from
traditional
future
contract
be
not
a
reason
to
eliminate
the
good
tool
the
commission
have
it
be
true
that
the
application
of
it
may
be
a
little
different
perhaps
price
discovery
rather
than
price
basing
become
more
important
in
the
case
of
exclude
commodity
as
oppose
to
the
traditional
one
and
perhaps
the
potential
hedger
population
look
slightly
different
that
do
mean
that
one
can
still
broadly
look
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
public
interest
iii
it
be
true
that
participant
should
be
permit
to
make
their
own
choice
about
what
financial
product
meet
their
hedging
need
but
we
disagree
that
it
be
not
the
cftc
role
to
deny
they
that
choice
altogether
because
we
feel
a
give
product
hedging
value
be
limited
if
it
not
the
cftc
whose
role
be
it
should
all
product
simply
allow
to
trade
because
there
might
be
a
few
hedger
in
a
pool
of
million
speculator
and
there
be
no
meaningful
price
discovery
in
any
event
there
be
evidence
of
industry
participant
advocate
for
their
need
and
make
a
difference
when
a
hearing
be
hold
for
the
box
office
movie
future
nfi
recall
that
there
be
a
film
financier
who
passionately
argue
why
such
contract
should
be
allow
despite
strong
opposition
by
the
mpaa
those
contract
be
vote
to
reach
the

with
then
chair
gary
gensler
be
the

ironically
they
be
later
outlaw
by

in
short
there
can
be
other
way
for
true
hedger
to
advocate
for
their
need
and
make
a
difference
iv
nfi
agree
with
commissioner
mersinger
that
make

by

do
not
make

in
sum
if
the

to

seem
to
have
it
backwards
and
seem
to
be
conflate

nobody
perhaps
other
than

which
effectively
try
to
backdoor
sport
gambling
through

by
disingenuously
argue
that
the

be
suggest
that
the
commission
should
register
las

and
other

instead
the
commission
should
evaluate
whether
sport
bet
contract
should
be
characterize
as
swap
event
contract
nfi
believe
that
be
the
case
for
both
however
a
detailed
analysis
of
why
sport

and
even
daily
fantasy
sport
should
be
characterize
as

be
beyond
the
scope
of
this
comment
letter
and
if
it
believe
it
do
should
assert
jurisdiction
from
a
layman
perspective
it
do
not
make
intuitive
sense
why
the
commission
could
have
such
strong
opinion
and
clear
jurisdiction
on
whether
a
particular
candidate
will
win
the
election
but
not
on
whether
a
particular
team
will
win
the
super
bowl
if
the
mere
answer
be
that
the
cftc
be
not
willing
to
take
a
stance
against
a
powerful
sport
bet
lobby
the
answer
seem
political
not
principle
core
to
commissioner
pham
thesis
seem
to
be
the
premise
that
gaming
be
a
power
reserve
to
the
state
as
mention
early
we
fully
agree
where
we
disagree
be
the
characterization
of
sport
bet
as
game
it
gamble
not
game
and
that
subtle
but
crucial
distinction
flip
who
have
jurisdiction
be
football
an
exclude
commodity
at
least
one
cftc
commissioner
think
so
when
we
think
of
commodity
we
think
of
tangible
thing
oil

gold
there
be
intangible
commodity
too
most
of
which
have
a
connection
to
the
financial
system
like
a

but
what
about

whether

those
too

on

they
certainly
be
that
put
they
squarely
within
the
cftc
jurisdictional
perimeter
at
time
the
commission
seem
to
suggest
that
it
only
care
about
sport
bet
contract
not
trade
on
register
exchange
as
oppose
to
any
venue
certainly
that
create
the
wrong
incentive
to
market
participant
all
kalshi
would
need
to
do
be
create
a
new
entity
and
offer
election
contract
trading
at
least
in
state
that
do
not
disallow
it
that
simply
can
be
an
outcome
the
commission
would
be
comfortable
with
in
addition
the
commission
have
already
take
action
against
various
unregistered
exchange
in
the
past
and
to
not
do
so
against
sport

platform
seem
to
be
a
selective
enforcement
activity
thus
the
fact
that
the
cftc
pick
a
battle
with
election
contract
but
not
sport
bet
or
daily
fantasy
sport
operator
appear
to
be
guide
by

not
by
