this
have
lead
to
the
development
of

that
provide

the
critical

and

to
that
end
the
sba
make
three
request
regard
the
propose
rule
first
the
sba
respectfully
request
that
the
cftc
clarify
that
the
propose
rule
be
not
intend
to
conflict
with
gaming
activity
regulate
by
the
state
in
order
to
prevent
any
potential
destabilization
of
state
regulate
sport
bet
second
the
cftc
should
confirm
that
game
itself
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
demonstrate
by
the
widespread
adoption
of
the
activity
across
the
country
third
and
finally
the
commission
should
allow
for
an
institutional
future
market
accessible
to
license
sport
bet
operator
currently
the
propose
rule
overlook
the
compelling
economic
purpose
that
an
institutional
future
market
could
serve
in
allow
operator
to
hedge
commercial
risk
label
any
contract
involve
gaming
as
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
will
limit
the
industry
hedge
ability
a
move
that
we
believe
have
not
be
sufficiently
consider
by
the
cftc
we
object
to
the
propose
rule
to
the
extent
it
foreclose
an
institutional
future
market
for
this
purpose
we
strongly
advocate
for
meaningful
discussion
between
our
member
other
relevant
company
within
the
sport
wagering
and
sport
industry
and
the
cftc
these
discussion
be
essential
to
address
the
complexity
of
the
industry
and
ensure
that
any
regulatory
measure
be
well
informed
and
balance
such
collaborative
engagement
should
precede
the
enactment
of
broad
and
categorical
rule
that
may
have
far
reach
implication
we
respectfully
urge
the
cftc
to
refrain
from
approve
this
rule
in
its
current
form
due
to
its
unconditional
nature
and
its
potential
harm
to
a
multi
billion
dollar
industry
and
the
ten
of
million
of
consumer
that
currently
enjoy
legal
regulated
bet
on
sporting
event
we
believe
that
with
further
examination
and
open
dialogue
a
more
nuanced
approach
can
be
develop
that
safeguard
the
public
interest
while
support
the
stability
and
growth
of
the
regulate
sport
bet
industry
thank
you
for
consider
our
comment
we
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
constructive
discussion
with
the
commission

this
critical
issue
