dear
kirkpatrick
thank
you
for
provide
an
opportunity
for
public
comment
I
be
write
to
express
opposition
to
both
the
categorical
classification
of
contract
involve
gaming
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
result
prohibition
that
would
engender
for
certain
type
of
swap
a
subset
of
professional
sport
team
be
currently
consider
a
category
of
otc
swap
that
be
be
develop
to
help
those
team
mitigate
the
financial
risk
of
player
underperformance
these
swap
which
would
be
execute
between
eligible
contract
participant
would
settle
base
on
the
longitudinal
statistical
performance
of
an
athlete
whose
contract
would
be
hedge
they
be
be
design
as
an
alternative
to
disability
insurance
that
go
beyond
just
injury
protection
allow
team
to
hedge
against
the
financial
risk
of
player
underperformance
regardless
of
the
source
of
that
underperformance
I
believe
the
listing
for
trading
and
availability
for
clearing
of
those
swap
through
register
swap
execution
facility
would
provide
a
more
efficient
market
for
a
legitimate
form
of
business
risk
hedge
the
utility
of
which
would
be
in
the
public
interest
I
far
believe
that
at
least
for
that
category
of
contract
hedge
utility
should
be
a
consider
factor
when
determine
whether
a
contract
be
contrary
to
public
interest
what
we
do
reifi
be
seek
to
build
product
that
mitigate
financial
risk
inherent
to
pro
athlete
contract
athlete
salary
be
often
guarantee
and
as
a
result
team
undertake
large
long
term
financial
risk
when
sign
professional
athlete
to
contract
a
player
could
experience
a
career
end
injury
early
on
in
their
contract
or
they
could
simply
fail
to
live
up
to
performance
expectation
for
a
plethora
of
reason
outside
of
the
team
and
player
control
these
be
not
hypothetical
occurrence
particularly
in
major
league
baseball
where
collective
bargaining
have
secure
guarantee
full
payment
of
player
contract
regardless
of
the
player
eventual
performance
prior
to
the
2020
mlb
season
the
washington
national
sign
pitcher
stephen
strasburg
to
a
245
m
7
year
contract
an
injury
severely
hamper
the
first
two
season
of
that
contract
and
then
effectively
end
strasburg
career
mid
way
through
the
following
season
in
2014
the
boston
red
sox
sign
rusney
castillo
to
a
m
7
year
contract
castillo
do
not
face
any
major
injury
concern
but
fail
to
perform
up
to
expectation
for
two
season
before
be
move
down
to
the
minor
league
system
for
the
remainder
of
the
contract
this
all
lead
to
highly
inefficient
salary
spend
for
pro
sport
team
accord
to
reifi
analysis
mlb
team
spend
a
project
or
33
of
total
payroll
spend
on
injured
or
underperform
player
during
the
2023
season
the
only
product
that
team
currently
have
access
to
for
hedge
these
risk
come
in
the
form
of
disability
insurance
which
protect
against
the
risk
of
some
injury
relate
underperformance
but
not
against
the
risk
of
other
form
of
underperformance
team
executive
have
tell
reifi
that
the
disability
insurance
market
have
be
dry
up
over
the
last
decade
in
addition
to
rise
price
policy
have
generally
start
to
exclude
certain
injury
and
require
waiting
period
of
60
90
in
the
case
of
stephen
strasburg
it
be
report
that
the
national
be
unable
to
secure
disability
insurance
due
to
the
prohibitive
cost
of
such
coverage
in
the
case
of
rusney
castillo
there
be
no
currently
available
product
that
can
protect
team
from
the
financial
sink
cost
of
uninjured
underperform
player
team
executive
have
also
tell
reifi
that
they
have
even
request
insurer
build
they
a
product
base
on
player
performance
and
not
just
injury
but
that
the
underwriter
note
among
other
reason
that
their
insurance
product
be
poorly
structure
to
account
for
multi
variable
outcome
such
as
player
performance
as
oppose
to
binary
outcome
such
as
injury
these
inefficient
salary
expense
be
ultimately
pass
on
to
consumer
in
the
form
of
increase
ticket
merchandise
and
concession
price
as
well
as
a
saturation
of
ad
distract
from
the
onfield
entertainment
product
as
a
result
an
inability
to
hedge
these
business
risk
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
be
in
this
market
vacuum
that
reifi
have
be
work
to
build
financial
product
that
help
pro
sport
team
mitigate
the
financial
risk
of
athlete
underperformance
it
be
in
the
context
of
player
performance
a
multivariable
outcome
with
economic
implication
that
reifi
seek
to
utilize
a
derivative
contract
to
handle
situation
that
insurance
be
poorly
structure
to
solve
with
the
propose
product
team
would
pay
a
premium
to
institutional
investor
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
to
hedge
against
the
underperformance
of
one
of
their
player
against
a
predetermined
benchmark
if
the
player
meet
that
benchmark
during
the
season
the
investor
keep
the
premium
but
if
the
player
fall
short
the
investor
reimburse
the
team
an
amount
proportional
to
the
shortfall
beyond
just
mitigate
risk
and
ensure
fiscal
stability
the
goal
of
the
product
would
be
to
enable
team
to
sign
franchise
altering
player
that
can
drive
more
win
clinch
playoff
berth
and
get
fan
into
the
seat
while
also
rebound
financially
if
thing
do
go
accord
to
plan
for
the
institutional
investor
serve
as
counterpartie
these
product
would
offer
the
potential
for
a
return
that
be
uncorrelated
with
the
broad
market
these
product
would
be
operationalize
as
swap
contract
that
settle
base
on
the
longitudinal
statistical
performance
of
a
player
over
the
course
of
one
or
more
season
they
would
be
enter
into
solely
by
eligible
contract
participant
and
league
rule
would
prohibit
team
from
any
secondary
trading
of
those
swap
contract
in
order
to
prevent
perverse
incentive
and
the
team
manipulation
of
a
player
performance
the
settlement
amount
would
be
structure
such
that
the
economic
benefit
of
player
underperformance
would
always
be
less
than
the
economic
benefit
of
a
perform
player
additionally
performance
would
be
measure
use
a
composite
statistic
that
take
month
for
a
player
to
accumulate
this
prevent
any
quick
win
where
a
team
could
negatively
affect
a
player
aggregate
performance
statistic
in
a
short
period
of
time
in
order
to
secure
a
large
settlement
amount
any
long
term
attempt
from
a
team
to
negatively
affect
player
performance
would
generally
be
protect
against
in
each
league
respective
collective
bargaining
agreement
where
current
rule
proposal
would
prohibit
future
activity
in
the
public
interest
in
the
future
to
operationalize
the
propose
product
reifi
would
seek
to
register
as
a
licensed
broker
dealer
and
believe
it
would
be
beneficial
to
list
the
propose
contract
for
trading
and
make
they
available
for
clear
on
cftc
register
swap
execution
facility
we
expect
that
by
solicit
multiple
bid
for
each
contract
and
by
create
a
secondary
market
these
contract
could
be
more
competitively
price
lower
cost
for
pro
sport
team
and
make
it
easy
to
hedge
their
business
risk
relate
to
player
underperformance
reifi
hold
that
these
contract
which
would
be
enter
into
solely
by
eligible
contract
participant
on
swap
execution
facility
and
from
which
team
would
be
prohibit
from
trading
would
avoid
many
of
the
concern
the
commision
have
voice
about
other
form
of
contract
involve
gaming
reifi
comment
the
commision
elaborate
on
multiple
public
interest
determination
with
respect
to
contract
involve
gaming
and
request
comment
on
whether
there
be
contract
that
may
involve
game
that
do
not
raise
those
public
interest
concern
reifi
believe
that
the
contract
elucidate
in
the
prior
section
would
avoid
those
public
interest
concern
and
would
be
in
the
public
interest
namely
the
commission
in
effect
note
that
contract
involve
gaming
have
the
follow
public
interest
concern
which
I
have
reply
to
in
turn
the
economic
impact
be
generally
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
change
in
the
price
of
a
related
derivative
limit
the
hedge
utility
of
that
derivative
decade
of
rigorous
statistical
analysis
conduct
by
pro
sport
team
particularly
in
the
mlb
have
generate
a
consensus
on
the
monetary
cost
team
be
willing
to
pay
for
a
give
unit
of
performance
on
the
free
agent
market
home
run
strike
out
win
above
replacement
etc
reifi
propose
contract
directly
recycle
that
framework
to
enable
team
to
hedge
against
underperformance
and
the
related
cost
with
a
swap
that
explicitly
settle
base
on
the
player
statistical
performance
and
the
related
monetary
value
of
that
performance
as
a
result
the
price
of
reifi
propose
contract
directly
and
linearly
correlate
with
the
observable
longitudinal
on
field
performance
of
the
player
in
question
such
contract
will
predominantly
be
trade
to
enable
gambling
or
be
use
by
speculator
who
either
have
no
or
at
good
have
only
occasional
commercial
or
hedge
interest
reifi
propose
contract
would
be
enter
into
solely
by
a
team
which
be
explicitly
seek
to
hedge
business
risk
and
one
or
more
institutional
investor
all
of
whom
would
be
eligible
contract
participant
with
the
transaction
occur
through
a
cftc
register
swap
execution
facility
such
contract
will
have
only
a
small
universe
of
participant
with
predictable
economic
consequence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
and
that
the
majority
of
participant
will
only
be
seek
entertainment
purpose
the
plurality
of
participant
in
reifi
propose
contract
would
be
pro
sport
team
who
explicitly
seek
to
hedge
business
risk
the
remain
participant
would
be
institutional
investor
seek
a
net
positive
expect
return
that
would
be
uncorrelated
with
the
broad
market
the
small
universe
of

with

in

with
a

or
game
be
likely
to
have
access
to
information
influence
that
can
be
use
to
artificially
move
or
manipulate
the
market
the
pro
sport
team
in
question
for
reifi
propose
contract
would
be
prohibit
from
any
secondary
trading
of
such
contract
the
individual
who
have
influence
in
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
contest
even
if
prohibit
from
trade
such
contract
will
be
vulnerable
to
pressure
or
persuasion
by
other
who
have
take
a
position
in
the
contract
for
reifi
propose
contract
the
team
coach
staff
and
the
player
themselves
would
be
the
prohibit
from
trading
individual
who
would
have
influence
on
the
player
longitudinal
performance
the
incentive
of
the
institutional
investor
and
both
the
player
and
the
team
coach
staff
would
be
align
the
institutional
investor
earn
a
net
positive
return
when
the
player
in
question
be
healthy
and
perform
well
the
team
coach
staff
be
charge
with
put
together
a
healthy
team
that
perform
well
if
they
fail
to
do
so
they
be
generally
fire
and
become
progressively
less
hireable
a
similar
dynamic
exist
for
the
player
themselves
thus
it
be
in
the
interest
of
the
career
of
both
the
player
and
the
coach
staff
for
the
player
in
question
to
remain
healthy
and
perform
well
furthermore
reifi
will
reiterate
that
the
settlement
amount
would
be
structure
such
that
the
economic
benefit
of

would
always
be
less
than
the

in
order
to

any

attempt
from
a

to

performance
would
generally
be
protect

such

have

rather
price

be
either

the

such

could
cause

to
