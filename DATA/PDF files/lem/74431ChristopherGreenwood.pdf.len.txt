good

your

my

with

margaret

and
conor
daly
the
court
good
afternoon
everyone
so
we
be
here
on
the
party
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment
I
do
typically
have
oral
argument
although
I
think
this
be
a
case
where
argument
would
be
helpful
to
I
in
resolve
the
motion
I
do
know
who
argue
for
plaintiff
be
there
a
time
sensitivity
in
this
case
I
know
there
not
a
pi
that
be
file
but
I
just
try
to
understand
mr
roth
it
be
actually
the
first
thing
I
be
go
to
say
be
thank
you
for
hear
argument
on
motion
we
have
ask
for
a
preliminary
injunction
but
there
be
time
some
time
sensitivity
because
the
contract
be
tie
to
the
november
election
so
what
we
would
like
ideally
be
a
resolution
that
would
allow
if
need
for
appellate
intervention
so
that
the
contract
can
be
list
prior
to
that
election
the
court
that
be
my
preliminary
question
all
right
I
will
start
with
plaintiff
I
may
interrupt
with
some
question
but
otherwise
will
try
to
restrain
myself
to
listen
to
your
presentation
mr
roth
great
thank
you
so
much
your
honor
so
as
your
honor
know
we
file
this
case
because
the
commission
block
kalshi
from
list
its
event
contract
that
turn
on
partisan
control
of
the
house
and
the
senate
and
the
question
for
the
court
be
whether
that
agency
action
complie
with
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
the
apa
and
we
reproduce
on
a
slide
here
the
text
of
the
key
statutory
provision
from
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
as
you
see
it
authorize
the
commission
to
block
prohibit
the
listing
of
event
contract
if
two
element
be
satisfied
first
the
contract
have
to
involve
one
of
the
six
enumerate
category
of
activity
and
then
if
it
do
the
commission
may
determine
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
which
case
it
prohibit
so
far
I
do
think
that
a
point
of
dispute
that
just
what
the
statute
say
follow
that
framework
our
challenge
here
have
two
basic
component
first
we
do
dispute
that
kalshi
contract
fall
within
the
scope
of
those
six
any
of
those
six
enumerate
category
and
that
really
just
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
then
the
second
piece
be
that
we
argue
that
even
assume
the
contract
do
fall
within
one
of
those
category
that
commission
public
interest
analysis
be
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
court
I
know
I
say
I
be
go
to
restrain
myself
but
can
I
ask
just
a
preliminary
question
I
understand
your
argument
to
be
because
of
this
two
step
framework
that
the
statute
set
forth
that
if
it
not
in
I
say
enumerate
although
the
last
one
be
a
catchall
in
not
one
of
these
category
then
you
do
even
get
to
public
interest
I
notice
in
your
brief
you
have
outline
some
of
the
safeguard
that
you
client
have
put
in
into
place
with
respect
to
this
contract
in
particular
for
example
pay
member
of
congressional
staff
be
permit
to
trade
other
safeguard
I
assume
that
your
client
think
those
be
important
to
maintain
integrity
of
the
process
mr
roth
correct
the
court
but
under
your
argument
because
election
do
fall
accord
to
you
in
these
category
there
no
occasion
for
cftc
to
even
reach
those
safeguard
so
presumably
someone
could
post
an
event
contract
similarly
to
what
your
client
do
another
dcm
could
do
this
without
any
of
those
safeguard
and
it
my
understanding
that
under
your
framework
cftc
would
not
have
any
interest
in
that
mr
roth
I
agree
that
it
would
be
relevant
to
whether
it
fall
within
one
of
these
statutory
category
and
therefore
this
provision
would
not
capture
it
what
I
not
sure
about
and
what
I
can
ask
be
whether
there
be
other
regulation
or
provision
that
may
the
court
come
into
play
mr
roth
yeah
that
may
speak
to
issue
like
that
like
who
allow
to
trade
on
it
be
there
certain
restriction
beyond
this
sort
of
in
or
out
provision
which
be
just
it
either
allow
or
it
not
allow
the
court
on
a
similar
vein
I
understand
one
of
your
position
to
be
look
this
be
a
contract
involve
control
of
the
house
it
not
talk
about
a
discrete
election
between
two
candidate
there
be
so
many
intervene
factor
that
have
to
occur
before
not
even
intervene
factor
but
it
not
often
dispositive
of
one
election
who
control
the
chamber
under
your
framework
though
would
a
dcm
be
able
to
post
an
event
contract
for
a
presidential
election
mr
roth
yes
the
court
okay
so
that
piece
be
responsive
or
relevant
to
what
your
point
about
this
be
a
house
about
control
of
the
house
and
that
it
not
you
know
a
two
party
or
two
candidate
election
there
a
lot
of
move
part
what
be
that
relevant
to
mr
roth
let
I
try
to
answer
it
this
way
the
court
okay
mr
roth
if
you
imagine
that
there
be
a
category
on
this
list
that
say
election
the
court
okay
mr
roth
then
I
think
one
could
still
say
that
these
contract
involve
election
even
though
it
one
step
remove
from
the
election
itself
the
court
okay
mr
roth
which
go
to
an
issue
that
be
sort
of
debate
in
the
brief
which
be
do
it
have
be
to
be
literally
the
underlie
event
or
do
it
have
to
do
this
underlying
event
just
have
to
relate
to
the
category
we
agree
it
enough
that
it
relate
to
the
category
so
if
you
have
the
category
that
say
election
even
though
this
be
a
couple
step
remove
I
think
you
could
say
it
would
relate
to
election
and
therefore
fall
within
the
scope
our
main
argument
though
be
it
do
say
election
the
court
all
right
continue
please
mr
roth
okay
what
I
be
go
to
say
before
move
on
be
I
go
to
be
speak
to
the
statutory
interpretation
piece
of
the
argument
and
my
colleague
amanda
rice
be
go
to
be
speak
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
piece
when
I
done
look
to
the
enumerate
category
we
can
sort
of
simplify
by
take
four
of
they
off
the
list
right
off
the
bat
the
last
one
as
your
honor
note
be
a
catchall
the
commission
be
essentially
allow
to
add
category
by
rule
if
they
similar
to
the
list
five
the
commission
have
do
that
so
we
can
sort
of
cross
that
one
off
the
list
for
now
and
then
obviously
the
commission
do
not
argue
that
these
contract
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
they
do
think
involve
be
very
broad
but
not
broad
enough
to
get
they
quite
that
far
so
we
can
strike
two
three
and
four
from
the
list
as
well
and
that
leave
the
two
enumerate
category
that
the
commission
focus
on
which
be
number
1
unlawful
activity
and
then
number
five
gaming
and
I
like
to
take
they
in
that
order
which
be
the
order
they
appear
in
the
statute
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
start
with
the
unlawful
activity
the
way
we
understand
that
be
that
it
refer
to
contract
where
the
underlying
event
relate
to
some
unlawful
act
okay
so
for
example
if
you
have
a
contract
on
whether
the
murder
rate
in
2024
be
go
exceed
a
certain
level
if
you
have
a
contract
on
whether
a
particular
piece
of
art
in
the
national
gallery
be
go
to
be
steal
within
a
period
of
time
those
be
unlawful
act
if
you
have
a
contract
on
those
event
it
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
number
one
I
think
it
fit
the
text
and
I
think
it
fit
the
context
of
the
statute
and
that
sort
of
an
important
point
it
align
it
with
the
terrorism
assassination
and
war
provision
that
immediately
follow
it
if
you
think
about
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
common
denominator
be
they
bad
those
be
thing
we
do
they
bad
thing
congress
be
concerned
about
people
profit
from
bad
thing
and
about
incentive
to
do
bad
thing
right
use
my
hypothetical
of
the
murder
rate
you
do
want
somebody
to
go
hire
a
hit
man
to
get
the
rate
above
a
level
so
you
can
make
money
bad
incentive
it
also
just
feel
offensive
to
have
people
profit
from
you
know
there
be
a
terrorist
attack
I
go
to
make
a
lot
of
money
from
that
that
sort
of
the
gist
of
2
3
and
4
if
you
read
1
the
way
we
read
1
it
line
up
perfectly
with
that
we
do
want
to
incentivize
crime
we
do
want
to
have
people
profit
from
crime
so
it
all
parallel
and
of
course
that
interpretation
do
sweep
in
kalshi
contract
election
be
not
unlawful
they
do
even
relate
to
unlawful
activity
so
now
let
consider
the
commission
interpretation
as
I
understand
it
on
this
prong
what
they
say
be
some
state
prohibit
bet
on
election
either
as
part
of
their
gambling
statute
or
in
stand
alone
provision
and
the
commission
admit
that
those
state
law
do
directly
apply
in
the
sense
that
they
can
prohibit
trading
on
a
regulated
exchange
because
of
preemption
principle
but
the
way
I
understand
what
they
argue
be
that
they
say
well
buy
and
sell
those
contract
sort
of
amount
to
a
betting
on
an
election
because
you
stake
something
of
value
on
the
electoral
outcome
if
you
do
that
outside
the
context
of
a
regulated
exchange
then
it
would
violate
these
state
law
and
therefore
the
trading
of
the
contract
relate
to
unlawful
activity
so
a
couple
problem
with
that
number
one
unlike
our
interpretation
it
do
align
with
the
three
that
follow
it
because
the
key
move
that
they
make
there
be
instead
of
look
at
the
underlie
event
and
whether
it
be
relate
to
the
enumerate
activity
they
look
at
the
trading
of
the
contract
and
whether
it
relate
to
the
underlie
activity
that
be
a
sort
of
just
a
different
focus
of
the
analysis
and
it
make
1
sort
of
stand
out
relative
to
2
3
and
4
the
court
can
I
ask
you
about
that
because
I
think
that
this
defendant
make
this
point
the
government
make
this
point
where
it
say
agreement
contract
or
transaction
involve
what
work
do
you
argue
transaction
be
do
in
the
statute
as
it
relate
to
involve
mr
roth
as
I
understand
it
the
agreement
contract
or
transaction
sort
of
triplet
it
appear
throughout
the
statute
it
just
the
way
they
refer
to
these
type
of
instrument
when
they
define
it
so
I
do
think
that
they
have
independent
significance
I
think
they
just
capture
any
different
way
you
might
structure
the
arraignment
the
court
so
you
not
read
transaction
to
refer
to
the
act
of
trade
the
thing
it
another
way
to
say
contract
agreement
it
be
the
contract
itself
mr
roth
it
the
instrument
and
I
think
that
follow
from
the
fact
that
this
be
how
it
use
throughout
the
statute
the
three
together
and
just
to
be
clear
we
not
say
that
you
could
have
a
statute
that
say
transaction
involve
x
where
what
it
mean
be
the
act
of
contracting
it
involve
that
activity
it
not
that
that
semantically
impossible
it
grammatically
appropriate
it
make
sense
it
just
that
it
do
line
up
with
the
way
the
statute
work
for
2
3
and
4
and
so
it
make
it
just
an
unusual
sort
of
strange
way
of
speak
the
hypothetical
I
be
think
about
as
I
be
prepare
you
could
say
my
lunch
generally
involve
a
sandwich
a
salad
a
pastry
or
robust
conversation
with
my
work
colleague
you
could
say
that
and
yes
it
could
involve
those
thing
but
put
they
together
in
that
way
be
weird
it
not
the
way
people
normally
speak
but
I
actually
do
think
that
the
most
problematic
aspect
of
the
commission
reading
of
the
unlawful
category
I
think
the
most
serious
problem
with
it
and
the
one
that
really
be
I
think
fatal
be
that
it
prove
way
too
much
because
as
the
commission
observe
elsewhere
in
the
briefing
there
be
a
whole
lot
of
state
that
prohibit
bet
on
any
contingent
event
if
we
go
to
the
second
slide
we
collect
they
there
at
least
29
that
we
find
that
prohibit
stake
something
of
value
on
an
uncertain
event
or
contingency
and
of
course
that
define
an
event
contract
it
would
mean
that
every
event
contract
fall
within
the
scope
of
roman
I
and
would
involve
unlawful
activity
and
that
just
can
be
right
because
it
make
the
other
five
enumerate
activity
superfluous
and
it
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
have
enumerate
activity
in
the
first
place
because
it
would
allow
the
commission
to
subject
every
event
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
so
every
kind
of
interpretation
tell
we
that
wrong
and
so
do
the
statutory
history
because
sort
of
notably
prior
to
2000
that
be
how
the
statute
work
if
we
go
to
the
next
slide
we
have
that
language
they
actually
have
to
make
this
public
interest
determination
for
every
contract
that
be
repeal
in
2000
and
then
in
2010
congress
enact
this
more
limit
provision
that
single
out
the
category
so
I
think
anything
that
cover
the
waterfront
be
necessarily
an
erroneous
interpretation
I
think
the
commission
actually
admit
that
they
say
on
page
11
of
their
final
reply
brief
that
sure
you
can
read
any
of
these
to
cover
everything
that
would
not
be
tenable
and
so
they
try
to
explain
why
their
interpretation
do
do
that
and
just
to
be
candid
I
do
really
understand
what
they
try
to
do
there
to
I
if
kalshi
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
because
some
state
prohibit
bet
on
election
then
all
event
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
because
some
state
ban
bet
on
contingent
event
so
I
think
the
bottom
line
on
number
1
be
our
interpretation
be
the
only
one
that
sort
of
make
sense
in
context
that
give
this
provision
real
work
to
do
without
swallow
everything
else
the
court
can
you
respond
and
apology
if
it
in
your
reply
the
commission
give
an
example
of
a
circumstance
in
which
they
would
say
a
contract
involve
war
without
the
underlie
event
actually
be
about
war
and
I
think
the
example
they
give
be
whether
the
ukrainian
military
will
acquire
certain
munition
in
2024
can
you
speak
to
that
example
they
say
well
that
would
be
under
their
broad
reading
involve
something
that
relate
to
war
but
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
be
not
itself
an
act
of
war
mr
roth
that
may
have
be
our
example
I
not
sure
because
I
think
we
agree
with
that
it
may
have
be
theirs
the
court
maybe
it
be
your
example
sorry
mr
roth
I
not
sure
it
a
point
where
the
party
disagree
I
think
it
go
to
the
difference
between
involve
and
base
on
the
court
I
think
that
be
your
example
mr
roth
so
base
on
would
speak
literally
about
the
underlying
event
that
too
narrow
for
this
this
say
involve
so
there
this
broader
scope
our
point
be
that
the
broad
scope
be
tethered
around
the
event
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
you
still
look
at
the
event
and
say
do
the
event
relate
to
unlawful
activity
do
it
relate
to
war
do
it
relate
to
terrorism
so
you
can
sort
of
game
it
by
circumvent
by
sort
of
make
it
technically
something
that
just
a
proxy
it
would
capture
this
the
court
I
just
want
you
to
flesh
that
out
okay
mr
roth
okay
the
court
so
when
they
say
that
you
read
or
use
the
word
involve
too
narrowly
you
would
dispute
that
you
not
dispute
that
involve
mean
relate
to
all
those
other
dictionary
definition
of
involve
it
just
relate
to
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
mr
roth
it
what
have
to
involve
we
do
actually
disagree
on
what
involve
mean
we
disagree
on
what
have
to
involve
what
right
it
a
subtle
but
important
point
okay
that
take
we
through
roman
unless
your
honor
have
further
question
about
unlawful
activity
I
move
to
gaming
which
be
the
second
one
that
they
argue
again
the
fight
be
about
what
do
game
mean
in
this
statutory
context
our
core
point
be
really
simple
gaming
require
a
game
so
if
there
no
underlying
game
there
no
gaming
and
so
for
example
if
you
have
a
contract
on
who
go
to
win
the
kentucky
derby
that
a
game
it
a
horse
race
it
a
game
if
you
have
an
event
contract
on
who
go
to
win
the
super
bowl
or
the
point
spread
in
the
super
bowl
it
involve
a
game
there
an
underlying
game
same
thing
with
the
lottery
they
have
an
underlying
game
that
form
the
basis
for
the
contract
and
if
you
read
it
and
you
understand
it
that
way
I
think
there
be
a
number
of
benefit
to
that
number
one
go
back
to
what
we
be
talk
about
early
it
line
it
up
with
the
other
in
the
sense
that
there
be
this
connection
back
to
the
underlie
event
rather
than
just
talk
about
the
act
of
trading
in
isolation
number
two
I
think
be
most
consistent
with
the
text
the
root
word
of
gaming
be
game
I
think
it
align
with
the
legislative
history
the
famous
colloquy
that
get
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefing
between
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
which
by
the
way
if
your
honor
want
to
watch
it
on
c
span
you
will
be
able
to
find
it
I
think
it
be
insert
in
writing
after
the
fact
it
be
literally
a
colloquy
but
you
can
see
it
in
the
congressional
record
and
they
give
three
example
of
gaming
contract
football
horseracing
and
golf
they
all
game
I
do
think
that
an
accident
I
think
that
interpretation
make
sense
too
because
what
be
a
game
it
something
that
have
no
inherent
economic
significance
it
something
that
be
do
for
amusement
it
may
be
do
for
sport
it
may
be
do
purely
to
facilitate
the
bet
itself
right
for
its
own
sake
so
I
think
it
make
sense
for
congress
to
have
think
about
that
category
contract
that
involve
game
be
probably
not
the
type
of
contract
that
we
want
to
be
list
on
an
exchange
because
they
do
have
any
real
economic
value
to
they
but
again
what
tie
that
together
be
the
existence
of
the
game
because
the
game
be
the
thing
that
do
have
intrinsic
economic
significance
now
of
course
election
be
not
game
they
not
do
for
amusement
they
not
do
for
sport
they
not
do
to
facilitate
bet
election
matter
they
determine
our
government
they
determine
our
governance
nobody
would
really
call
they
game
so
in
our
view
a
contract
relate
to
an
election
be
not
game
the
court
I
have
never
before
this
case
consider
the
difference
between
gaming
and
gambling
but
I
love
to
hear
more
about
your
position
on
that
because
I
do
look
at
the
various
dictionary
definition
just
to
understand
what
these
word
mean
that
I
have
use
many
time
and
there
be
some
definition
that
you
would
say
cross
reference
and
they
say
define
as
gamble
so
I
understand
your
position
to
be
sure
gaming
be
part
of
gambling
but
gambling
be
not
game
or
gaming
be
a
subset
of
gambling
gambling
be
not
synonymous
with
game
mr
roth
I
do
think
that
the
well
understanding
of
the
way
the
term
relate
I
think
gaming
have
this
more
close
tie
to
the
game
whereas
gambling
can
have
a
broad
meaning
I
will
say
when
I
go
through
the
dictionary
definition
closely
what
I
find
be
I
think
this
be
important
even
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
gambling
there
generally
two
different
definition
that
be
offer
in
the
dictionary
there
a
narrow
one
and
there
a
broad
one
so
for
example
the
merriam
webster
the
first
definition
of
gamble
be
to
play
a
game
for
money
or
property
the
second
definition
be
to
stake
something
on
a
contingency
or
take
a
chance
okay
so
you
get
one
definition
that
be
tie
to
a
game
and
then
one
definition
that
be
not
tie
to
a
game
and
the
same
be
true
of
the
concise
oxford
english
dictionary
which
I
think
be
also
cite
in
the
brief
two
definition
of
gamble
number
one
play
game
of
chance
for
money
number
two
take
risky
action
in
the
hope
of
a
desire
result
I
think
that
sort
of
fair
there
be
two
different
way
of
understand
gamble
one
be
tie
to
the
existence
of
a
game
and
one
be
just
colloquially
sort
of
broad
right
a
betting
I
think
what
important
here
be
that
the
broad
definition
do
not
work
for
the
same
reason
we
talk
about
early
if
you
sort
of
adopt
and
import
the
broad
definition
of
gambling
and
treat
any
contract
that
involve
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
or
an
uncertain
outcome
then
you
cover
the
waterfront
of
event
contract
and
so
that
can
be
the
right
interpretation
of
gaming
in
the
statute
and
I
think
that
leave
we
with
the
narrow
interpretation
in
the
dictionary
which
incorporate
the
concept
of
a
game
now
the
cftc
they
recognize
this
problem
with
the
broad
definition
and
actually
not
I
do
fully
understand
this
from
the
order
but
from
the
briefing
it
become
clear
they
sort
of
disclaim
the
broad
definition
because
they
understand
that
that
do
work
in
context
and
so
instead
they
sort
of
offer
a
intermediate
approach
where
they
say
well
it
do
require
bet
on
a
game
or
a
contest
and
then
they
say
an
election
be
a
contest
so
voila
there
we
go
it
fit
in
the
brief
we
walk
through
each
step
of
that
logic
what
I
like
to
here
be
offer
a
few
high
level
observation
on
that
argument
because
when
you
take
a
step
back
especially
I
think
it
just
too
clever
by
half
it
sort
of
this
lawyerly
attempt
to
parse
it
and
get
it
in
it
not
really
a
serious
attempt
at
statutory
interpretation
I
just
offer
a
few
reason
for
that
number
1
if
congress
be
really
try
to
get
at
election
contract
the
easy
way
to
do
that
would
have
be
to
have
a
roman
vi
or
vii
that
say
election
very
easy
one
word
to
say
that
they
be
try
to
do
it
by
say
gaming
which
some
definition
cross
reference
gambling
which
you
could
say
involve
a
game
or
contest
it
the
most
attenuated
way
of
get
at
this
so
strained
that
I
do
think
it
very
credible
second
point
be
there
no
support
for
this
in
the
legislative
history
the
colloquy
again
it
all
game
nothing
about
politic
third
if
you
look
at
where
they
get
the
word
contest
from
it
really
instructive
because
they
pull
it
from
a
few
state
statute
and
if
we
pull
up
we
get
the
text
of
a
couple
of
the
sample
of
those
but
it
very
clear
when
you
look
at
they
that
they
talk
about
contest
that
be
like
game
so
for
example
this
be
the
delaware
their
version
which
be
also
materially
identical
to
florida
and
they
talk
about
bet
or
wager
on
the
result
of
any
trial
or
contest
wherever
conduct
of
skill
speed
or
power
of
endurance
or
human
or
beast
I
suppose
there
be
some
candidate
for
office
who
may
be
describe
as
beast
but
it
really
not
I
just
do
think
anyone
would
say
in
this
context
of
the
statute
contest
mean
election
just
like
you
would
say
in
the
context
of
the
statute
that
trial
mean
a
trial
in
this
courtroom
that
not
what
this
be
about
same
thing
if
you
look
at
the
next
this
be
the
louisiana
version
talk
about
conduct
as
a
business
any
game
contest
lottery
or
contrivance
when
you
put
game
and
lottery
next
to
contest
it
I
think
imply
a
certain
meaning
and
treat
that
as
include
election
be
really
a
stretch
I
think
we
would
we
do
dispute
that
you
can
refer
to
an
election
as
a
contest
just
like
you
can
refer
to
a
corporate
board
fight
as
a
contest
you
could
refer
to
a
lawsuit
as
a
contest
but
in
the
context
of
these
gambling
statute
that
not
what
they
be
talk
about
and
then
the
final
point
on
this
be
I
think
it
just
lead
to
some
really
arbitrary
result
because
if
you
focus
on
gaming
as
involve
a
game
then
there
a
certain
sense
to
it
right
as
I
say
early
like
game
do
have
any
external
economic
significance
generally
speak
so
as
a
category
it
make
sense
for
congress
the
carve
that
out
if
you
treat
it
as
game
plus
election
it
very
strange
because
it
mean
you
could
have
event
contract
on
the
weather
on
whether
somebody
go
to
be
nominate
for
a
cabinet
role
on
what
color
dress
taylor
swift
be
go
to
wear
next
week
any
of
those
be
fine
but
election
would
be
sweep
up
by
the
gaming
category
it
just
weird
because
even
if
you
think
look
election
be
different
and
should
be
treat
differently
and
I
know
my
colleague
be
go
to
try
to
explain
why
that
misguide
but
even
if
you
accept
that
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
game
so
I
think
the
sort
of
takeaway
be
the
commission
be
latch
onto
this
word
as
sort
of
a
convenient
way
to
squeeze
its
desire
policy
outcome
into
the
statute
but
it
not
a
serious
attempt
to
really
understand
what
congress
mean
by
this
term
in
this
context
the
court
when
you
say
and
I
would
agree
that
a
game
do
have
any
external
economic
significance
how
do
that
how
be
that
relevant
for
the
specific
argument
you
make
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
that
mr
roth
what
I
mean
be
if
we
try
to
think
of
what
be
congress
try
to
get
at
with
game
the
court
okay
mr
roth
if
we
understand
gaming
to
mean
a
contract
that
involve
an
underlie
game
then
there
a
certain
policy
sense
to
treat
that
category
differently
because
congress
could
have
be
think
about
it
and
say
well
there
be
some
of
this
in
the
legislative
history
the
colloquy
if
you
look
at
it
well
game
do
matter
in
the
real
word
they
game
so
we
do
want
people
essentially
gamble
right
on
something
that
do
matter
in
a
cftc
regulate
exchange
so
it
give
some
sense
to
the
categorization
that
congress
lay
out
and
the
problem
I
have
with
the
alternative
interpretation
be
they
do
have
that
sort
of
unify
policy
rationale
behind
they
right
again
the
really
broad
version
sweep
up
everything
that
do
work
and
then
game
plus
election
what
be
tie
those
thing
together
it
not
it
do
seem
to
I
a
line
that
you
could
really
seriously
draw
from
this
word
so
that
what
I
try
to
get
at
the
court
okay
mr
roth
okay
so
that
take
care
of
roman
v
and
so
our
position
be
that
be
then
the
end
of
the
analysis
and
there
no
need
to
go
any
far
but
I
will
turn
it
over
to
my
colleague
if
your
honor
have
no
further
question
on
this
piece
to
address
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
issue
the
court
there
be
a
lot
of
reference
by
the
commission
about
kind
of
representation
on
your
client
website
about
what
it
do
do
you
want
to
respond
to
that
mr
roth
I
think
it
a
page
that
just
pull
press
article
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
it
just
like
a
collection
of
link
to
article
that
have
mention
kalshi
it
not
like
a
representation
by
the
client
about
what
the
court
what
its
business
be
mr
roth
it
like
here
people
be
talk
about
we
here
a
list
of
story
the
court
okay
mr
roth
thank
you
your
honor
ms
rice
good
morning
your
honor
my
name
be
amanda
rice
and
I
here
to
talk
briefly
about
the
commission
public
interest
analysis
as
my
colleague
explain
we
think
the
statutory
issue
be
dispositive
so
you
do
have
to
go
this
far
so
I
try
to
keep
it
pretty
quick
but
even
if
you
disagree
with
we
on
the
statutory
argument
they
be
still
require
here
because
the
agency
public
policy
analysis
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
I
start
with
just
a
brief
note
on
the
standard
of
review
there
be
some
back
and
forth
on
this
issue
in
the
brief
but
as
I
think
the
commission
acknowledge
in
the
end
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
apply
to
all
final
agency
action
regardless
of
their
form
that
a
deferential
standard
for
sure
but
it
have
some
real
tooth
it
mean
agency
have
to
engage
in
reason
decision
making
and
agency
action
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
if
they
apply
the
wrong
standard
or
ignore
relevant
consideration
or
they
do
explain
themselves
reasonably
those
be
the
kind
of
argument
we
make
here
and
they
go
to
both
side
of
the
public
interest
analysis
the
sort
of
benefit
on
the
one
hand
and
the
alleged
harm
on
the
other
so
I
take
those
two
point
in
turn
start
with
the
benefit
court
reporter
clarification
ms
rice
I
be
try
to
be
quick
but
do
want
to
speak
too
quick
the
court
take
your
time
ms
rice
so
the
economic
benefit
all
follow
I
think
from
one
simple
proposition
which
be
that
partisan
control
of
congress
have
economic
implication
I
think
that
pretty
commonsensical
but
there
a
ton
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
point
I
just
get
a
couple
of
point
highlight
on
the
slide
here
the
first
one
be
from
harvard
professor
jason
furman
who
a
former
chairman
of
president
obama
council
of
economic
advisor
he
explain
that
congressional
control
impact
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
way
that
have
direct
economic
consequence
to
business
and
worker
he
say
this
risk
be
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
risk
that
can
be
manage
use
financial
market
on
the
next
slide
we
get
manage
director
of
jpmorgan
so
come
from
a
different
perspective
who
explain
that
election
risk
be
one
of
the
large
risk
that
their
client
face
that
the
frequently
engage
proactively
on
how
to
minimize
it
or
to
hedge
it
hedge
be
a
word
as
I
understand
it
for
minimize
risk
lisboa
give
the
example
of
specifically
the
coal
industry
but
there
be
a
lot
of
other
example
in
the
record
that
stand
out
on
different
side
so
there
a
software
company
serve
green
energy
business
it
at
page
1597
of
the
record
there
a
recycling
robotic
firm
that
at
1533
of
the
record
these
be
just
sort
of
common
sense
example
of
business
that
have
direct
control
of
partisan
control
of
congress
and
then
take
it
from
sam
altman
who
the
ceo
of
openai
he
explain
here
the
different
risk
that
biotech
company
face
those
be
direct
and
they
predictable
he
explain
they
involve
everything
from
the
fda
and
different
approval
to
research
funding
and
legislation
so
it
not
just
legislation
there
all
kind
of
other
thing
that
congress
be
do
here
because
these
risk
be
so
significant
financial
institution
already
offer
projection
on
the
economic
impact
of
election
and
there
instrument
for
hedge
against
those
risk
you
already
see
it
from
jpmorgan
there
more
example
of
that
on
page
42
to
44
of
the
record
if
that
helpful
and
then
there
be
the
noneconomic
benefit
researcher
policymaker
the
public
everyone
benefit
from
market
base
datum
about
election
these
market
already
exist
I
know
your
honor
be
familiar
with
in
nonprofit
form
because
this
information
be
so
valuable
so
these
be
just
a
few
example
from
the
record
but
that
really
just
tip
of
the
iceberg
I
think
page
40
and
41
of
our
opening
brief
and
68
to
70
of
the
record
really
tell
this
story
of
the
noneconomic
benefit
so
the
agency
do
have
much
to
say
about
either
of
those
two
point
so
they
respond
mostly
by
try
to
move
the
goal
post
they
make
what
I
understand
to
be
two
primary
argument
the
first
one
be
about
direct
effect
they
say
that
the
economic
effect
of
election
sure
that
they
exist
but
they
not
direct
enough
I
think
your
honor
be
use
the
language
of
too
many
intervene
event
to
make
a
difference
we
explain
in
our
brief
that
the
record
say
otherwise
you
already
see
some
example
today
I
think
more
important
and
more
fundamental
be
the
idea
that
the
whole
point
of
having
hedge
with
event
contract
be
to
account
for
diffused
risk
this
be
not
a
one
to
one
kind
of
hedge
product
like
the
way
insurance
work
if
there
a
hurricane
for
example
that
example
help
I
because
you
can
see
both
the
direct
and
indirect
effect
of
a
hurricane
right
it
might
destroy
property
but
it
do
other
stuff
too
it
deter
tourist
you
can
always
predict
exactly
what
those
effect
might
be
but
it
a
feature
not
a
bug
of
these
contract
they
allow
you
to
capture
anything
that
might
follow
from
an
event
like
this
the
court
if
I
can
just
stop
you
right
there
so
what
I
understand
the
argument
on
the
other
side
to
be
be
certainly
if
a
hurricane
hit
the
extent
of
the
damage
or
effect
on
tourism
or
property
that
might
not
be
able
to
be
predict
in
advance
so
whatever
your
bad
fear
might
not
materialize
but
whatever
effect
there
be
will
be
direct
meaning
to
the
extent
that
there
be
property
damage
you
can
trace
that
directly
to
the
hurricane
so
maybe
the
result
do
materialize
in
the
way
that
it
be
predict
but
there
be
a
direct
effect
and
my
understanding
be
that
at
least
they
would
argue
with
election
particularly
in
this
context
where
we
talk
about
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
by
a
party
that
sure
whatever
think
about
what
might
happen
may
not
materialize
but
to
the
extent
there
be
an
effect
you
may
not
be
able
to
trace
it
directly
to
who
control
a
party
at
a
give
time
or
a
chamber
of
congress
at
a
different
time
because
there
be
so
many
variable
who
in
office
as
president
kind
of
what
the
split
be
if
it
a
more
even
split
kind
of
what
the
priority
be
of
congress
despite
control
legislation
do
always
get
pass
or
become
a
priority
so
what
would
you
respond
to
their
point
about
this
not
be
the
kind
of
direct
economic
effect
that
some
of
the
other
trading
contract
have
ms
rice
I
think
you
right
about
what
their
argument
be
but
I
think
both
piece
of
it
be
wrong
and
start
with
the
hurricane
example
I
think
hurricane
do
have
very
similar
indirect
effect
so
you
talk
about
property
damage
but
that
not
it
there
might
also
be
decrease
in
tourism
that
might
also
have
to
do
with
other
feature
of
the
weather
do
an
amusement
park
get
build
nearby
thing
like
that
might
also
affect
tourism
it
not
go
to
be
one
to
one
there
actually
a
pretty
helpful
chart
on
page
53
to
55
of
the
record
that
identify
some
other
event
contract
and
try
to
explain
exactly
that
point
here
be
the
way
in
which
the
economic
impact
be
not
direct
they
indirect
and
that
true
of
temperature
fluctuation
so
be
it
go
to
be
hot
in
california
this
month
that
might
have
some
direct
effect
and
then
some
indirect
effect
that
the
first
piece
of
it
the
way
other
contract
work
the
way
congress
work
there
also
a
lot
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
be
direct
effect
here
that
just
the
election
a
change
of
control
in
congress
affect
stock
price
immediately
affect
the
valuation
of
entity
immediately
without
any
legislation
pass
that
legislation
pass
be
of
course
a
piece
of
this
but
these
economic
impact
happen
even
if
no
legislation
pass
so
I
think
the
discussion
at
40
to
46
of
the
record
be
pretty
helpful
on
that
it
have
some
example
I
point
to
1397
which
show
that
the
green
energy
sector
surge
as
a
result
of
the
democratic
party
senate
takeover
again
before
anything
happen
it
just
control
of
congress
that
have
these
direct
effect
so
to
circle
back
to
your
question
I
think
direct
effect
be
a
strange
question
to
be
ask
for
these
contract
but
not
other
when
all
event
contract
have
these
sort
of
indirect
economic
effect
but
even
if
that
be
the
question
I
think
it
pretty
clear
that
there
be
direct
effect
here
if
that
answer
your
question
the
court
maybe
you
about
to
get
to
this
I
do
want
to
distract
you
from
your
presentation
but
can
you
speak
to
the
manipulation
and
integrity
piece
because
I
do
think
and
obviously
I
go
to
look
very
closely
at
the
statute
and
follow
what
it
say
but
I
do
think
there
be
kind
of
a
just
to
be
honest
a
gut
reaction
that
people
might
have
that
wow
bet
on
election
do
seem
like
a
good
idea
it
seem
like
there
a
lot
of
room
for
manipulation
for
kind
of
unsavory
thing
happen
can
you
speak
to
that
directly
and
what
your
position
be
as
it
relate
to
the
public
interest
concern
because
I
understand
a
significant
part
of
the
commission
view
that
this
be
against
public
interest
have
to
do
with
some
of
those
concern
ms
rice
absolutely
I
skip
right
there
I
think
you
right
that
that
what
the
commission
say
that
it
sort
of
feel
icky
or
that
there
a
risk
of
election
manipulation
in
some
form
and
I
think
start
with
the
risk
of
manipulation
which
I
think
be
the
more
serious
public
interest
analysis
the
icky
feeling
I
think
be
misguide
but
I
think
it
stem
from
the
misunderstanding
that
these
contract
could
influence
election
in
some
way
or
people
will
be
buy
vote
or
thing
like
that
so
I
guess
I
start
by
point
out
that
political
event
market
have
exist
forever
in
unregulated
form
but
also
in
other
democracy
and
I
do
think
there
a
feeling
in
those
place
that
somehow
the
existence
of
these
market
affect
the
integrity
of
election
then
there
good
research
in
the
record
show
that
this
kind
of
manipulation
be
not
remotely
plausible
I
find
the
comment
from
the
center
for
effective
altruism
particularly
helpful
at
this
point
that
at
page
1427
to
1436
of
the
record
kind
of
take
each
aspect
of
the
election
manipulation
argument
and
unpack
they
one
at
a
time
and
explain
why
they
wrong
at
that
time
most
basic
level
I
think
the
key
point
be
that
people
try
to
influence
election
because
they
matter
they
matter
for
our
life
they
matter
for
their
economic
effect
but
for
lot
of
other
reason
and
so
there
lot
of
money
and
effort
spend
on
influence
election
that
what
campaign
finance
fight
be
all
about
and
there
a
way
in
which
you
might
think
that
some
of
that
icky
or
you
have
the
same
reaction
that
spend
money
to
try
to
get
election
be
icky
but
I
think
it
important
here
to
point
out
how
much
money
and
how
many
incentive
there
be
in
these
election
because
it
make
manipulation
seem
pretty
darn
unlikely
particularly
as
your
honor
point
out
at
the
beginning
that
this
be
a
contract
about
control
of
congress
I
think
this
be
another
place
where
that
point
be
relevant
so
it
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
statutory
analysis
but
on
the
public
interest
piece
if
you
ask
what
the
public
interest
here
we
look
at
this
specific
contract
and
ask
whether
there
a
serious
public
interest
harm
on
the
other
side
if
there
some
possibility
that
have
a
regulated
event
contract
market
as
oppose
to
the
unregulated
one
that
already
exist
could
result
in
manipulation
of
control
of
congress
it
just
pretty
hard
to
imagine
I
think
if
there
be
a
way
to
manipulate
control
of
congress
someone
would
have
try
it
hard
to
imagine
that
the
event
contract
market
could
change
all
of
the
profound
incentive
that
already
exist
it
sort
of
circle
back
to
the
initial
point
that
election
matter
they
have
real
life
consequence
and
that
why
people
try
to
impact
election
I
think
the
record
be
pretty
clear
that
the
possibility
of
manipulation
be
just
pure
speculation
that
there
not
evidence
support
that
sort
of
intuition
that
you
come
up
with
at
the
beginning
that
there
something
that
feel
a
little
bit
strange
about
that
one
last
point
I
think
the
commission
suggest
too
it
would
have
to
police
election
if
it
approve
these
contract
my
response
to
that
be
just
the
agency
regulate
contract
that
have
underlie
event
of
all
kind
so
an
event
contract
on
power
plant
emission
do
mean
the
cftc
have
to
become
the
epa
all
of
a
sudden
and
regulate
power
plant
emission
in
the
same
way
that
an
event
contract
that
have
to
do
with
stock
price
do
turn
it
into
the
scc
all
the
agency
do
be
the
same
thing
it
do
in
any
other
context
it
just
regulate
the
market
not
the
underlie
activity
so
insomuch
as
that
the
other
aspect
of
this
that
there
a
concern
about
manipulation
and
there
a
concern
about
the
agency
and
what
it
would
have
to
do
as
a
result
I
think
there
no
real
reason
to
worry
that
its
role
would
be
any
different
here
than
it
be
in
any
other
context
the
court
do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
what
your
colleague
be
say
when
I
ask
the
question
about
the
particular
safeguard
that
your
client
have
put
into
place
and
obviously
deem
important
for
example
the
one
that
stick
out
be
well
if
you
a
pay
member
of
a
congressional
staff
then
you
obviously
can
not
trade
these
contract
and
there
be
other
safeguard
that
be
put
into
place
but
as
I
understand
your
position
the
commission
would
reach
that
because
it
not
enumerate
in
the
statute
so
there
would
be
no
public
interest
inquiry
and
so
those
kind
of
condition
or
safeguard
would
not
be
require
nor
be
the
fact
that
this
be
an
election
contract
involve
control
of
the
house
particularly
relevant
a
dcm
could
have
this
event
contract
for
the
upcoming
presidential
election
right
so
those
thing
that
you
point
to
as
evidence
of
well
there
be
safeguard
in
place
and
this
be
about
control
of
congress
that
not
really
relevant
to
the
statutory
question
correct
ms
rice
you
right
that
it
not
part
of
the
statutory
question
it
be
relevant
to
the
public
interest
analysis
if
you
get
that
far
if
you
assume
that
we
lose
on
the
statutory
analysis
which
we
do
think
be
the
right
answer
here
but
if
you
get
to
public
interest
so
this
be
a
gaming
contract
or
unlawful
activity
contract
then
you
look
at
the
public
interest
and
it
be
relevant
the
kind
of
safeguard
we
have
in
place
and
the
fact
that
this
be
a
contract
involve
the
court
I
guess
that
my
point
if
under
your
reading
you
would
get
to
the
public
interest
so
that
my
point
the
commission
would
have
no
ability
or
interest
in
consider
the
fact
that
a
contract
do
have
such
a
safeguard
mr
roth
I
do
want
to
cut
you
off
but
I
have
to
ask
my
colleague
who
actually
know
the
statutory
framework
well
the
court
okay
mr
roth
what
he
clarify
for
I
be
that
there
be
separate
antifraud
provision
anti
manipulation
provision
and
what
they
call
the
core
principle
that
you
have
to
comply
with
and
so
that
where
some
of
these
other
safeguard
come
from
it
just
not
from
this
particular
statute
sorry
I
do
mean
to
rice
no
no
no
the
court
let
I
just
make
sure
I
understand
you
say
it
not
implicate
by
this
statutory
provision
that
at
issue
in
the
lawsuit
but
as
part
of
this
scheme
generally
there
other
safeguard
and
these
be
statutory
from
the
commission
mean
that
you
have
to
comply
with
these
provision
mr
roth
right
that
right
the
court
okay
ms
rice
that
all
consistent
with
my
understanding
and
there
some
stuff
in
the
record
on
this
too
page
80
to
88
of
the
ja
and
99
to
100
we
talk
about
the
core
principle
and
the
kind
of
background
rule
in
place
just
to
be
a
regulated
market
that
this
cftc
regulate
you
have
to
have
these
protection
you
list
out
the
specific
people
that
be
allow
to
trade
and
all
of
that
be
exactly
right
but
there
be
separately
and
for
all
contract
a
prohibition
on
any
insider
with
any
non
public
information
trading
on
these
contract
so
that
in
addition
to
the
specifically
enumerate
category
the
court
that
make
sense
and
that
apply
to
any
of
these
event
contract
ms
rice
exactly
to
everything
so
where
there
be
insider
trading
or
manipulation
the
agency
have
the
tool
to
go
out
and
investigate
those
thing
they
just
not
relevant
to
the
statutory
analysis
in
the
first
instance
if
that
make
sense
unless
you
have
anything
far
your
honor
I
just
wrap
up
by
reiterate
that
I
do
think
you
need
to
get
to
public
interest
but
if
you
do
you
still
should
vacate
the
order
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
court
I
do
have
another
question
I
do
know
whose
so
I
will
let
whoever
answer
this
there
be
something
in
the
commission
brief
that
I
think
be
it
this
point
unlike
many
hedging
and
risk
management
contract
the
payout
on
the
contract
at
issue
here
be
not
in
any
way
tie
to
actual
or
estimate
loss
incur
elsewhere
and
a
loss
on
the
contract
be
not
offset
by
a
gain
elsewhere
I
just
think
that
be
interesting
and
want
your
response
to
that
ms
rice
I
do
think
that
as
unusual
as
the
commission
make
out
the
example
that
come
to
mind
immediately
be
the
temperature
relate
contract
I
think
that
work
in
the
same
way
that
that
not
a
gain
or
a
loss
necessarily
it
not
clear
even
which
way
that
cut
there
may
well
be
other
example
but
my
immediate
reaction
to
that
be
I
do
think
that
particularly
unusual
in
this
context
the
court
I
learn
more
about
this
market
through
this
case
but
this
whole
future
market
it
seem
to
I
it
grow
beyond
the
day
in
which
only
those
who
be
interested
in
the
commodity
or
directly
affect
be
participate
I
mean
that
the
case
for
all
these
contract
right
ms
rice
that
true
of
all
the
contract
in
fact
instrument
to
make
money
be
actually
necessary
for
the
market
I
think
as
the
commission
order
I
think
acknowledge
some
amount
of
speculation
or
people
who
be
invest
in
these
to
be
liquid
because
if
it
be
just
hedger
if
it
be
100
percent
hedger
you
do
actually
get
someone
willing
to
balance
out
the
price
and
sell
you
or
buy
from
you
at
the
other
side
so
there
be
people
in
all
of
these
market
who
do
have
a
direct
hedging
interest
but
the
hedge
piece
of
it
be
certainly
meaningful
and
potentially
more
meaningful
in
this
context
than
many
of
the
other
the
court
be
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say
about
their
economic
purpose
test
I
try
to
see
what
the
daylight
between
the
two
party
be
with
respect
to
that
test
and
how
it
apply
ms
rice
so
I
think
we
agree
that
the
commission
have
discretion
to
consider
the
economic
impact
of
these
contract
that
this
statue
and
these
instrument
be
about
economic
benefit
I
think
where
we
diverge
be
the
commission
focus
on
sort
of
two
thing
one
be
direct
effect
as
oppose
to
indirect
effect
we
talk
about
and
the
other
be
this
predominately
hedge
or
more
than
occasional
hedge
the
court
that
what
I
mean
ms
rice
the
language
shift
in
the
order
and
I
think
the
difference
probably
matter
occasional
sound
to
I
like
something
less
than
predominant
I
not
entirely
clear
which
one
the
commission
be
advocate
for
so
I
think
part
of
the
problem
with
that
standard
be
that
it
not
clear
what
it
mean
whether
it
mean
a
certain
number
of
us
how
many
dollar
be
go
to
be
spend
in
a
hedging
way
be
it
a
proportion
of
us
be
it
some
combination
of
the
two
and
how
much
be
occasional
I
do
know
that
you
need
to
get
into
that
your
honor
because
I
think
by
any
metric
the
record
show
there
will
be
more
than
occasional
us
here
but
I
think
those
be
the
two
point
on
which
we
really
disagree
not
on
whether
economic
benefit
be
relevant
the
court
the
same
question
I
do
really
understand
there
to
be
a
dispute
about
my
standard
of
review
here
and
what
the
applicable
review
framework
be
ms
rice
I
agree
with
that
your
honor
there
be
some
back
and
forth
about
rule
make
case
versus
adjudication
case
ultimately
the
standard
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
both
there
be
more
rule
make
case
and
this
proceeding
be
a
bit
unusual
in
that
there
be
formal
comment
accept
and
consider
which
do
turn
it
into
a
formal
rule
make
that
never
be
our
argument
but
it
look
a
little
bit
more
formal
than
informal
adjudication
do
but
you
right
that
the
standard
be
the
same
the
court
all
right
thank
you
ms
stuke
good
afternoon
your
honor
to
reintroduce
myself
I
ann
stuke
on
behalf
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
as
we
do
in
our
brief
I
go
to
refer
to
my
agency
today
as
the
cftc
or
the
commission
and
I
refer
to
the
plaintiff
simply
as
kalshi
I
have
about
an
hour
worth
of
remark
for
your
honor
today
if
that
be
okay
with
you
the
court
we
may
take
just
a
court
reporter
break
at
some
point
so
I
let
you
get
start
ms
stuke
thank
you
any
time
you
want
I
to
jump
to
an
issue
please
just
let
I
know
the
court
could
I
just
ask
you
something
I
curious
about
to
start
ms
stuke
absolutely
sure
the
court
with
respect
to
this
catchall
category
the
commission
specifically
do
make
an
argument
that
this
contract
fall
within
the
catchall
and
I
be
just
curious
as
to
I
not
say
it
do
I
just
curious
as
to
why
that
be
the
position
of
the
commission
ms
stuke
in
consider
the
case
that
be
before
it
the
commission
examine
these
contract
and
determine
that
two
category
apply
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
statute
and
therefore
do
reach
any
further
category
the
court
okay
ms
stuke
so
as
the
court
be
aware
the
cftc
order
that
at
issue
in
this
case
determine
under
cea
section
5cc5c
I
call
it
5cc5c
I
talk
about
the
same
statutory
language
that
codify
at
7
78
2
the
cea
be
like
many
statute
sort
of
odd
where
sometimes
our
statutory
section
do
line
up
with
the
codification
in
any
event
the
order
at
issue
here
determined
under
cea
5cc5c
that
kalshi
propose
congressional
control
contract
should
not
be
offer
on
kalshi
platform
because
the
commission
determine
that
those
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
commission
decision
be
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
commission
decision
address
four
principle
issue
that
the
party
have
brief
and
I
will
discuss
today
first
how
do
the
word
involve
apply
to
activity
enumerate
in
the
statute
second
do
these
propose
contract
involve
the
enumerate
activity
of
gaming
third
do
the
contract
involve
the
enumerate
activity
of
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
and
four
be
the
contract
contrary
to
public
interest
before
I
get
into
the
substance
of
each
of
these
issue
I
want
to
emphasize
that
the
commission
order
be
an
informal
adjudication
and
your
honor
just
ask
about
the
standard
of
review
this
be
not
a
rule
making
and
it
not
even
a
formal
adjudication
and
that
mean
in
practical
term
that
the
commission
be
decide
just
one
issue
whether
these
particular
propose
contract
should
be
list
on
kalshi
event
contract
platform
and
the
commission
do
purport
to
address
any
other
question
large
than
that
so
for
instance
the
order
do
establish
the
full
mete
and
bound
of
how
the
statute
might
apply
to
any
other
event
contract
other
than
the
one
that
be
before
it
the
court
and
just
for
my
own
information
be
it
typical
for
the
commission
to
solicit
comment
in
a
circumstance
like
this
ms
stuke
it
not
require
it
do
so
I
think
in
an
abundance
of
caution
the
court
be
that
an
unusual
event
or
not
unusual
ms
stuke
I
do
want
to
say
something
misleading
especially
without
talk
to
my
colleague
about
how
frequently
have
we
do
this
I
wish
I
have
a
well
answer
for
your
honor
the
court
it
more
out
of
my
curiosity
ms
stuke
I
can
see
why
I
think
the
commission
do
it
really
in
an
abundance
of
caution
because
of
public
interest
associate
with
this
topic
generally
the
court
okay
ms
stuke
I
emphasize
that
this
be
an
informal
adjudication
because
when
your
honor
consider
the
question
before
you
which
be
rather
the
commission
run
afoul
of
what
require
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
standard
of
review
be
a
lenient
one
the
law
require
only
that
the
agency
act
within
a
zone
of
reasonableness
here
the
cftc
reasonably
consider
the
relevant
issue
and
reasonably
explain
its
position
and
no
more
be
require
under
the
apa
the
apa
give
the
agency
deference
on
its
predictive
judgment
and
on
its
public
interest
determination
now
there
be
question
of
statutory
interpretation
in
this
case
and
your
honor
find
herself
maybe
in
the
unenviable
position
of
have
each
party
in
this
case
tell
you
the
statute
be
unambiguous
that
the
plain
meaning
advocate
by
each
side
support
each
side
I
submit
that
the
commission
have
the
well
of
the
argument
on
what
the
statute
mean
and
how
it
apply
on
involve
gaming
and
unlawful
under
state
law
that
the
court
review
on
the
statutory
interpretation
question
be
de
novo
I
get
into
now
the
first
of
the
four
issue
that
be
before
the
court
that
be
brief
in
the
party
paper
and
that
be
the
commission
reading
of
the
word
involve
to
have
its
ordinary
meaning
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
as
an
essential
feature
a
consequence
these
be
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
of
the
term
and
that
be
the
definition
that
apply
because
the
term
involve
be
the
the
term
involve
be
not
define
in
the
statute
and
so
case
law
have
hold
for
a
long
time
that
when
there
when
the
statute
do
define
the
term
its
ordinary
meaning
apply
and
that
mean
the
ordinary
meaning
in
dictionary
so
what
that
mean
for
the
statute
here
be
that
the
plain
meaning
of
involve
when
we
talk
about
the
category
enumerate
in
the
statute
that
would
render
an
event
contract
eligible
for
public
interest
review
the
word
involve
be
broad
enough
by
its
plain
meaning
to
cover
event
contract
whose
underlying
meaning
the
event
on
which
the
contract
be
premise
here
the
outcome
of
congressional
election
the
statute
be
broad
enough
to
cover
contract
where
whose
underlying
involve
the
enumerate
activity
as
well
as
contract
that
relate
closely
entail
or
have
as
their
essentially
feature
or
consequence
the
enumerate
activity
the
court
I
do
understand
the
plaintiff
to
necessarily
disagree
with
the
definition
that
you
set
forward
but
I
think
when
you
say
that
closely
relate
to
or
entail
they
say
yes
to
the
subject
matter
or
underlying
activity
of
the
contract
so
can
you
just
speak
to
that
because
I
have
think
initially
that
there
be
some
difference
with
how
you
be
define
involve
and
now
having
hear
from
plaintiff
and
go
back
and
read
their
brief
review
those
portion
of
the
brief
I
now
see
more
clearly
what
they
be
say
that
those
definition
have
to
relate
to
the
activity
at
issue
underlie
the
contract
so
if
you
could
just
speak
directly
to
that
ms
stuke
that
be
generally
my
understanding
of
the
dispute
between
the
party
here
and
that
be
as
I
understand
the
plaintiff
and
not
to
mischaracterize
but
as
I
understand
the
plaintiff
position
they
say
involve
if
it
mean
anything
it
have
to
mean
that
the
underlie
event
involve
an
enumerate
activity
and
it
can
be
a
broad
relationship
involve
the
contract
itself
so
when
we
look
at
the
statutory
language
and
whether
a
contract
be
in
the
scope
of
the
pardon
I
of
the
statute
at
all
it
a
two
step
inquiry
so
the
first
step
in
the
statutory
language
be
do
the
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
an
exclude
commodity
that
be
base
upon
base
upon
that
mean
the
underlie
base
upon
the
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
so
step
one
in
other
word
ask
be
the
contract
base
on
do
it
be
it
base
on
be
the
underlie
an
event
because
this
pardon
I
this
statute
apply
only
to
event
contract
so
step
one
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
which
use
base
upon
mean
underlie
in
the
same
sentence
that
it
use
involve
step
one
be
be
this
an
event
contract
at
all
be
the
underlie
an
event
if
so
we
in
the
statute
at
least
this
far
step
two
be
whether
the
agreement
contract
or
transaction
involve
the
enumerate
activity
and
that
a
broad
question
than
whether
just
the
underlying
event
involve
the
enumerate
activity
base
on
as
use
in
the
statute
unambiguously
refer
to
the
underlying
event
it
must
be
an
event
that
all
involve
be
broad
any
aspect
of
the
contract
transaction
or
agreement
if
it
involve
an
enumerate
activity
we
submit
that
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
involve
it
in
the
statute
at
least
it
get
you
so
far
as
to
be
eligible
that
the
relationship
between
the
contract
and
the
enumerate
activity
if
the
contract
transaction
or
agreement
involve
the
enumerate
activity
we
in
the
statute
underlie
what
the
contract
be
base
upon
what
the
actual
event
be
can
be
can
the
underlying
can
involve
the
enumerate
activity
they
fairly
easy
to
think
of
example
if
the
event
contract
be
base
upon
whether
a
war
will
break
out
it
in
an
enumerate
activity
the
court
be
there
an
example
of
a
contract
that
under
this
broad
definition
that
you
advocate
for
would
involve
war
where
the
underlie
activity
in
the
contract
do
speak
to
war
itself
ms
stuke
the
example
be
the
example
of
how
a
contract
could
involve
war
but
not
involve
an
act
of
war
have
to
do
and
I
think
both
party
cite
this
kind
of
example
will
I
hate
to
give
these
real
world
example
will
a
foreign
body
be
able
to
use
weapon
on
its
enemy
soil
something
like
that
that
involve
oh
gosh
I
do
want
to
get
too
in
the
weed
will
funding
be
allocate
to
a
country
that
at
war
that
involve
war
the
court
I
think
they
would
say
yes
ms
stuke
I
actually
do
think
we
too
off
base
on
that
I
think
the
real
dispute
between
the
party
be
what
be
you
look
at
what
have
to
involve
the
enumerate
activity
and
the
real
rub
here
be
that
the
commission
interpret
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
to
say
if
transact
in
the
contract
if
the
feature
or
purpose
of
these
contract
be
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
gambling
be
the
one
gaming
pardon
I
be
the
one
that
come
to
mind
be
transact
in
the
contract
be
that
essential
feature
gaming
and
the
commission
here
say
yes
for
gaming
and
for
unlawful
under
state
law
the
court
so
what
be
your
good
argument
for
their
response
that
there
be
a
lot
of
state
and
they
list
they
for
I
that
make
any
type
of
bet
stake
on
any
contingent
event
unlawful
under
state
law
such
that
that
what
these
event
contract
be
so
every
event
contract
should
theoretically
if
the
transaction
of
the
contract
in
and
of
itself
be
what
involve
mean
and
not
the
underlie
activity
at
issue
in
the
contract
than
just
the
mere
transacting
event
contract
would
violate
state
law
how
do
you
respond
to
that
ms
stuke
I
want
to
say
two
thing
about
that
and
I
can
jump
to
the
discussion
of
how
we
analyze
unlawful
under
state
law
the
commission
be
not
say
that
involve
in
every
instance
mean
anything
other
than
its
plain
meaning
let
I
say
that
in
a
little
more
with
a
little
well
articulation
involve
be
a
broad
term
it
broad
enough
to
cover
event
contract
whose
underlie
be
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
and
it
broad
enough
to
cover
an
event
contract
whose
essential
feature
be
one
of
the
enumerate
activity
and
here
an
essential
feature
of
these
contract
be
bet
or
wager
on
election
the
court
but
an
essential
feature
of
some
other
contract
could
be
bet
or
wager
on
fill
in
the
blank
ms
stuke
right
so
your
honor
concern
I
think
be
the
plaintiff
argument
what
do
we
do
with
this
what
I
interpret
as
an
extrapolation
from
what
the
commission
actually
say
to
say
well
that
would
be
absurd
in
another
context
because
other
state
law
say
it
unlawful
there
be
state
law
that
say
it
unlawful
to
wager
on
any
contingent
event
and
that
would
sweep
in
every
event
contract
to
a
public
interest
review
the
court
right
ms
stuke
so
I
just
get
to
my
note
where
I
have
this
the
court
sure
take
your
time
ms
stuke
the
commission
have
before
it
the
question
of
whether
these
contract
which
involve
wager
on
election
involve
activity
under
state
law
here
we
have
numerous
state
law
that
forbid
wagering
on
election
and
that
be
sufficient
for
the
commission
to
say
state
law
forbid
wager
on
election
that
the
essential
feature
of
these
contract
and
we
can
stop
there
what
the
commission
do
do
be
say
state
law
forbid
or
make
unlawful
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
that
be
not
the
basis
of
the
commission
reasoning
and
even
if
you
can
say
if
a
be
to
b
then
c
be
to
d
like
some
logical
extrapolation
that
not
what
the
commission
do
here
it
just
say
we
see
under
state
law
that
wager
on
election
be
unlawful
and
that
the
essential
feature
of
these
contract
and
that
enough
that
enough
that
we
in
the
zone
of
the
statute
the
court
right
but
ms
stuke
and
it
not
unreasonable
I
sorry
I
interrupt
your
honor
the
court
I
just
want
to
because
right
now
I
think
we
talk
about
what
the
meaning
of
the
term
in
the
statute
be
and
their
argument
as
I
understand
it
be
that
the
commission
reading
do
make
sense
this
be
otherwise
unambiguous
and
they
apply
this
word
in
a
way
that
kind
of
mean
one
thing
in
one
subsection
and
another
in
another
subsection
and
what
they
say
be
election
be
not
on
this
enumerate
list
and
that
full
stop
end
of
case
and
you
say
well
no
it
fit
under
the
first
category
because
bet
on
or
wager
on
election
violate
many
state
law
and
their
response
be
wager
on
any
contingent
event
violate
many
state
law
and
if
that
be
the
reading
if
that
how
the
statute
be
read
that
would
mean
that
every
event
contract
would
be
subject
to
this
two
step
review
which
be
not
the
intent
when
the
statute
be
amend
to
streamline
this
process
and
not
make
the
dcm
have
to
make
an
initial
showing
that
the
contract
be
in
the
public
interest
so
I
just
speak
more
about
the
unlawful
under
state
law
what
do
that
mean
do
that
mean
that
the
act
of
trade
the
contract
be
unlawful
under
state
law
in
which
case
that
would
might
relate
to
many
contract
or
all
event
contract
or
do
the
underlie
activity
for
example
I
think
plaintiff
give
an
example
whether
or
not
some
crime
be
go
to
occur
whatever
it
be
some
specific
criminal
activity
where
the
subject
of
the
contract
relate
to
involve
something
that
be
unlawful
so
I
just
want
to
understand
the
difference
your
response
to
that
that
your
reading
would
put
every
event
contract
under
this
inquiry
ms
stuke
respectfully
I
do
believe
that
what
the
commission
hold
in
this
order
would
subject
every
event
contract
because
what
the
commission
say
be
only
that
examine
these
contract
whose
essential
feature
be
to
bet
on
election
that
involve
activity
that
many
state
law
prohibit
what
the
commission
do
not
say
be
these
contract
involve
wager
on
a
contingent
event
and
many
state
law
make
wager
on
a
contingent
event
unlawful
therefore
it
be
the
court
hypothetically
let
say
I
a
plaintiff
I
a
dcm
I
want
to
post
my
event
contract
about
whether
or
not
a
hurricane
will
hit
in
florida
and
the
commission
come
back
and
say
this
be
against
public
interest
and
it
also
fall
under
I
do
this
out
of
order
it
fall
under
category
one
because
in
florida
and
elsewhere
the
state
law
prohibit
people
from
post
or
make
bet
or
wager
on
contingent
event
and
a
hurricane
be
a
contingent
event
and
this
contract
involve
a
wager
on
a
contingent
event
so
we
not
go
to
allow
it
would
that
be
allow
under
this
statute
would
that
work
ms
stuke
I
think
it
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
the
statute
the
court
and
why
ms
stuke
and
it
because
this
statute
set
forth
in
broad
term
the
category
that
be
the
subject
of
public
interest
review
and
none
of
those
category
on
their
face
suggest
that
congress
intend
to
capture
all
event
contract
and
it
the
court
right
that
their
point
I
think
that
exactly
what
they
say
ms
stuke
I
think
actually
the
party
agree
I
think
where
we
off
be
the
commission
do
agree
that
that
what
it
conclude
in
this
case
it
conclude
that
state
law
forbid
wager
on
election
and
that
an
important
state
interest
that
kalshi
be
ask
the
commission
to
undermine
by
allow
these
contract
to
trade
on
a
federally
register
exchange
a
federally
regulate
exchange
to
be
clear
the
commission
order
do
find
that
like
if
these
contract
be
allow
it
do
find
that
purchase
one
of
kalshi
congressional
control
contract
would
be
illegal
in
jurisdiction
that
prohibit
bet
on
election
by
statute
or
common
law
kalshi
argue
that
the
commission
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
fall
afoul
of
the
law
because
it
can
be
illegal
under
state
law
to
offer
the
contract
on
a
market
regulate
by
the
cftc
because
fransha
ph
but
that
as
the
commission
hold
in
its
order
miss
the
point
the
cea
be
a
federal
statutory
regime
for
the
regulation
of
commodity
derivative
market
and
it
do
preempt
state
law
that
prohibit
the
trading
of
commodity
contract
no
state
law
can
ban
a
contract
that
lawfully
list
on
a
cftc
regulate
market
but
what
kalshi
ask
the
commission
to
do
here
and
what
kalshi
be
ask
the
court
to
do
be
to
order
the
cftc
to
permit
these
contract
when
kalshi
own
website
cite
news
article
that
characterize
they
repeatedly
as
election
gambling
bet
on
election
when
under
state
law
it
illegal
to
gamble
on
election
and
this
by
the
way
be
the
reason
we
here
if
kalshi
could
lawfully
offer
election
bet
contract
on
cftc
market
it
could
ignore
any
state
law
that
disallow
election
gambling
even
state
that
allow
gambling
prohibit
bet
on
election
and
that
indicate
that
the
concern
be
not
so
much
gambling
but
election
integrity
you
can
place
a
bet
on
an
election
in
las
vegas
or
atlantic
city
for
the
cftc
to
allow
the
contract
it
would
have
have
to
undermine
these
important
state
interest
and
so
when
the
commission
conclude
in
its
order
that
in
consider
whether
a
contract
involve
activity
under
state
law
it
consider
whether
the
activity
be
unlawful
under
state
law
that
be
not
otherwise
preempt
by
the
cftc
law
that
go
to
state
interest
that
be
not
overlap
with
the
cea
regulatory
authority
and
when
the
commission
consider
that
it
can
consider
whether
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
commodity
market
federal
commodity
derivative
market
should
be
use
to
subvert
important
state
interest
so
this
question
of
well
it
frustrating
to
I
I
an
advocate
I
should
be
frustrate
by
my
opponent
argument
but
what
frustrating
to
I
about
that
be
this
concept
that
the
commission
interpretation
of
the
statute
do
make
sense
because
some
state
law
make
it
illegal
to
place
a
wager
on
any
contingent
event
it
a
distraction
it
not
what
the
commission
hold
here
the
commission
go
as
far
as
it
need
to
go
because
this
be
an
informal
adjudication
it
one
case
under
a
different
set
of
fact
and
a
different
propose
contract
it
might
look
to
that
language
it
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
the
statute
to
say
because
many
state
law
prohibit
wager
on
any
contingent
event
that
all
event
contract
be
unlawful
it
would
be
an
usual
reading
of
a
statute
that
set
forth
only
enumerate
category
the
court
I
think
they
would
agree
with
that
ms
stuke
right
I
think
we
agree
on
that
the
court
well
I
do
think
you
want
to
agree
on
if
you
do
want
to
agree
on
that
I
think
you
want
to
distinguish
that
from
the
election
ms
stuke
no
what
I
be
say
be
the
commission
do
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
state
law
that
make
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
unlawful
the
commission
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
state
law
that
make
election
wagering
unlawful
it
do
consider
in
its
decision
and
it
do
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
these
other
broad
state
law
and
so
it
do
even
factor
in
to
the
review
here
whether
they
exist
or
not
it
be
the
basis
for
the
commission
decision
and
even
if
you
can
extrapolate
what
the
commission
be
not
do
here
the
commission
be
rule
here
it
go
only
as
far
as
it
need
to
go
to
decide
the
issue
before
it
I
hope
that
that
be
come
through
to
your
honor
so
here
because
these
contract
have
as
their
essential
feature
not
that
they
wager
on
any
contingent
event
but
they
be
wager
on
the
outcome
of
election
and
wager
on
election
be
unlawful
under
numerous
state
law
the
commission
be
reasonable
in
its
determination
that
these
contract
fit
within
that
category
of
unlawful
under
state
law
to
render
they
at
least
in
the
statute
in
subsection
I
can
move
on
to
talk
about
gaming
unless
you
want
to
talk
about
the
court
let
talk
about
game
ms
stuke
okay
again
with
the
term
game
the
commission
apply
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
game
to
conclude
that
these
contract
would
fall
within
that
enumerate
category
again
game
be
not
a
define
term
in
the
statute
and
so
what
the
commission
do
reasonably
be
look
to
its
ordinary
meaning
as
define
in
dictionary
and
in
ordinary
meaning
as
define
in
state
law
and
federal
law
well
I
talk
about
that
in
a
second
and
conclude
that
it
fall
within
the
ordinary
that
those
propose
contract
which
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
election
fall
within
the
meaning
of
game
first
the
commission
look
at
that
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
of
gaming
and
find
that
game
in
its
ordinary
dictionary
meaning
be
synonymous
or
interchangeable
with
gambling
and
that
actually
support
in
the
congressional
record
when
we
see
that
colloquy
between
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
where
the
first
thing
I
think
that
senator
lincoln
comment
say
be
this
section
of
the
cea
5cc5c
be
intend
to
prevent
gambling
use
the
future
market
for
gamble
the
court
how
do
you
define
gamble
ms
stuke
let
I
come
back
to
the
definition
so
game
in
ordinary
dictionary
definition
be
synonymous
with
gambling
there
actually
a
supreme
court
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
also
for
that
proposition
they
interchangeable
term
the
court
okay
ms
stuke
so
what
gamble
the
commission
look
at
various
definition
under
state
law
of
how
gambling
be
define
and
a
common
thread
in
many
state
law
definition
of
gambling
be
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
other
it
within
a
common
thread
a
frequently
use
phrasing
include
in
the
definition
of
gambling
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
other
a
number
of
state
link
the
term
game
or
gambling
to
bet
or
wager
on
election
the
commission
also
look
at
this
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
which
have
the
definition
of
to
bet
or
wager
bet
or
wagering
be
a
common
definition
of
gambling
and
in
that
statute
wager
on
a
contest
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
other
be
include
in
the
definition
the
court
can
I
ask
you
a
question
ms
stuke
yeah
absolutely
the
court
besides
election
in
your
view
be
there
a
contest
of
other
that
do
involve
a
game
as
plaintiff
would
define
what
game
mean
ms
stuke
I
actually
think
the
horse
race
be
a
game
but
there
be
contest
academy
awards
award
type
of
thing
that
do
seem
like
a
game
just
seem
like
a
contest
so
the
court
okay
so
an
event
contract
on
something
about
one
of
these
award
would
fall
under
the
gaming
or
gambling
prong
ms
stuke
first
of
all
I
do
want
to
get
ahead
of
my
commission
which
the
commission
do
define
it
define
do
talk
about
whether
the
in
this
order
do
get
into
other
example
because
it
be
sufficient
to
determine
that
election
fall
within
this
ordinary
definition
of
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
other
the
court
right
I
try
to
make
sure
that
I
understand
what
the
term
mean
in
the
statute
so
it
certainly
relevant
for
I
to
understand
how
this
would
apply
even
beyond
this
case
while
I
know
I
only
look
at
the
order
in
this
case
so
base
on
what
you
say
an
event
contract
about
any
kind
of
contest
like
an
award
show
academy
award
grammy
ms
stuke
it
not
a
game
it
seem
like
a
contest
the
court
that
would
fall
under
the
gaming
prong
ms
stuke
wager
on
it
it
sound
look
it
might
yeah
the
court
keep
go
ms
stuke
so
one
of
the
criticism
that
kalshi
levy
at
the
commission
decision
here
be
they
say
that
the
definition
be
gerrymander
because
it
include
only
wager
something
or
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
other
and
gaming
can
be
so
much
more
than
that
gaming
can
be
game
gaming
can
be
so
much
more
than
that
what
the
commission
do
however
be
it
look
at
what
be
these
contract
these
contract
be
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
election
do
that
fit
in
an
ordinary
definition
of
gaming
we
submit
yes
because
gaming
be
interchangeable
with
gambling
and
ordinary
meaning
of
gambling
be
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
other
and
an
election
be
a
contest
by
its
plain
meaning
dictionary
definition
define
contest
to
include
election
the
example
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
talk
about
the
presidential
election
as
a
contest
the
presidential
contest
mean
an
election
so
game
reasonably
and
plainly
include
by
its
plain
meaning
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
contest
of
other
this
might
not
be
to
the
exclusion
of
other
type
of
gaming
and
gambling
that
be
not
at
issue
in
this
particular
matter
but
these
contract
be
design
to
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
election
the
court
but
the
definition
do
change
base
on
the
contract
at
issue
right
the
statute
say
what
it
say
ms
stuke
the
statute
say
what
it
say
the
court
and
it
your
role
to
determine
whether
you
undertake
this
type
of
review
under
the
statute
then
you
decide
or
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contract
fit
the
definition
so
the
definition
do
change
it
whether
the
contract
fit
the
definition
so
it
can
be
I
not
go
to
find
gambling
mean
contest
here
and
then
in
another
case
be
give
a
different
definition
from
the
commission
about
what
gambling
might
mean
base
on
the
contract
at
issue
there
that
not
what
you
suggest
ms
stuke
what
I
be
suggest
be
that
because
this
be
not
a
rule
make
that
the
commission
determination
of
whether
these
contract
fit
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
do
not
require
the
commission
to
define
game
entire
universe
for
it
to
determine
that
these
contract
fit
within
an
ordinary
meaning
of
game
the
court
I
guess
that
what
I
have
difficulty
with
because
what
I
hear
you
say
be
that
there
could
be
many
definition
and
we
pick
the
one
applicable
here
if
there
be
many
definition
I
hope
no
one
be
ask
I
to
find
this
be
an
ambiguous
statute
this
be
not
the
time
to
deal
with
ambiguity
in
statutory
interpretation
so
I
guess
I
mean
I
hope
that
the
commission
be
take
the
position
that
gaming
mean
x
and
that
this
contract
fit
x
because
of
whatever
argument
you
not
say
that
you
add
a
contest
here
but
in
other
circumstance
you
use
another
dictionary
definition
there
should
be
a
definition
that
apply
that
unambiguous
ms
stuke
what
the
commission
find
here
be
an
ordinary
definition
of
gaming
include
wager
on
a
contest
of
other
because
and
that
not
as
kalshi
put
it
gerrymander
the
court
I
can
accept
that
ms
stuke
that
decide
what
before
it
the
court
I
can
accept
that
in
the
dictionary
there
may
be
one
two
three
and
if
it
fit
any
of
those
prong
I
just
want
to
know
the
extent
of
what
the
definition
of
gambling
be
under
the
commission
view
so
what
you
say
be
it
include
this
contest
of
other
and
so
because
an
election
in
your
view
be
a
contest
of
other
then
bet
or
wager
on
that
violate
that
provision
of
the
statute
ms
stuke
or
at
least
bring
it
into
that
enumerate
category
of
the
statute
yes
the
court
okay
but
if
there
be
other
definition
of
gambling
and
I
lose
track
of
whether
I
see
it
myself
or
whether
it
in
the
paper
but
that
would
just
say
for
example
you
might
have
say
it
early
bet
or
wager
on
a
contingent
event
ms
stuke
on
any
contingent
event
the
court
on
any
contingent
event
would
that
mean
that
every
event
contract
involve
gambling
and
thus
game
ms
stuke
that
not
what
the
commission
hold
here
and
it
unlikely
to
be
what
the
commission
would
hold
in
another
context
if
it
come
up
but
that
be
the
question
present
here
so
what
be
present
here
be
do
these
contract
which
be
routinely
characterize
as
election
bet
contract
fall
within
the
ordinary
meaning
an
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
where
gaming
be
synonymous
with
gambling
and
gambling
include
wager
on
a
contest
of
other
and
a
contest
of
other
include
election
and
that
be
enough
the
court
okay
ms
stuke
to
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
we
talk
about
gaming
and
unlawful
under
state
law
and
involve
and
unless
your
honor
want
to
talk
far
about
any
of
those
subissue
I
can
move
on
to
the
public
interest
the
court
sure
yes
please
ms
stuke
okay
so
having
determine
that
kalshi
propose
contract
involve
two
enumerate
activity
under
the
statute
the
commission
proceed
to
determine
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
public
interest
and
therefore
be
prohibit
from
trading
and
in
make
this
determination
the
commission
consider
the
contract
economic
purpose
as
well
as
other
factor
so
I
start
with
the
economic
purpose
evaluation
so
the
party
point
this
out
in
our
brief
but
our
statute
here
the
cea
codify
two
public
interest
in
commodity
market
hedging
and
price
discovery
so
hedge
in
general
mean
to
use
the
commodity
derivative
market
to
manage
risk
of
price
fluctuation
in
commodity
for
example
we
put
in
our
brief
an
example
of
an
airline
they
have
to
buy
jet
fuel
to
operate
their
business
and
they
have
a
price
sensitivity
to
movement
in
the
price
of
jet
fuel
so
a
market
participant
who
want
to
hedge
their
risk
of
price
fluctuation
and
they
worry
that
the
price
of
a
commodity
will
go
up
will
hedge
that
risk
by
enter
into
a
commodity
derivative
contract
whose
value
will
go
up
if
the
price
of
that
commodity
increase
so
in
other
word
hedging
mean
you
can
enter
into
a
derivative
contract
in
a
cftc
regulate
market
that
will
move
in
your
financial
interest
if
the
commodity
that
you
sensitive
to
move
against
your
financial
interest
that
hedge
price
discovery
which
be
the
other
enumerate
public
interest
in
the
cea
and
in
commodity
derivative
market
generally
mean
to
determine
a
price
level
for
a
commodity
base
upon
its
pricing
in
a
cftc
regulate
market
so
for
instance
future
contract
on
like
agricultural
commodity
can
be
use
the
trading
on
future
contract
can
be
use
to
discover
the
price
of
the
actual
commodity
in
the
cash
market
as
note
in
the
order
the
commission
consider
the
public
interest
of
kalshi
propose
contract
and
consider
their
economic
purpose
so
this
statute
5cc5c
do
define
what
it
mean
to
consider
the
public
interest
but
because
the
cea
itself
codify
economic
interest
in
the
year
before
2000
when
the
cftc
examine
every
derivative
contract
for
public
interest
it
look
at
an
economic
purpose
test
that
ask
whether
a
contract
can
be
reasonably
expect
to
be
or
have
be
use
for
hedging
or
price
base
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
that
be
the
test
and
the
cftc
look
at
that
test
in
consider
whether
these
propose
contract
have
an
economic
purpose
and
the
cftc
also
mention
this
colloquy
between
senator
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
which
senator
feinstein
ask
if
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
be
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominate
use
of
the
contract
be
speculative
as
oppose
to
hedging
or
economic
use
so
the
commission
cite
both
of
these
formulation
of
consider
the
economic
purpose
of
the
contract
in
evaluate
these
propose
contract
and
it
consider
comment
that
kalshi
highlight
for
your
honor
that
congressional
control
have
economic
effect
and
it
consider
comment
from
commenter
that
say
they
would
use
these
contract
to
hedge
but
as
the
commission
find
the
economic
effect
of
one
chamber
of
congress
or
another
be
the
word
the
commission
use
be
diffuse
and
unpredictable
the
price
of
these
contract
be
not
correlate
to
the
price
of
any
commodity
and
so
the
price
of
the
contract
could
reasonably
or
predictably
be
use
to
establish
commercial
transaction
price
for
hedging
or
discovery
the
court
can
I
get
a
clarification
be
the
test
be
it
the
more
than
occasional
language
or
be
it
the
predominantly
for
commercial
purpose
ms
stuke
the
test
the
commission
evaluate
both
it
look
at
both
and
find
that
even
consider
the
comment
that
suggest
pardon
I
that
these
contract
would
be
use
for
hedge
purpose
most
of
the
comment
suggest
that
the
hedging
us
be
not
really
related
to
the
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
but
rather
the
ultimate
change
in
law
or
policy
that
could
be
affect
many
step
down
the
line
from
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
so
even
take
all
the
commenter
together
who
state
an
intent
to
hedge
economic
risk
by
trade
these
contract
it
do
establish
that
the
contract
would
be
use
for
hedge
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
but
even
if
there
be
robust
economic
purpose
for
these
contract
the
economic
purpose
of
the
contract
be
just
one
aspect
of
the
evaluation
here
because
a
contract
with
economic
purpose
an
event
contract
even
if
it
have
an
economic
purpose
it
do
make
it
per
se
in
the
public
interest
there
an
example
actually
in
the
colloquy
of
the
congressional
record
you
can
have
a
contract
on
whether
a
terrorist
event
will
occur
and
it
could
be
use
for
hedge
even
if
you
go
to
suffer
an
economic
consequence
from
that
it
do
make
it
in
the
public
interest
it
do
make
it
a
good
idea
so
the
commission
here
consider
the
alleged
economic
purpose
of
these
contract
and
it
find
that
these
contract
could
not
because
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
the
impact
for
economic
hedging
be
so
diffuse
there
be
so
many
step
that
be
involve
between
the
election
and
actual
enactment
of
legislation
that
the
economic
purpose
of
these
contract
do
not
weigh
in
favor
of
their
public
interest
but
it
consider
other
aspect
too
I
want
to
address
one
thing
that
kalshi
argue
that
the
commission
impose
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
direct
effect
test
state
that
these
contract
do
have
a
direct
economic
effect
simply
because
a
single
chamber
of
congress
do
itself
have
the
power
to
enact
law
be
not
an
arbitrary
test
it
a
description
of
the
limited
hedging
utility
that
these
contract
would
have
but
again
even
if
these
contract
have
a
robust
economic
purpose
other
factor
play
in
to
the
public
interest
determination
and
they
do
here
so
I
talk
about
election
integrity
unless
your
honor
would
like
to
talk
about
the
economic
purpose
the
court
I
guess
the
only
question
be
plaintiff
make
an
argument
in
their
brief
and
I
talk
to
they
a
little
today
about
even
put
aside
any
legislation
that
pass
just
the
mere
fact
of
election
that
dictate
who
be
in
control
of
what
chamber
have
maybe
impact
on
the
stock
market
or
other
direct
economic
consequence
that
be
real
and
tangible
and
that
can
be
observe
in
the
aftermath
of
election
and
I
want
to
know
what
your
response
be
to
that
ms
stuke
my
response
be
maybe
something
you
already
say
which
be
even
if
there
be
economic
benefit
to
trade
these
contract
the
commission
determine
in
its
discretion
that
those
be
not
outweigh
by
the
very
serious
public
interest
the
court
so
you
do
dispute
that
ms
stuke
I
find
that
even
if
it
true
it
do
make
a
difference
because
the
commission
be
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
its
determination
that
the
concern
about
election
integrity
here
overwhelmingly
be
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
court
okay
let
go
to
the
election
integrity
ms
stuke
so
factor
include
specific
concern
about
election
integrity
support
the
commission
determination
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
public
interest
and
the
principal
concern
that
the
commission
identify
include
that
these
contract
could
create
monetary
incentive
for
individual
or
organized
group
to
vote
for
particular
candidate
for
financial
gain
to
win
a
bet
not
the
court
and
before
you
say
to
win
a
bet
I
be
think
you
describe
what
I
think
happen
now
in
real
life
in
term
of
the
financial
incentive
of
people
put
money
behind
election
and
what
motivate
people
to
vote
for
certain
candidate
be
often
financial
in
nature
right
but
you
say
specifically
to
collect
on
these
event
contract
ms
stuke
these
event
contract
their
very
existence
would
establish
could
establish
a
financial
incentive
to
vote
in
a
particular
way
that
do
presently
exist
because
these
contract
be
not
trade
anywhere
you
can
gamble
on
election
so
they
can
incentivize
vote
in
particular
way
that
could
influence
how
people
vote
the
court
how
would
we
ever
measure
that
ms
stuke
well
the
the
court
the
reason
I
ask
be
because
I
think
the
plaintiff
argument
be
that
concern
be
so
unlikely
to
happen
it
and
I
think
that
they
make
a
good
argument
today
that
there
be
already
so
many
incentive
financial
and
otherwise
behind
election
that
motivate
people
to
do
certain
thing
I
mean
the
point
be
that
if
there
be
some
way
to
get
control
over
a
if
someone
could
figure
out
a
way
to
ensure
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
that
probably
would
have
happen
by
now
right
so
what
be
your
response
to
that
ms
stuke
my
response
be
the
existence
of
a
federally
regulate
derivative
contract
on
the
outcome
of
election
could
incentivize
people
to
manipulate
either
that
contract
or
the
election
itself
for
financial
gain
I
give
you
some
example
to
talk
about
the
kind
of
thing
we
concern
about
and
I
skip
ahead
to
the
order
I
be
go
to
talk
with
you
about
these
thing
the
commission
be
not
just
a
regulatory
agency
we
also
a
law
enforcement
agency
and
we
task
under
the
cea
with
antifraud
authority
and
we
task
under
the
cea
to
ensure
integrity
in
the
market
that
we
oversee
and
because
of
that
the
commission
could
be
draw
in
to
investigate
manipulative
conduct
in
these
market
in
a
way
that
do
outside
of
its
ordinary
mission
so
here
an
example
a
political
activist
with
a
big
social
medium
follow
they
float
a
rumor
on
social
medium
damaging
to
a
candidate
who
be
important
to
one
party
control
of
the
senate
in
a
couple
of
week
this
rumor
spin
up
and
spin
out
and
it
turn
out
maybe
it
untrue
it
turn
out
to
be
false
but
during
the
week
that
the
rumor
be
circulate
the
congressional
control
contract
on
the
other
party
go
up
and
many
people
make
a
lot
of
money
by
sell
that
contract
when
the
market
be
high
and
then
the
cftc
get
a
tip
and
say
well
that
person
put
that
rumor
on
social
medium
in
order
to
manipulate
the
congressional
control
contract
there
a
couple
of
implication
here
the
very
availability
of
that
contract
have
add
one
more
reason
and
maybe
a
big
reason
for
some
people
to
disseminate
false
information
about
election
and
that
certainly
relevant
to
the
public
interest
another
thing
that
the
commission
consider
here
be
that
it
would
draw
the
commission
into
investigate
these
kind
of
activity
and
that
not
farfetche
the
court
be
that
something
that
the
commission
be
task
with
do
now
I
assume
there
be
other
contract
I
probably
could
come
up
with
an
example
of
any
contract
that
could
be
subject
to
some
manipulation
where
there
money
involve
be
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
commission
would
typically
investigate
if
there
be
an
issue
with
okay
ms
stuke
absolutely
your
honor
as
a
federal
regulator
of
commodity
market
the
cftc
as
I
say
be
in
charge
of
ensure
price
integrity
on
our
federally
regulate
exchange
in
the
ordinary
course
there
many
way
to
manipulate
market
now
I
say
this
in
the
same
breath
that
I
say
I
think
the
market
regulate
by
the
cftc
be
among
the
safe
in
the
rule
but
the
limit
of
manipulation
be
really
just
the
limit
of
human
ingenuity
manipulation
be
attempt
and
the
cftc
as
a
law
enforcement
agency
routinely
investigate
allegation
of
fraud
and
manipulation
in
the
market
that
it
oversee
the
court
I
ask
that
because
when
I
read
your
brief
it
sound
like
one
of
the
argument
you
be
make
be
that
if
you
have
to
do
that
in
this
circumstance
it
would
put
you
in
a
position
that
the
cftc
be
not
equip
to
do
but
it
sound
like
if
it
part
of
your
regular
mission
it
would
put
you
in
a
position
that
you
not
already
require
or
routinely
do
ms
stuke
my
answer
to
that
your
honor
be
that
there
be
two
important
difference
because
this
be
not
a
minimal
concern
it
not
simple
enough
to
say
oh
but
you
investigate
manipulation
in
market
that
you
not
an
expert
in
all
the
time
and
it
true
we
have
a
division
of
enforcement
that
investigate
allege
manipulation
in
a
lot
of
market
on
a
lot
of
commodity
the
difference
here
there
be
two
important
difference
first
and
most
important
any
government
investigation
and
enforcement
activity
involve
the
political
process
be
inherently
sensitive
there
a
difference
in
the
cftc
investigate
economic
activity
relate
to
commodity
derivative
market
and
the
cftc
investigate
act
that
may
be
political
speech
or
other
conduct
central
to
the
political
process
second
as
we
brief
and
as
the
commission
find
in
its
order
most
of
the
market
regulate
by
the
cftc
have
objective
economic
datum
that
may
not
totally
decide
a
case
but
at
a
minimum
it
provide
some
objective
grounding
through
the
cftc
investigation
of
whether
manipulation
have
occur
the
vast
potential
of
these
contract
to
incentivize
misinformation
could
absolutely
draw
the
commission
into
investigation
of
a
vast
array
of
possible
manipulation
the
pricing
of
these
congressional
control
contract
would
be
impact
by
such
a
broad
array
of
information
anything
that
could
influence
the
election
could
influence
the
price
of
these
contract
so
poll
rumor
news
announcement
fake
information
advertisement
I
can
even
think
of
it
all
and
this
would
be
for
every
congressional
race
in
the
country
kalshi
do
have
jurisdiction
to
investigate
any
allege
manipulation
on
these
contract
it
would
fall
to
the
cftc
in
its
everyday
operation
the
cftc
receive
tip
of
possible
market
manipulation
and
it
would
be
draw
into
investigate
whether
information
disseminate
about
congressional
election
illegally
manipulate
the
market
in
these
contract
and
that
be
not
a
role
for
which
the
commission
be
equip
and
it
would
greatly
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
cftc
assume
the
role
of
an
election
cop
raise
very
serious
concern
about
not
only
the
misalignment
of
that
role
with
the
commission
mission
and
its
history
but
with
election
integrity
and
it
be
reasonable
for
the
cftc
to
have
consider
this
as
another
example
it
not
farfetche
it
not
a
de
minimus
concern
kalshi
say
oh
it
not
a
big
deal
you
do
that
anyway
or
it
not
likely
to
happen
the
commission
predict
judgment
base
upon
its
existence
as
a
law
enforcement
agency
that
routinely
investigate
manipulation
and
as
a
regulatory
agency
that
be
entrust
with
ensure
the
integrity
of
its
market
it
be
a
reasonable
predictive
judgment
to
say
that
that
would
draw
the
cftc
into
investigate
conduct
that
relate
to
election
there
another
example
there
another
example
I
want
to
talk
with
your
honor
about
and
that
would
be
you
ask
kalshi
counsel
about
the
limit
that
it
propose
to
put
on
who
could
trade
these
contract
as
far
as
I
read
that
list
it
would
prohibit
people
who
count
the
vote
from
trade
in
these
contract
so
imagine
a
scenario
and
the
position
limit
mean
how
much
can
be
trade
on
these
contract
the
position
limit
propose
would
allow
trading
of
up
to
5
million
if
you
a
company
or
entity
so
imagine
a
group
of
poll
worker
and
I
do
mean
people
that
be
involve
in
survey
I
mean
people
that
count
the
vote
they
form
a
company
of
some
kind
and
they
accuse
of
put
their
money
together
and
put
a
5
million
position
on
these
congressional
control
contract
these
be
the
people
count
the
vote
someone
refer
this
to
the
cftc
because
they
think
the
vote
counting
have
be
manipulate
to
make
a
profit
in
the
event
contract
so
here
would
be
the
cftc
be
draw
into
whether
the
vote
count
be
accurate
the
court
or
whether
there
be
fraud
in
connection
with
the
event
contract
right
ms
stuke
correct
because
it
would
ask
the
question
of
whether
there
be
fraud
in
the
event
contract
because
that
would
be
manipulate
manipulative
or
fraudulent
conduct
that
unduly
influence
the
event
contract
and
that
an
example
of
the
cftc
concern
because
these
contract
could
their
very
existence
could
incentivize
conduct
design
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
for
the
purpose
of
manipulate
the
price
of
the
contract
for
financial
gain
or
they
could
incentivize
the
manipulation
of
the
market
for
the
purpose
of
artificially
affect
the
election
or
perception
of
the
election
I
want
to
mention
one
thing
that
kalshi
talk
about
and
that
be
oh
actually
before
I
get
there
research
in
the
record
one
comment
submit
in
the
record
involve
the
actual
manipulation
of
a
political
event
contract
by
false
information
there
be
it
a
bizarre
fact
pattern
the
pop
singer
kid
rock
be
show
to
be
ahead
in
the
poll
in
a
match
up
against
a
sit
senator
before
he
have
ever
he
have
not
even
declare
a
candidacy
for
the
senate
but
he
be
show
in
a
poll
to
be
ahead
of
a
sit
senator
and
that
cause
the
price
of
a
corresponding
event
contract
to
drop
and
it
cause
trading
volume
to
surge
and
user
be
later
on
social
medium
brag
about
how
that
poll
troll
the
news
medium
and
influence
the
election
event
contract
researcher
have
theorize
that
that
kind
of
fake
information
could
be
use
to
generate
market
movement
in
other
election
event
contract
so
it
not
farfetche
to
say
that
this
be
a
serious
concern
over
600
comment
letter
be
receive
by
the
agency
include
from
senator
and
member
of
the
house
of
representative
express
significant
concern
about
election
integrity
and
the
improper
commodification
of
our
election
and
I
do
say
commodification
just
as
rhetorical
flourish
when
you
have
an
event
contract
trading
on
a
cftc
regulate
market
and
the
underlying
event
of
that
contract
be
an
election
the
election
be
a
commodity
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
where
a
large
number
of
state
have
specifically
disallow
gambling
on
election
by
either
statute
or
common
law
and
that
reflect
the
view
of
a
large
number
of
state
that
this
kind
of
wagering
be
against
the
public
interest
the
commission
grant
significant
weight
to
any
threat
to
election
integrity
as
well
as
the
threat
to
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
this
be
especially
important
at
a
point
in
time
where
so
many
people
question
the
validity
of
election
the
commission
be
not
require
to
let
threat
to
election
integrity
happen
before
recognize
election
integrity
as
a
public
interest
concern
with
respect
to
these
contract
there
one
other
value
that
kalshi
argue
that
kalshi
and
amici
and
commenter
argue
that
these
contract
have
and
that
be
that
they
could
provide
beneficial
market
base
predictive
datum
and
that
that
societally
valuable
information
the
commission
consider
that
but
it
do
find
that
generation
of
such
datum
outweigh
the
very
real
and
grave
concern
about
the
threat
to
election
integrity
that
these
contract
would
pose
the
cftc
predictive
judgment
about
possible
negative
consequence
that
could
arise
from
these
propose
contract
be
entitle
to
deference
under
apa
law
the
commission
do
ignore
evidence
it
do
refuse
to
engage
with
contrary
position
it
find
that
any
economic
utility
of
the
contract
do
outweigh
the
very
serious
risk
that
the
contract
could
be
manipulate
and
could
incentivize
the
spread
of
misinformation
or
be
use
to
undermine
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of
election
integrity
so
for
all
of
these
reason
the
cftc
submit
that
your
honor
should
deny
kalshi
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
grant
judgment
to
the
cftc
the
court
okay
thank
you
any
brief
rebuttal
mr
roth
very
brief
very
very
brief
the
court
yes
mr
roth
I
appreciate
the
court
time
I
will
be
very
very
brief
three
quick
point
first
your
honor
ask
about
the
catchall
category
why
they
do
rely
on
the
catchall
the
court
yes
mr
roth
the
catchall
require
a
rule
make
it
by
rule
or
regulation
they
have
do
a
rule
making
and
so
that
they
could
rely
on
the
catchall
the
court
they
could
not
rely
on
the
catchall
mr
roth
yes
so
they
would
first
have
to
do
a
rule
make
to
determine
some
activity
be
similar
to
the
other
they
have
not
do
that
so
that
the
answer
to
that
the
court
thank
you
I
appreciate
that
mr
roth
on
unlawful
I
still
do
not
really
hear
a
theory
as
to
why
their
reading
do
sweep
in
everything
what
I
hear
be
you
do
have
to
worry
about
that
because
that
not
this
case
that
not
how
statutory
interpretation
work
we
need
to
understand
what
the
statute
mean
counsel
admit
that
a
de
novo
question
for
this
court
to
consider
and
of
course
in
consider
what
the
statute
mean
the
court
be
go
to
look
at
how
it
would
apply
in
other
context
that
do
mean
you
need
to
figure
out
the
answer
to
every
other
hypothetical
case
that
might
exist
but
the
supreme
court
whenever
it
consider
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
look
at
how
it
go
to
apply
elsewhere
and
if
it
go
to
be
absurd
in
a
wide
variety
of
other
case
that
mean
it
a
bad
interpretation
that
I
think
cover
unlawful
the
only
thing
I
say
about
gaming
to
add
to
early
your
honor
ask
if
their
interpretation
of
contest
would
sweep
in
anything
that
be
a
game
other
than
election
and
counsel
response
be
potentially
award
show
like
who
go
to
win
the
emmy
or
the
oscar
which
I
think
be
a
fascinating
example
because
kalshi
offer
those
and
have
offer
those
for
a
long
time
and
they
have
never
subject
those
to
the
review
process
and
I
think
that
really
underscore
the
sort
of
outcome
drive
aspect
of
this
it
not
a
good
faith
statutory
interpretation
it
an
attempt
to
get
it
in
without
a
real
coherent
theory
of
what
the
statute
mean
that
all
I
have
your
honor
unless
you
have
further
question
the
court
no
thank
you
I
appreciate
the
brief
be
very
good
and
helpful
and
I
appreciate
your
time
before
we
leave

embarrass
