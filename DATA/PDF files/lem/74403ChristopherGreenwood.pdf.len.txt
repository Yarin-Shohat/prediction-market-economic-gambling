an

market
do
not
replace
other
method
of
forecasting
or
analyze
information
it
rather
add
an
important
tool
to
help
make
well
inform
decision
prediction

be
similar
in

other
market
the
price

a
stock
bond

sense
a

routinely
use

first
the
market
mechanism
allow
for
near
real
time
incorporation
of
new
information
in
contrast
other
tool
such
as
public
polling
only
offer
a
snapshot
in
time
and
can
lag
in
reflect
the
shift
in
public
sentiment
as
situation
change
second
the
market
mechanism
create
a
financial
incentive
for
individual
to
express
what
they
believe
will
happen
not
what
they
hope
will
happen
or
even
necessarily
want
to
have
happen
this
too
be
well
than
rely
on
many
of
the
alternative
for
example
political
analyst
can
provide
insight
but
may
have
incentive
to
generate
support
for
a
particular
position
or
outcome
or
social
pressure
sometimes
lead
individual
to
share
what
they
believe
be
the
right
opinion
even
if
it
differ
from
their
private
view
recent
research
have
find
that
across
all
demographic
every
subgroup
have
multiple
issue
with
a
double
digit
gap
between
public
and
private
opinion
populace
insight
private
opinion
in
america
populace
one
consequence
be
that
individual
may
publicly
misrepresent
their
own
private
view
in
public
polling
or
focus
group
finally
participant
may
not
individually
have
all
the
need
information
but
the
market
mechanism
create
an
incentive
to
reveal
what
they
know
which
be
then

to
produce
the

application
we
need
a

that
would
allow
for

few
prediction

to
contribute
to
