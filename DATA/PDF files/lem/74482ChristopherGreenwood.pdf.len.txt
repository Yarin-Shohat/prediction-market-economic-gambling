that

as

I

introduction
our
derivative
market
be
crucial
for
the
american
economy
as
you
know
they
allow
business
and
individual
alike
to
hedge
risk
express
market
view
and
discover
price
without
these
market
we
struggle
to
effectively
and
efficiently
manage
economic
risk
and
remain
competitive
I
be
deeply
trouble
by
the
recent
proposal
put
forth
by
the
cftc
the
federal
agency
that
be
task
with
administer
the
cea
in
prohibit
broad
category
of
contract
the
cftc
proposal
rely
heavily
on
a
2010
senate
colloquy
between
I
and
the
late
senator
feinstein
for
support
but
the
cftc
proposal
go
well
beyond
what
we
intend
this
heavy
handed
proposal
to
ban
market
rather
than
regulate
they
risk
undermine
the
core
principle
that
underpin
our
financial
market
principle
we
strive
to
uphold
through
carefully
craft
legislation
that
encourage
innovation
and
provide
consumer
protection
of
course
there
be
instrument
that
should
not
be
trade
on
any
financial
market
instrument
about
war
terrorism
and
assassination
might
be
inappropriate
for
the
market
this
be
precisely
why
we
include
rule
in
the
cea
that
give
the
government
authority
to
prohibit
contract
about
war
terrorism
and
assassination
we
also
believe
that
our
future
market
be
not
mean
for
gambling
and
so
we
also
give
the
government
the
authority
to
prohibit
gambling
contract
about
game
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
the
master
tournament
but
outside
these
narrow
category
the
law
be
clear
that
the
cftc
have
the
responsibility
to
regulate
contract
not
ban
they
now
however
the
cftc
be
attempt
to
prohibit
all
sort
of
financial
instrument
from
instrument
that
have
any
relation
to
sport
such
as
attendance
and
rating
of
a
championship
game
to
instrument
involve
political
election
to
contract
about
the
nobel
prize
as
the
cftc
see
it
these
be
game
contract
and
therefore
fall
under
the
prohibition
we
draft
in
2010
however
it
be
my
view
that
this
interpretation
entirely
miss
the
mark
the
law
be
mean
to
capture
recreational
gambling
on
sporting
event
and
casino
type
activity
not
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
or
the
outcome
of
major
election
these
event
be
nothing
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
or
the
master
tournament
if
we
have
intend
to
include
these
event
we
would
have
do
so
explicitly
we
do
not
because
those
event
unlike
the
result
of
a
sport
match
have
real
and
significant
economic
consequence
prohibit
future
contract
on
those
event
would
therefore
inhibit
the
sort
of
legitimate
economic
activity
that
our
market
be
design
to
promote
further
it
would
push
this
exist
legal
economic
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
market
with
little
to
no
consumer
protection
by
define
gaming
so
broadly
the
cftc
propose
rule
cast
a
dangerous
shadow
over
the
entire
industry
speculating
have
risk
but
it
be
not
recreational
gambling
take
a
position
on
a
future
event
with
commercial
significance
in
a
commercial
manner
be
not
recreational
gambling
consider
a
small
business
owner
for
example
who
own
a
sport
bar
in
a
city
whose
baseball
team
be
do
well
if
they
hire
more
staff
in
anticipation
of
their
team
make
it
far
into
the
playoff
with
the
accompany
pack
night
at
the
bar
they
have
not
gamble
rather
they
have
make
a
prudent
speculative
and
commercial
investment
for
a
real
economic
purpose
buy
a
contract
that
pay
out
if
their
team
fall
short
of
the
playoff
be
gamble
either
this
be
a
prudent
investment
that
allow
the
bar
owner
to
hedge
their
risk
of
a
potential
economic
loss
if
the
team
season
do
go
as
hop
or
let
consider
someone
who
be
bullish
on
the
prospect
of
a
new
technology
who
invest
in
company
that
be
develop
that
hardware
or
software
they
have
not
gamble
either
they
have
invest
in
a
speculative
position
how
about
a
farmer
or
a
rancher
that
speculate
on
the
future
price
of
rice
corn
or
cattle
on
the
future
market
they
be
certainly
not
gamble
the
opportunity
to
hedge
risk
should
not
be
limit
to
the
wealthy
individual
and
corporation
who
can
access
these
type
of
innovative
risk
management
product
through
large
investment
bank
under
the
cftc
propose
rule
sensible
commercial
activity
would
be
categorize
and
prohibit
as
gambling
that
do
only
blur
the
line
between
gambling
and
legitimate
commercial
activity
it
obliterate
it
the
foundational
premise
of
the
cftc
new
rule
be
that
it
equate
all
legitimate
commercial
speculative
activity
with
gamble
the
early
history
of
market
be
replete
with
similar
accusation
that
market
be
nothing
but
gamble
dens
that
accusation
have
since
be
disproven
by
the
unparalleled
economic
growth
make
possible
by
our
financial
market
and
especially
by
our
derivative
market
american
future
market
be
strong
and
resilient
and
they
support
a
strong
and
resilient
economy
the
strength
and
vitality
of
our
market
rest
on
two
fundamental
pillar
robust
regulation
and
broad
participation
the
role
of
regulator
be
absolutely
crucial
the
ftx
collapse
clearly
illustrate
what
happen
without
strong
regulator
intervention
the
cftc
proposal
to
prohibit
market
be
not
regulate
they
it
be
a
failure
to
regulate
this
be
the
opposite
of
what
I
intend
with
dodd
frank
my
intention
be
to
create
a
robust
framework
for
regulate
market
not
ban
entire
market
I
be
proud
of
what
our
work
on
this
financial
reform
legislation
accomplish
and
I
be
hopeful
the
cftc
will
reconsider
its
current
proposal
on
event
contract
ii
specific
point
of
concern
the
cftc
proposal
misinterpret
my
colloquy
on
several
key
point
definition
of
game
the
cftc
propose
definition
of
game
misinterpret
the
intent
of
my
2010
senate
colloquy
the
cftc
rule
propose
to
classify
trade
as
gaming
base
on
the
subject
of
the
trade
trade
that
be
on
a
specific
subject
and
the
cftc
identify
four
subject
be
classify
as
gaming
and
trade
on
other
subject
be
not
game
that
mean
that
the
dividing
line
between
gaming
and
how
the
cftc
define
the
opposite
of
gaming
be
simply
the
subject
of
the
trade
in
the
cftc
proposal
the
only
distinction
the
cftc
be
propose
between
gaming
and
economic
trading
be
what
the
subject
of
the
trade
be
look
at
the
trader
the
facility
the
ecosystem
surround
the
trade
be
irrelevant
for
the
cftc
to
argue
that
the
only
discern
difference
between
gaming
activity
and
economic
trading
activity
be
the
subject
of
the
bet
be
contrary
to
my
intent
in
the
statutory
provision
of
dodd
frank
contrary
to
the
experience
of
the
industry
and
contrary
to
my
2010
colloquy
under
the
cftc
proposal
gaming
encompass
three
topic
none
of
which
be
in
the
statute
we
draft
and
none
of
which
be
in
my
colloquy
with
senator
feinstein
instead
the
cftc
propose
to
adopt
definition
of
gambling
from
unrelated
law
and
at
this
the
proposal
be
misguide
the
intent
of
the
statute
be
never
to
establish
taboo
topic
that
be
gamble
the
intent
of
the
statute
be
to
give
the
cftc
authority
to
distinguish
between
gambling
for
entertainment
and
economic
trading
the
dividing
line
between
recreational
gambling
and
economic
trading
that
occur
on
derivative
market
be
not
the
subject
of
the
trade
it
be
the
activity
the
activity
that
we
intend
to
keep
out
of
the
future
market
be
recreational
gambling
for
entertainment
the
gaming
that
we
refer
to
in
the
statute
describe
a
recreational
activity
that
be
for
entertainment
the
cftc
proposal
to
define
gaming
simply
base
on
the
subject
of
the
trade
be
contrary
to
my
intent
you
may
remember
that
in
our
2010
colloquy
we
specifically
highlight
the
super
bowl
people
gamble
on
who
will
win
the
super
bowl
and
the
event
have
enormous
economic
consequence
that
can
create
risk
that
can
be
hedge
manage
and
transfer
one
event
like
the
super
bowl
can
be
the
subject
of
both
gambling
and
legitimate
economic
activity
the
difference
between
the
two
be
that
economic
trading
be
not
do
for
recreation
and
gambling
for
entertainment
be
for
recreation
the
cftc
proposal
to
define
game
solely
base
on
the
subject
of
the
trade
abandon
the
regulatory
responsibility
to
investigate
and
ascertain
the
financial
utility
and
purpose
of
economic
trading
it
call
the
legitimacy
of
all
derivative
market
into
question
this
be
not
my
intent
and
be
contrary
to
our
colloquy
in
addition
to
the
concern
with
the
cftc
overall
propose
definition
of
game
the
specific
definition
it
propose
be
also
questionable
the
cftc
proposal
look
to
the
dictionary
definition
of
gambling
but
the
proposal
ignore
the
obvious
and
intended
definition
to
play
a
game
for
money
in
fact
nearly
every
definition
of
gaming
which
be
the
word
we
use
in
the
statute
incorporate
the
idea
of
play
a
game
the
gambling
that
we
refer
to
in
our
colloquy
be
clear
on
this
point
and
that
be
why
we
use
the
example
like
the
super
bowl
the
cftc
incredibly
broad
proposal
to
sweep
up
event
like
election
and
the
nobel
prize
for
physics
in
the
definition
of
gaming
go
way
too
far
election
be
not
game
I
think
that
now
at
this
time
in
history
it
be
especially
apparent
that
election
be
not
game
blanket
prohibition
the
cftc
propose
a
blanket
prohibition
on
all
contract
that
have
as
their
subject
one
of
the
activity
we
enumerate
in
the
statute
as
oppose
to
contract
specific
determination
this
be
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
most
certainly
contrary
to
my
intent
the
statute
be
intend
to
give
the
cftc
authority
to
make
determination
about
specific
contract
that
be
list
not
adopt
blanket
prohibition
one
of
the
hallmark
of
the
derivative
market
be
the
presumption
that
the
market
not
the
government
should
be
choose
how
they
hedge
their
risk
what
datum
to
ingest
and
what
to
trade
it
be
not
the
government
role
to
be
pick
winner
and
loser
in
our
financial
market
our
intent
with
the
provision
of
dodd
frank
be
to
recognize
that
there
may
be
instance
where
an
event
contract
should
not
be
list
but
these
instance
be
narrow
only
if
the
cftc
determine
that
a
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
a
specific
contract
prohibit
that
determination
must
be
make
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
we
be
live
in
a
time
of
significant
global
unrest
do
it
make
sense
that
the
cftc
can
foresee
that
every
event
contract
that
relate
to
the
subject
of
war
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
do
not
suggest
that
every
single
contract
which
reference
war
would
forever
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
we
do
we
would
have
forbid
those
contract
altogether
but
that
be
not
how
we
approach
the
issue
congress
say
that
event
contract
on
the
enumerate
activity
may
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
entire
category
of
contract
and
not
make
a
contract
by
contract
determination
of
public
interest
be
inconsistent
with
what
we
intend
in
the
statute
purpose
of
the
derivative
market
I
be
particularly
concerned
by
the
cftc
interpretation
of
the
derivative
industry
concept
of
hedge
price
formation
price
basing
and
speculate
in
justify
its
blanket
ban
over
contract
that
fit
its
propose
definition
of
game
the
cftc
say
that
the
commission
believe
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
other
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
include
the
outcome
of
such
contest
or
game
generally
be
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
change
in
the
price
of
commodity
or
other
financial
asset
or
instrument
limit
the
hedging
and
price
base
utility
of
an
event
contract
involve
such
an
occurrence
the
cftc
therefore
believe
that
the
outcome
of
an
election
for
example
do
not
pose
risk
to
market
participant
that
can
be
hedge
this
be
simply
untrue
election
have
enormous
economic
impact
and
pose
enormous
economic
risk
to
all
sort
of
party
from
individual
to
small
business
to
trade
association
to
large
corporation
the
reasoning
that
the
cftc
use
to
conclude
that
event
contract
will
have
limit
hedge
utility
and
pricebase
utility
be
mistake
the
derivative
market
be
successfully
use
to
hedge
by
transfer
risk
risk
be
not
limit
to
change
in
the
price
of
some
commodity
it
be
much
broad
than
that
dodd
frank
itself
be
a
testament
to
the
complexity
of
the
economy
and
the
risk
of
a
complex
and
interconnected
global
economy
the
cftc
assumption
that
election
do
pose
direct
financial
risk
be
false
and
its
dismissal
of
the
broad
risk
associate
with
election
be
wrong
too
risk
that
market
participant
face
however
diffuse
can
be
effectively
manage
by
transfer
the
risk
use
event
contract
additionally
the
cftc
ignore
one
of
the
historical
us
of
the
derivative
market
the
derivative
market
have
historically
be
utilize
as
aggregator
of
market
sentiment
price
form
as
participant
express
their
opinion
on
the
market
and
the
data
be
use
by
the
marketplace
as
a
gauge
of
market
sentiment
event
contract
provide
a
very
useful
mechanism
for
the
market
to
express
their
opinion
on
future
event
the
datum
that
can
come
from
these
event
contract
or
prediction
exchange
contract
can
be
very
valuable
and
it
be
a
hallmark
of
the
derivative
industry
that
market
participant
can
decide
what
information
be
useful
to
they
and
what
be
not
useful
similarly
the
cftc
concern
that
the
information
the
market
would
be
use
to
determine
its
view
of
a
fair
price
differ
from
the
informational
source
use
for
price
the
vast
majority
of
commodity
underlie
commission
regulate
derivative
contract
government
issue
crop
forecast
weather
forecast
federal
government
economic
data
market
derive
supply
and
demand
metric
for
commodity
market
base
interest
rate
curve
be
misplace
although
the
cftc
do
not
fully
articulate
what
the
exact
significance
of
this
difference
be
the
implication
be
that
the
price
basing
process
will
work
for
event
contract
this
underestimate
the
broad
input
that
market
use
to
price
many
traditional
commodity
such
as
oil
and
gold
where
participant
use
broad
input
to
determine
future
market
price
and
predict
future
market
demand
these
input
be
much
great
than
the
price
of
the
spot
market
commodity
this
be
certainly
true
for
equity
index
future
most
importantly
it
ignore
the
power
of
american
market
and
their
adeptness
at
ingest
information
the
cftc
premise
there
be
insufficient
reliable
information
to
form
price
be
unfortunately
misguide
all
this
reasoning
be
use
in
the
cftc
proposal
to
support
the
conclusion
that
contract
it
propose
to
classify
as
gaming
such
as
election
contract
will
not
be
use
for
hedging
or
price
basing
this
be
untrue
election
do
pose
risk
and
individual
and
business
should
have
a
means
to
hedge
that
risk
it
be
not
credible
to
say
that
datum
on
what
the
market
think
about
the
likely
outcome
of
election
be
not
incredibly
economically
important
I
hope
that
the
cftc
remember
the
early
day
of
some
of
the
other
product
it
regulate
and
the
lesson
that
it
learn
market
take
time
to
develop
speculator
play
an
incredibly
important
role
in
that
development
american
market
be
very
well
function
and
perhaps
most
importantly
it
the
market
that
should
decide
which
contract
succeed
the
cftc
should
let
the
market
thrive
under
careful
oversight
and
consumer
protection
iii
conclusion
as
our
economy
become
ever
more
complex
the
risk
that
event
pose
to
a
broad
range
of
market
participant
become
more
acute
it
be
critical
to
have
the
ability
to
manage
a
wide
variety
of
risk
and
to
aggregate
market
sentiment
the
derivative
market
be
ideal
