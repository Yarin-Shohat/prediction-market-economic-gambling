event
contract
nprm
as
far
explain
herein
paradigm
have
significant
concern
that
the
event
contract
nprm
represent
a
broad
and
untethered
ban
on
a
wide
variety
of
product
that
could
further
the
goal
of
the
cea
to
promote
responsible
innovation
see
cea
section
unfortunately
the
approach
set
forth
in
the
event
contract
nprm
be
to
ban
most
type
of
event
contract
without
conduct
any
review
of
the
term
of
the
particular
event
contract
develop
an
understanding
of
the
hedge
utility
of
the
product
or
otherwise
evaluate
the
merit
of
prediction
market
as
innovative
derivative
platform
that
far
democratic
value
the
cftc
instead
choose
to
take

as
far
explain
below
paradigm
urge
the
cftc
to
withdraw
the
event
contract
nprm
and
reconsider
its
approach
for
the
follow
reason
1
the
event
contract
nprm
would
outlaw
a
broad
class
of
innovative
derivative
product
before
market
participant
have
have
an
opportunity
to
fully
realize
their
benefit
the
cftc
decision
to
exile
these
product
to
minimally
regulate
offshore
and
over
the
counter
market
will
impair
opportunity
for
financial
innovation
domestically
2
the
cftc
proposal
be
less
motivated
by
an
earnest
desire
to
protect
the
public
than
an
aversion
to
event
contract
generally
as
far
explain
below
the
cftc
misinterpret
a
senate
colloquy
address
cea
section
in
a
manner
that
be
at
odd
with
the
plain
language
and
purpose
of
the
statute
moreover
the
cftc
fail
to
perform
the
analysis
require
under
section
in
excess
of
the
agency
statutory
jurisdiction
3
the
cftc
proposal
adopt
a
definition
of
the
term
gaming
that
be
profoundly
unclear
and
do
not
provide
any
articulable
standard
that
would
allow
for
a
market
participant
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
event
contract
involve
such
activity
this
level
of
regulatory
vagueness
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
4
political
event
contract
offer
a
plethora
of
concrete
benefit
that
the
event
contract
nprm
fail
to
adequately
consider
broadly
these
type
of
event
contract
can
encourage
participation
in
the
democratic
process
and
promote
trust
in
its
legitimacy
additionally
political
event
contract
allow
business
to
hedge
risk
associate
with
a
wide
range
of
political
and
electoral
factor
should
the
cftc
decide
not
to
withdraw
the
event
contract
nprm
it
should
at
the
very
least
narrow
the
scope
of
the
definition
of
gaming
as
explain
below
and
remove
any
public
interest
determination
from
the
rule
the
single
bad
move
the
cftc
could
make
be
to
let
this
rule
proceed
without
change
that
be
the
definition
of
a
risky
gamble
the
event
contract
nprm
be
a
value
base
subjective
regulation
that
would
outlaw
innovative
product
and
drive
burgeon
financial
technology
business
offshore
the
event
contract
nprm
propose
to
interpret
section
of
the
cea
which
provide
that
the
cftc
may
determine
that
an
event
contract
that
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
enumerate
activity
list
in
the
statute
include
an
activity
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism

gaming
and
other
similar
activity
determine
by
the
cftc
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
event
contract
nprm
the
cftc
conclude
that
any
contract
that
involve
an
enumerate
activity
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
can
not
legally
be
offer
for

or
clear
on
a
cftc
register
platform
as
explain
far
herein
the
cftc
interpretation
of
cea
section
be
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
do
not
provide
sufficient
analysis
to
allow
the
public
to
provide
informed
comment
and
be
excessively
broad
so
as
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
the
cea
prior
to
address
the
numerous
deficiency
with
the

submit
that
it

the

the

do
not
authorize
the

to

on
whether
a

rather
congress

see
fit

of

and
other
consideration
in
this

cea
section
should
be
read
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
overarching
statute
an
overly
broad
reading
of
this
section
authorize
the
cftc
to
make
a

determination
would
circumvent
the
intent
of
congress
for
the

to
generally
determine
whether
a

be

moreover
the

be
inconsistent
with

in
cftc

the

and
drive
a

of
financial

such
a

would
take

without
the

the

a

to
move
offshore
outside

of

and
to
the
detriment

the

the
