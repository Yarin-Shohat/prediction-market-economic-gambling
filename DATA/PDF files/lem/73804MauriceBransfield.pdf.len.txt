the

be
consider

when

it
then
proceed
to
expand
the

beyond

would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be

for

define
gaming
and
expand
its
application
the
event
contract
proposal
would
codify
a
definition
of
gaming
for
the
first
time
in
general
the
propose
definition
would
encompass
the
staking
or
risking
of
value
on
outcome
and
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
if
adopt
the
proposal
would
extend
the
reach
of
the
commission
event
contract
review
authority
beyond
its
current
interpretation
of
that
authority
this
expansion
be
most
notable
in
the
sport
bet
context
where
the
commission
event
contract
review
have
be
limit
to
game
outcome
and
total
point
accumulate
see
for
example
the
cftc

involve
three
nfl

one
base

the
second
on
the
point
spread
and
the
third
on
total
point
for
individual
nfl
game
available
at
the
commission
aim
to
reduce
the
number
of
individualized
contract
review
it
must
perform
but
note
there
may
continue
to
be
instance
where
contract
specific
review
be
appropriate
to
evaluate
potential
gaming
contract
event
contract
proposal
at
rely
on
state
law
gaming
definition
and
re
affirm
previous
interpretation
the
event
contract
proposal
define
game
as
the
staking
or
risk
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
other
the
outcome
of
a
game
involve
skill
or
chance
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitor
in
one
or
more
contest
or
game
or
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
emphasis
add
it
be
difficult
to
reconcile
the
proposal
definition
of
event
contract
associate
with
enumerate
activity
as
include
contract
in
connection
with
enumerate

with
the
cea
definition
of

contract
associate
with
enumerate

as
include
only

that
involve

apply
the
former
standard
will
likely
result
in
few
event

than
suggest
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the

specific
cftc
provide
example
of

that
would
be

the

could

it
decide

acknowledge
that
the

in
a

may
have

direct
and
more

economic

but
believe
this
be
a
small
component
of
the

express
a
view
that
