the

no

as
hundred

thus

the

would
enable

associate
with

of

while
generate

nevertheless
the
cftc
prohibit
kalshi
from

its

its
order
contort
and
misapplie
the
cea
text
ignore
its
structure
and
purpose
allow
a
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
and
engage
in
faulty
unsupported
reasoning
it
be
unlawful
and
must
be
vacate
for
three
independent
reason
first
in
conclude
that
kalshi
contract
involve
enumerate
activity
the
commission
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
that
word
in
this
statutory
framework
an
event
contract
involve
an
enumerate
activity
if
its
underlying
event
be
or
closely
relate
to
that
activity
for
example
a
contract
contingent
on
a
terrorist
attack
on
american
soil
would
involve
terrorism
that
intuitive
interpretation
of
involve
make
sense
of
every
enumerate
activity
and
plainly
do
not
reach
the
contract
here
the
cftc
instead
claim
it
can
ban
an
event
contract
if
trade
on
the
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
but
that
construction
violate
basic
interpretive
principle
it
attribute
disparate
meaning
to
a
single
statutory
term
it
render
the
other
list
activity
superfluous
it
upend
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
regulate
exchange
and
it
ultimately
flip
the
statute
default
rule
by
subject
all
event
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
second
even
if
the
commission
be
empower
to
ban
event
contract
trading
that
would
amount
to
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
trading
on
the
contract
here
would
not
election
be
not
game
so
trading
contract
on
they
be
not
game
nor
do
the
unlawful
activity
category
empower
state
to
ban
event
contract
through
their
gambling
statute
again
the
commission
broad
interpretation
of
these
term
would
swallow
both
the
rule
and
the
other
enumerate
exception
finally
even
if
the
congressional
control
contract
be
properly
subject
to
public
interest
scrutiny
the
cftc
analysis
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
the

and

owner

of
whom

and

the
evidence
that

even
that
test
on
the
other
side
of

the
commission
merely
offer
unfounded
and
implausible
speculation
about

integrity
as
if
the
congressional

contract

economic
exposure
to

outcome
rather
than

in

the

function

the
property
owner
could
buy

cover

be
entirely

reading
of
the

a

might
involve
an

even
if
it
be
not
strictly
base
on
that
activity
if
its

be
closely
tie
to
an

activity
for
instance
a
contract
on
whether
the
ukrainian
military
will
acquire
certain
munition
in
2024
might
be
say
to
involve
war
even
though
its
underlying
event
be
not
itself
an
act
of
war
a
contract
on
whether
a
certain
ceo
will
be
arrest
for
fraud
might
be
say
to
involve
unlawful
activity
even
though
the
arrest
be
not
itself
unlawful
in
other
word
congress
could
have
choose
the
term
involve
to
prevent
circumvention
through
contract
that
be
base
on
event
technically
distinct
from
but
still
closely
related
to
the

activity
the
intuition
that
involve
be
broad
than
some
alternative
therefore
do
not

dramatically
shift
