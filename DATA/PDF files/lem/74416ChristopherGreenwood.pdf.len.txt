the

it

a

as
well
there
be
no

to

that

somehow
not

this
indeed
the

be
well
aware
of

ability
to
enforce

additionally
it
be
not
clear
why
kalshi
ability
to
enforce
a
rule
be
appropriate
for
public
comment
how
be
a
member
of
the
public
suppose
to
have
information
on
kalshi
system
and
procedure
and
internal
process
for
compliance
it
would
seem
that
the
most
appropriate
party
to
address
this
question
to
be
kalshi
and
kalshi
note
that
surprisingly
and
incongruously
the
commission
have
never
ask
kalshi
this
question
3
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
whether
take
a
position
on
election

congressional

be
define

under

1
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offering
be
available
in
traditional
gaming
venue
such
as
casino
or
sport
book
no
the
commission
should
not
consider
this
in
determine
whether
a
contract
be
gaming
and
subject
to
the
special
rule
for
event
contract
for
four
reason
1
presence
on
an
illegal
exchange
casino
or
sportsbook
do
not
by
right
cause
relation
to
gaming
for
example
if
corn
future
become
widely
trade
in
casino
and
sport
book
that
would
not
change
the
nature
of
the
corn
future
contract
into
a
gaming
contract
the
converse
be
also
true
if
a
traditional
future
exchange
start
a
roulette
parlor
the
bet
in
the
parlor
would
still
be
game
2
what
be
offer
at
such
venue
change
over
time
for
example
if
we
use
this
nature
of
the
venue
determine
nature
of
the
product
standard
many
commodity
future
and
security
might
have
originally
be
consider
game
because
bucket
shop
trade
those
product
in
large
volume
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
century
they
may
have
continue
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
bucket
shop
prohibition
3
the
commission
prevent
congressional
control
contract
from
be
list
on
exchange
in
the
nadex
order
it
would
be
circular
to
use
the
fact
that
such
activity
have
persist
off
exchange
as
evidence
the
activity
be
game
for
example
if
the
commission
prohibit
oil
future
and
oil
future
trading
move
to
casino
that
would
not
suddenly
change
the
economic
nature
of
oil
future
4
the
commission
do
not
consider
the
venue
offer
for
example
bitcoin
contract
prior
to
the
listing
of
bitcoin
contract
on
dcms
if
the
commission
consider
this
inquiry
to
be
dispositive
that
something
be
game
those
contract
would
be
game
contract
because
of
their
large
presence
on
such
venue
however
even
if
the
commission
do
consider
venue
as
relevant
in
determine
whether
the
contract
involve
game
congressional
control
be
not
offer
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
and
be
not
available
in
casino
like
those
in
las
vegas

they
will
take
your
bet
on
the
election

vegas

bet
on
the
control
of
congress
be
accept
at
caesar
palace
or
the
bellagio
such
contract
be
only
currently
offer
on
some
overseas
bet
service
and
illegal
or
unregulated
venue
in
the
united
states
instead
of
consider
venue
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
subject
of
the
contract
involve
gaming
when
adjudicate
whether
a
contract
involve
gaming
per
kalshi
letter
on
the
special

should
the
commission
consider
take
a
position
on
election
or
congressional
control
be
define
as
game
under
state
or
federal
law
no
for
two
reason
first
because
per
the
special
rule
only
the
underlying
event
congressional
control
should
be
consider
in
determine
whether
the

the

not

to
as
state
or
the
federal
government
may
define
it
wager
or

which
they

this

legally
interstate

in

richard

write
in
his
comment
letter
a
major
misconception
that
still
prevail
among
the
public
be
the
equivalence
of
gambling
and
speculation
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
gambling
be
an
artificial
self
construct
risk
create
for
recreation
speculation
be
the
assumption
of
risk
that
already
exist
in
the
real
and
financial
market
the
recreational
risk
of
gambling
be
not
present
until
the
casino
or
racetrack
be
build
and
wager
be
accept
on
the
other
hand
risk
in
the
production
of
good
and
service
in
the
economy
be
real
and
will
exist
even
in
the
absence
of
future
market
the
same
can
be
say
for
equity
and
interest
rate
and
risk
it
seem
reasonable
to
conclude
the
risk
associate
with
policy
change
from
different
election
outcome
be
most
similar
to
the
latter
the
transfer
of
risk
by
hedger
would
be
real
and
the
assumption
of
that
risk
by
speculator
would
be
proper

so
any

that

would
be
preempt
the

also

even

still
preempt

law
per
the
cfma
ibid
it
could
not
follow
more
plainly
that
cftc
regulate
derivative
have
the
same
preemptive
effect
congress
have
repeatedly
recognize
that
future
and
other
derivative
contract
serve
economic
purpose
and
therefore
state
law
that
purport
to
prohibit
or
regulate
future
or
derivative
contract
include
gaming
law
do
not
violate
the
cea
and
be
preempt
all
of
this
show
that
congress
and
the
state
understand
that
there
be
a
critical
distinction
between
bet
and
legitimate
financial
activity
election
contract
that
be
design
for
hedge
on
a
financial
market
constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
consider
the
contract
as
involve
unlawful
activity
as
these
law
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to
contract
like
kalshi
a
key
purpose
of
the
cea
and
grant
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
future
be
to
authorize
and
promote
trading
of
future
contract
notwithstanding
state
law
that
might
purport
to
prohibit
they
as
gamble
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
be
relevant
be
if
the
activity
underlie
the
event
contract
violate
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evasion
in
that
case
congress
want
to
make
sure
that
a
future
contract
would
not
legitimize
that
activity
without
the
commission
consider
whether
trade
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
obviously
would
not
be
concern
about
legitimize
election
even
if
the
focus
come
to
legitimize
the
trading
on
election
as
part
of
the
ultimate
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
have
already
cross
that
bridge
by
long
permit
market
participant
to
trade
such
contract
pursuant
to
no
action
letter
award
to
unregulated
market
the
notion
that
allow
a
regulated
exchange
to
offer
the
contract
be
what
change
the
public
interest
analysis
be
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
bet
the
wire
act
be
irrelevant
here
it
apply
only
to
sport
bet
and
wager
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
address
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the
internet
it
carve
out
derivative
contract
both
on
exchange
and
over
the
counter
from
the
definition
of
bet
and
wager
thereby
plainly
recognize
that
derivative
contract
serve
economic
purpose
that
distinguish
they
from

congress

an

that

it

that
its

the

this
be

it

should
the

there
be

by

on

a

the

that

there
be
variation
in

a

with

have
no

by

it
can

and
because
a
contract
only
theoretically
be
use
for
hedging
be
not
contrary
to
the
public

it
should
not
be
miss
that
the

imply
in
the
last
part
of

question
some
minimum
require
amount
of

in

would
be
likely
to
have
unintended

if

this

and
thus

if

the

be
essential
to
encourage
the

of

the

either
that

the

hedge

via
a

assume
the
former
the
answer
be
yes
there
be
risk
that

as

by

and
in

there

on

of

these
risk
can

otherwise
hedge
by

as
discuss
early

in

risk
that
a
certain

could
pose
to

industry
can
be
discern
well
in
advance
of
knowledge
of
the
particular
policy
that
may
be
implement
by
that
congress
and
provide
just
as
valid
a
hedge
rationale
this
difference
result
from
the
time
horizon
between
the
election
cycle
and
the
implementation
of
a
new
congress
specific
legislative
agenda
or
its
potential
response
to
current
event
for
example
follow
the
election
of
republicans
into
congress
in
2016
many
publication
speculate
that
trade
policy
would
become
more
restrictive
however
it
be
not

if
this
would
come
in
the
form
of

if
so
on

international

more
another

contract

on
taxis
or
public
policy
would
not
have
be
very
helpful
however
the
risk
of
a
more
restrictive
policy
be
there
because
of
who
would
win
the

exactly
what
kalshi

allow

to

another
example
be
new

that
would

a

once
the

the

will
begin
to

participant
may

from

many

and

be

a
suite
of
a

and
thus
wish
to
hedge
the
many
different
change
in
risk
through
a

for
example
an
oil
company
may
wish
to
hedge
the
risk
that
a
new
democratic
government
will
come
into

because
that
government
could
not

only
kalshi
proposal
let
they
hedge
the
risk
they
actually
face
democratic
government
if
the
question
be
ask
instead
whether
market
participant
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedge
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instrument
the
answer
be
they
can
not
many
retail
and
small
business
market
participant
do
not
have
access
to
these
other
instrument
and
the
inherent
friction
and
transaction
cost
in
arrange
these
type
of
complex
proxy
play
be
prohibitive
it
seem
unlikely
that
the
commission
would
determine
it
in
the
public
interest
to
solely
rely
on
these
tool
that
be
inaccessible
to
many
of
the
market
participant
who
need
risk
management
tool
most
additionally
the
effectiveness
of
these
basket
and
combination
of
instrument
to
hedge
the
risk
from
political
control
be
considerably
less
than
a
contract
directly
on
political
control
importantly
the
question
imply
that
its
answer
matter
but
do
not
explain
why
it
would
a
reasonable
inference
be
that
the
commission
be
say
no
new
method
of
hedge
a
risk
should
be
permit
if
there
be
other
exist
method
of
hedge
that
risk
nowhere
in
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulation
be
there
such
a
standard
the
exchange
hop
this
be
not
the
commission
view
as
it
have
not
be
the
exchange
experience
when
engage
with
the
commission
on
prior
contract
for
example
should
the
commission
say
farmer
can
buy
crop
insurance
therefore
they
should
not
have
access
to
agricultural
future
product
furthermore
such
an
interpretation
would
be
highly
anti
competitive
such
an
interpretation
would
mean
that
if
one
firm
offer
a
contract
on
an
event
or
a
commodity
that
no
challenger
should
enter
the
market
with
a
similar
but
different
product
to
compete
with
it
in
fact
such
an
interpretation
would
consistently
punish
novel
or
innovative
product
in
many
case
it
be
possible
to
construct
a
hedge
use
exist
product
and
attempt
to
do
so
might
be
expensive
or
incur
excess
basis
risk
the
fact
that
election
risk
have
implication
for
other
asset
be
in
fact
much
of
the
justification
for
the
contract
hedge
utility
and
would
work
in
concert
with
such
asset
many
similar
and
compete
product
be
list
by
different
exchange
in
order
to
promote
a
vibrant
and
competitive
marketplace
for
hedger
this
be
also
an
important
component
of
the
contract
price
discovery
utility
discuss
in
a
later
question
such
an
interpretation
would
also
curtail
innovation
innovation
often
happen
through
iterate
on
already
successful
product
and
idea
as
in
the
early
example
the
existence
of
insurance
product
would
have
inhibit
the
creation
of
future
innovation
often
require

and
sometimes
flawed
product
in

for

when

suffer
when
the
government
limit
their
option
it
in
the
public
interest
for
such
innovation
to
occur
and
for
that
to
happen
the
commission
should
not
take
the
view
that
this
product
should
not

because
it
purportedly
can

in

the
hedge
benefit
be
obvious
since
I
no
long
employ
through
my
union
my
wife
no
long
have
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seem
that
republicans
be
likely
to
take
control
I
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premium
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
small
or
that
her

although
some

claim
election

be
predictable
enough
to
be
a

even
diminish
those
who

the

those

do
see

they
can
not

give
the

that
all
the
people
who
identify
how
they
would
use
the

for

manage

be
mistaken
or
deficient
in
their
ability
to
recognize
risk
and
potential
tool
to
manage
or
mitigate
that
risk
it
would
be
arbitrary
for
the

to
listen
only
to
those
who
assert
that
there
be
no

who
state
that
they
would

by

there
be
sufficient
impact
from

the

even
if

it

still
easily
pass

there
be
one
area
where
the
full

requirement
become
relevant
and
that
be
in

to
responsible
innovation
as
a
foray
into
quasi
new
territory
it
make
sense
that
the
exchange
have
certify
only
a
fully
collateralized
product
this
requirement
will
prevent
excessive
leveraging
and
while
it
certainly
may
be
appropriate
to
have
margin
product
on
this
in
the
future
as
an
initial

it
be
prudent
and
sensible
to
maintain
kalshi

that

indeed
kalshi
should

there

it

to
determine
whether

a

be
appropriate
for

not
the

if
the

be
a
poor
fit
for

need
which
it
do
not
appear
to
be
especially
give
the
many
public

by
retail
small
business
and

in

then
kalshi
will
attract

in

will
amend
the

to
improve
the

of
the

and
hedger
be
align
substitute
the

judgment
for
the

would
short
circuit
that
valuable
process
accordingly
the
commission
inquiry
into
hedging
as
part
of
its
public

inquiry
should
be
whether
the
contract
can
be
use
for
hedging
as
note
however
the
contract
here
have
significant
hedging
utility
that
would
pass
any
of
these
test
moreover
different
firm
have
different
hedging
need
and
different
structure
can
well
meet
those
need
what
work
for
one
firm
may
not
work
well
for
another
firm
as
a
result
the
commission
should
not
attempt
to
speculate
about
whether
a
particular
structure
would
work
as
they
may
miss
many
firm
for
whom
an
alternative
structure
be
well
the
utility
of
the
market
be
that
there
exist
a
profit
incentive
to
create
product
for
even
niche
group
of
buyer
and
insofar
as
private
firm
be
far
close

base
than
a

agency
which
do
not

with
they
on

unlike
an

it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
for
the
commission
to
impose
its
judgment
about
whether
a

meet

need
it

they

we
be

this

suggest
many
current
concern
about

in

be
not
able

one
may
also
imagine
that

may
conspire
to
manipulate

to
give
the
false

of

thus
potentially

this
concern
have
be
test
several
time
by

who
have
conclude
that
all
attempt
at

have
fail
koleman
and
strumpf
in
a

paper
examine

american
political

market
and
find
that
no
previous
effort
at

be
capable
of
sustain
anything
more
than
fleeting

movement
they
write
we
find
little
evidence
that

can
be

moreover
the

thus
even
more
prone
to

than
a
fully

like
a

as
a
result
manipulation
on

be
even

indeed
as
george

ryan

find
one
major
reason
why

however

the

the
reasoning
roughly
track
as
follow
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
conflate
their
belief
as
preference
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
be
definitely
go
to
win
the
2024
presidential
election
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenge
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odd
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
be
at
stake
people
express
belief
as
mere
signal
lend
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
be
at
stake
they
be
able
to
differentiate
their
belief
from
their
preference
in
other
word
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrink
and
individual
who
trade
on
election
market
become
more
attune
to
fact
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
in
conclusion
the
contract
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
it
strongly
support
the
public
interest
as
demonstrate
by
the
evidence
above
the
contract
will
improve
asset

provide

management
opportunity
enhance

integrity

of

organize
to
suit
this
question
1
the
contract
will
not
harm
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of

integrity
it
be
important
for
the
commission
to
engage
with
the
evidence
on
election
integrity
rather
than
speculate
the
nadex
order
suggestion
that
voter
could
be
incentivize
to
switch
their
vote
and
thus
harm
election
integrity
be
outright
speculative
in

and
have
since
be
disproven
by

success
without
any
claim
of
let
alone
proof
of

drive
by
those

base
political

what
experience
we
have
with

suggest
cftc
really
do
have
anything
substantial
to
worry
about
in
allow

if
anything
they
heighten
voter
engagement
the

chief
executive
of

even
feature
on

give
the

market
price
and
for
that
brief
period
whenever
blowhard
partisan
insist
that
some
outcome
be
go
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on
the
event
and
ask
they
why
they
think
that
price
be
wrong
and
whether
they
actually
put
their
money
where
their

be
it
be
a
remarkable

ipredict

they

the

I
be

they

similar

not

exist

chance

to
flatter
the

of
their

second
pundit
may
want
to
directly
contradict
a
so
call
mainstream
line
about
a
candidate
win
in
order
to
gin
up
controversy
and
draw
more
click

viewership
as
a
result
they
may
claim

the

favorite
and
to
further
court
controversy
and

claim
that

the
contrary

a
function
of
fraud
and
deception
third
even
when

attempt
to

honest
viewer
themselves
may
seek
out
information
that

their

the

roughly
track
as
follow
when

people
conflate
their

a

liberal
may
say
that
a

be
definitely
go
to
win
the

presidential

a
belief
when
in

they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the

a
preference
however
that

individual
when
challenge
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odd
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
be

people
express
belief
as
mere
signal
lend
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
be
at

they
be
able
to
differentiate
their
belief
from
their
preference
in
other
word
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrink
and
individual
who
trade
on
election
market
become
more
attune
to
fact
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
empower
researcher
and
policymaker
one
of
the
most
exciting
application
of

event
contract
be
their
ability
to
provide
powerful
new
causal
inference
tool
to
researcher
and
policymaker
right
now
estimate
the
effect
of

be
rather
difficult
one
can
not
merely
compare
economic
outcome
during

likewise

problem
include
that

be
close

and
that
the

have
already

of
the
eventual
victor

enter
political

if

a
80
percent
chance
of

and
then
when
they
actually
win
on

night
a
stock
go
up

we
can
say
that
the
total

of
the

5

point
if
go
from
80
to
100
be
1
then
go
from
0
to
100
be
roughly
5
but
it
can
get
even
strong
since
researcher
would
now
have
a
time
series
of
how
the
probability
change
over

they
can
use

wish
as
discuss
at

early
in
this

and
in
kalshi
original
filing
american
election
be
not
readily
susceptible
to

in
fact
manipulation
of

control
the

have
never
occur
this
be
in
contrast
to
exist
market
that
the
cftc
regulate
indeed
the
cftc
have
bring
numerous
enforcement
action
against
market
participant
who
either
manipulate
or
attempt
to
manipulate
market
in
oil
precious
metal
cattle
and
other
commodity
spot
and
future
market
the
commission
regularly
bring
almost
a
hundred
enforcement
action
per
year
and
order
billion
in
monetary
relief
then
of
course
there
be
digital
asset
market
where
the
commission
have
bring
dozen
of
action
in
an
incredibly
short
time
contrast
that
with
election
where
election
or
voter
fraud
be
extremely
rare
and
never
succeed
at
flip
the
outcome
of

party
control
congress
even
in

where

manipulation
have
be
attempt
it
have
only
succeed
in

extremely
small
local

any
attempt
to

the

would
most
certainly
involve
a
high
degree
of
speculation
the

be
in
regard
to
the
sum
of

it
be
not
even
possible
to

the
close
and
thus
easy

even
if
some

machine
themselves
be
equally
quixotic
take
all
in

it

very
unlikely
that

considerably
less

than
in

area
that
fall
under

critically
there
be
already
enormous
stake
in

create
incentive
for

manipulation
this

will
not
change
that
fact
as
discuss
in

in

in

to
anyone

the

what

there

20
should
and
if
so
how
would
the

entity
list
the

take
step
to

possible
manipulative
false

activity
involve
the

information
for
the

while
the
contract
be
trade
the
exchange
have
already
take
great
step
to
prevent
and
address
manipulative
behavior
as
in
some
of
the
prior
question
it
seem
odd
for
the
commission
to
request
only
the
public
input
in
this
regard
but
have
not
discuss
this
with
kalshi
regardless
the
exchange
have
numerous
safeguard
in
place
to
prevent
manipulation
additionally
the
exchange
note
that
in
particular
concern
regard
manipulate
this
contract
be
broadly
unlikely
the
market
for
credible
information
on

and
their
probability
be
very
competitive
and
false

be
equally
as
likely
to

the

nonetheless
be
extremely

make
sure
that
such

would
not

for

it

this
be
no
different
it
be
also
important
to
note
what
the
correct
legal
standard
be
which
be
not
free
from
attempt
manipulation
indeed
one
need
only
to
peruse
the
annal
of
the
cftc
enforcement
action
to
find
many
contract
that

manipulate
libor
or
the
subject
of
an
attempt

these
event
contract
such
as
oil
contract
interest
rate
swap
etc
be
significantly
more
likely
and
susceptible
to
be
manipulate
than
this
contract
indeed
the
fact
that
a
contract
like
this
on
a
regulated
market
be
so
unlikely
to
be
manipulate
successfully
be
one
of
the
reason
that
the
public
be
so
keen
on
see
the

from
the

which
will
be
far
more
reliable
than
many

21
do
kalshi

affect
the

be
highly
unlikely
to
be
material
regard
the
outcome
of
in
total
several
hundred
congressional
race
it
be
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
argument
that
congressional
control
can
come
down
to
the
outcome
of
a
handful
of
race
and
some
race
can
be
decide
by
a
margin
of
several
thousand
hundred
or
even
individual
vote
have
little
to
no
bearing
on
the
contract
susceptibility
to
manipulation
the
margin
of
victory
before
an
election
be
unknown
if
a
nefarious
actor
attempt
to
manipulate
the
election
in
order
to
manipulate
the
contract
which
be
what
the
cftc
be
ask
in
this
question
the
actor
would
not
know
beforehand
what
the
margin
of
victory
would
be
that
nefarious
actor
would
have
to
assess
the
size
of
the
electorate
which
be
in
every
instance
go
to
be
large
accordingly
it
be
hard
to
conceive
of
the
definitive
piece
of
material
non
public
information
that
will
swing
the
outcome
of
the
contract
however
like
all
contract
on
kalshi
there
be
a
prohibition
to
trade
on
material
nonpublic
information
this
contract
be
no
different
in
that
regard
in
response
to
various
indication
from
the
commission
however
the
exchange
adopt
contract
specific
rule
for
this
contract
to
gate
out
certain
people
who
would
be
more
likely
to
have
information
that
could
be
consider
material
nonpublic
information
this
gate
itself
be
the
proverbial
safeguard
on
a
safeguard
as
in
other
question
kalshi
note
the
incongruity
of
ask
the
public
for
input
on
how
kalshi
will
enforce
a
rule
without
having
ask
kalshi
regardless
this
rule
be
enforceable
22
should
the
commission
be
responsible
for
surveille
and
enforce
against
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involve
the
price
form
information
for
the
contract
while
the
contract
be
trade
it
should
be
responsible
for
surveille
and
enforce
against
manipulative
and
false
reporting
activity
while
the
contract
be
live
as
much
as
it
be
responsible
for
do
so
with
other
list
contract
no
more
no
less
furth
the
exchange
note
that
one
of
the
benefit
of
have
this
activity
on
a
regulated
exchange
be
that
the
commission
will
for
the
first
time
gain
insight
into
the
amount
and
level
of
activity
of
trading
on
congressional
control
currently
if
for
example
congress
would
invite
the
cftc
to
the
hill
and
ask
the
cftc
to
describe
the
current
financial
activity
on
congressional
control
the
cftc
will
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
there
be
activity
some
on
otc
some
on
unregulated
market
some
overseas
when
press
for
detail
on
who
be
participate
the
cftc
will
have
to
confess
its
utter
ignorance
however
if
the
contract
be
to
trade
on
regulate
exchange
the
cftc
will
not
only
know
precisely
what
position
be
be
take
on
the
regulated
market
they
will
know
who
be
take
they
23
could
trade
in
the
market
for
the
contract
obligate
the
commission
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
if
so
be
this
an
appropriate
role
for
the
commission
there
be
no
reason
for
the
commission
to
believe
it
will
be
responsible
for
police
attempt
at
or
successful
election
fraud
no
more
and
no
less
than
the
cftc
be
responsible
for
any
other
type
of
underlie
fraud
that
have
impact
on
a
contract
early
this
year
there
be
two
individual
who
be
arrest
for
attempt
to
destroy
power
station
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
destroy
the
city
of
baltimore
if
successful
the
sabotage
would
have
impact
electricity
price
significantly
be
the
cftc
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
prosecution
of
these
two
individual
be
the
cftc
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
protecting
of
america
power
grid
impact
the
price
of
global
oil
include
the
future
market
that
the
cftc
regulate
be
the
cftc
therefore
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
meeting
be
the
cftc
obligate
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
determination
of
corporate
dividend
that
underlie
the
cme
contract
the
answer
to
all
of
these
be
that
the
cftc
will
get
involve
to
the
extent
that
it
be
necessary
for
it
to
administer
and
enforce
the
cea
the
cftc
do
not
in
any
of
these
case
assume
the
role
of
the
cop
on
the
beat
this
application
here
be
no
different
election
manipulation
be
a
crime
there
be
law
enforcement
agency
who
police
election
and
election
be
police
much
more
effectively
than
other
market
that
have
cftc
derivative
product
trade
on
they
the
commission
be
not
the
only
cop
on
the
beat
with
regard
to
election
fraud
election
unlike
many
other
reference
market
or
event
that
have
cftc
derivative
trade
on
they
be
govern
by
multiple
law
enforcement
agency
whose
very
existence
be
to
prevent
and
detect
election
manipulation
and
fraud
this
include
the
federal
election
commission
the
federal
department
of
justice
state
election
commission
state
secretary
of
state
and
state
ethic
commission
history
have
show
that
these
agency
be
very
good
at
their
job
the
other
day
the
cftc
bring
an
enforcement
charge
against
alexander
mashinsky
and
celsius
network
llc
where
the
cftc
acknowledge
the
role
that
be
play
by
both
the
sec
and
the
attorney
office
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
similarly
cody
easterday
commit
fraud
that
be
discover
by
tyson
food
and
prosecute
by
the
department
of
justice
the
cftc
also
charge
easterday
presumably
after
cooperate
with
the
relevant
criminal
authority
these
be
two
example
of
many
the
cftc
be
well
verse
in
cooperate
with
the
relevant
law
enforcement
agency
be
it
the
fbi
or
doj
or
any
other
relevant
federal
or
state
authority
there
be
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
cftc
would
somehow
lose
that
competency
in
this
case
24
what
other
factor
should
the
commission
consider
in
determine
whether
these
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
have
never
fully
define
the
full
extent
of
the
factor
it
consider
under
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
even
the
nadex
order
admit
that
the
commission
can
consider
factor
other
than
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
be
not
an
expert
in
all
area
such
as
election
law
or
integrity
voter
confidence
or
how
to
foster
democracy
and
the
commission
should
instead
focus
on
what
it
know
the
value
of
a
contract
as
a
hedge
interest
and
the
value
of
a
contract
price
to
market
participant
as
we
note
in
response
early
these
contract
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
have
a
large
economic
purpose
would
serve
as
a
useful
tool
for
voter
the
medium
and
the
public
that
would
fight
information
and
improve
election
integrity
we
note
that
the
evidence
support
the
contract
be
wholly
consistent
with
the
state
finding
and
purpose
of
the
cea
find
in
7
usc

the
contract
provide
a
means
for
manage
and
assume
price
risk
discover
price
or
disseminate
pricing
information
through
trading
in
liquid
fair
and
financially
secure
trading
facility
7
usc
these
contract
and
their
trading
on
kalshi
would
protect
all
market
participant
from
fraudulent
or
other
abusive
sale
practice
and
misuse
of
customer
asset
7
usc
finally
allow
these
contract
to
trade
on
a
cftc
regulate
dcm
would
promote
responsible
innovation
and
fair
competition
among
board
of
trade
other
market
and
market
participant
ibid
in
sum
these
contract
be
consistent
with
the
cea
and
its
purpose
and
kalshi
have
show
that
they
should
be
trade
on
a
cftc
regulate
exchange
with
all
of
the
protection
that
the
cea
make
available
to
market
participant
the
commission
should
hold
a
