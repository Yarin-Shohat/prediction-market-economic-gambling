I
be
an
economics
professor
at
the
university
of
chicago
in
my
opinion
the
commission
should
approve
this
contract
political
election
be
a
major
source
of
economic
risk
there
be
good
reason
to
expect
that
election
prediction
market
will
be
a
beneficial
tool
for
improve
hedging
and
efficiency
of
economic
decision
making
that
be
contingent
on
such
risk
exist
evidence
suggest
that
such
contract
have
perform
well
in
the
past
it
be
worthwhile
to
experiment
with
this
contract
and
to
expand
the
use
of
such
contract
in
the
event
that
this
experiment
have
a
positive
outcome
important
insight
into
these
issue
be
provide

do
these

involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
describe
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of

in

an
activity
that
be
similar
to
gaming
as
describe
in

section
of
the

it
be
not
appropriate
to
view
any
election
contract
as
gaming
gaming
involve
bet
on
outcome
that
be
intrinsically
enjoyable
but
have
no
economic
effect
such
as
sporting
event
election
have
far
reach
economic
effect
a
well
analogy
be
trade
on
future
contract
for
interest
rate
or
commodity
price
do
the
contract
serve
a
hedging
function
be
the
economic
consequence
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
base
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
example
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedge
directly
by
the
contract
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrate
the
hedge
utility
of
the
contract
these
type
of
contract
can
be
extremely
valuable
for
hedge
the
economic
effect
of
election
outcome
be
enormous
even
with
respect
to
local
election
but
certainly
for
national
election
this
imply
large
economic
uncertainty
and
risk
associate
with
election
election
prediction
market
can
be
a
valuable
tool
to
help
many
type
of
economic
agent
to
hedge
their
risk
even
if
the
market
or
transaction
size
be
too
small
for
direct
hedging
of
risk
prediction
market
hedge
risk
more
deeply
because
they
can
provide
more
accurate
real
time
prediction
of
the
likelihood
of
various
outcome
that
provide
well
information
which
can
be
use
to
improve
the
quality
of
decision
make
investment
etc
for
example
consider
a
firm
contemplate
a
large
capital
investment
with
value
contingent
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
well
quality
prediction
about
the
election
can
improve
the
timing
type
and
magnitude
of
investment
increase
economic
efficiency
be
there
unique
economic
risk
tie
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedge
via
derivative
product
on
equity
debt
interest
rate
tax
rate
asset
value
and
other
commodity
price
the
economic
risk
of
election
outcome
can
be
imperfectly
hedge
via
other
mean
currently
available
however
prediction
market
on
these
enormously
significant
event
can
greatly
improve
the
ability
to
hedge
directly
and
via
improve
economic
decision
making
as
describe
above
moreover
evidence
from
academic
research
suggest
that
these
type
of
contract
be
a
very
promising
tool
they
tend
to
outperform
other
method
polling
moreover
there
be
little
evidence
that
attempt
to
manipulate
such
market
succeed
these
point
be
discuss
in
wolfer
amp
zitzewitz
rhode
amp
strumpf
should
the
commission
consider
the
contract
design
and
payout
when
try
to
assess
the
economic
utility
of
the
contract
for
example
be
binary
contract
useful
for
hedge
nonbinary
economic
event
binary
contract
be
useful
and
have
the
virtue
of
simplicity
in
design
and
execution
however
the
commission
should
consider
future
application
with
non
binary
contract
that
include
market
with
multiple
possible
outcome
a
set
of
compete
presidential
candidate
but
also
index
and
