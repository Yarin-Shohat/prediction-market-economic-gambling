add
if

such

thus
the
cea
through
this
provision
establish
a
clear
framework
under
which
the
commission
can
but
be
not
obligate
to
review
an

that
be
base

a

determination
that

congress
grant
the

the
discretion
to

and
thereby
prohibit
only
when

of

congress
do
not
grant
the

the

on
an

that
involve
an
unenumerated
activity
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
contrary
to

this
lack
of
authority
include
the
sixth
enumerate
activity
other
similar
activity
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary

that

require
the

to

and
then
only
if
it
be
similar
to
one
of
the
other
specify
underlying

crime
terrorism

war
or

the
key
question
here
require
understand
the
limitation
on
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
be
the
scope
1
limit
to
contract
when
the

underlie
the

or
do
they

include
the
act
of
participate
in
the
contract
be
itself
apply
the
principle
of
statutory
and
regulatory
construction
show
that
section
and
rule
be
limit
to
only
the
underlie
activity
not
participate
in
the
contract
itself
and
because
kalshi
political
control
contract
do
not
match
any
of
the
enumerate
activity
which
the
statute
be
expressly
limit
to
those
contract
be
not
subject
to
the
statute
and
implement
regulation
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
there
be
several
term
that
be
key
to
understand
the
framework
that
congress
create
for
the
special
rule
that
appear
throughout
this
comment
and
be
helpful
to
define
here
event
contract
the
event
contract
event
the
contract
consider
as
a
whole
an
event
contract
be
a
contract
that
be
base
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
for
example
a
contract
whose
term
and
condition
specify
that
the
holder
of
the
contract
will
receive
payment
base
on
the

a

contract

be
the

the
phrase
contract
consider
as
a
whole
which
be
what
the
cftc
have
propose
to
be
the
sphere
of
its
inquiry
refer
to
a
broad
view
of
a
contract
and
all
factor
that
surround
the
contract
for
example
this
could
include
the
market
activity
of
buy
and
sell
the
contract
the
information
embed
in
the
contract
pricing
and
in
the
case
of
an
event
contract
the
contract
event
general
background
on
the
cea
special
rule
under
the
cea
contract
listing
be
not
a
permission
regime
contract
do
not
need
commission
approval
to
be
list
and
although
the
cea
provide
a
mechanism
that
exchange
may
utilize
to
put
a
contract
before
the
commission
for
approval
whether
or
not
to
utilize
that
method
be
solely
in
an
exchange
discretion
this
process
be
set
forth
in
17
which
the
commission
title
voluntary
submission
of
new
product
for
commission
review
and
approval
indeed
the
overwhelmingly
vast
majority
of
contract
be
never
present
to
the
commission
for
approval
under
this
mechanism
even
in
those
rare
instance
when
the
commission
be
formally
present
with
a
contract
for
approval
the
commission
discretion
over
whether
to
grant
or
withhold
approval
be
limit
under
the

and
the
regulation
the
commission
must
approve
every
contract
that
do
not
violate
the

or
the
regulation

17
the
commission
be
not
grant
authority
to
conduct
a
be
this
a
contract
that
I
be
comfortable
with
analysis
and
the
commission
be
not
grant
authority
to
disapprove
a
contract
because
it
do
not
like
it
the
commission
be
also
not
grant
the
authority
to
prohibit
any
contract
on
the
ground
that
it
violate
the

there
be
one
exception
to
this
rule
where
congress
do
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
prohibit
a
contract
that
the

determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
be
clear
even
if
argunedo
the
special
rule
apply
to
the
contract
which
it
do
not
the
special
rule
would
still
not
prohibit
the
contract
because
it
be
in
the
public
interest
and
therefore
certainly
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
exception
be
the
special
rule
in
of
the

the

this
point
that

can
involve

once
an

contract
pass
step
two
the
analysis
move
to
step
three
of
the
special
rule
step
three
be
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
involve
an
activity
that
be
list
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
for
the
purpose
of
step
two
of
the
special
rule
an
event
contract
only
involve
an
activity
if
the
event
contract
event
involve
that
activity
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
in
step
four
be
different
from
step
three
the
analysis
in
step
four
consider
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
and
be
not
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
conversely
the
analysis
in
step
three
be
limit
to
what
activitie
the
event
contract
event
involve
for
example
an
event
contract
can
only
involve
war
if
the
event
contract
event
involve
war
conversely
if
the
event
contract
event
do
not
involve
war
then
the
event
contract
do
not
involve
war
similarly
an
event
contract
will
involve
game
only
if
the
event
contract
event
involve
game
for
the
purpose
of
step
three
it
be
irrelevant
if
something
else
surround
the
event
contract
such
as
the
market
activity
of
trade
the
contract
involve
a
list
activity
the
only
relevant
factor
for
step
three
be
whether
the
event
contract
event
involve
the
list
activity
not
whether
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
involve
the
list
activity
step
three
of
the
statute
apply
only
if
the
contract
event
be
an
enumerate
activity
there
be
many
reason
why
the
analysis
of
whether
an
event
contract
involve
a
list
activity
in
step
three
be
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
and
do
not
include
the
consideration
of
the

as

many
of
these
reason
be
state
in

in

of

technology
the
exchange
provide
two
reason
here
for
convenience
this
comment
refer
to
the
reading
that
the
analysis
under
step
three
include
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
and
be
not
limit
to
only
the
event
contract
event
as
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
be
wrong
an
event
contract
can
not
be
consider
to
involve
a
list
activity
base
on
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
and
not
only
the
event
contract
event
if
step
two
be
so
broad
it
would
1
not
provide
congress
intend
narrow
function
and
2
it
would
render
the
statute
internally
inconsistent
the
sixth
activity
illustrate
the
flaw
in
apply
step
three
broadly
congress
include
as
the
sixth
activity
a
similar
activity
to
the
first
five
activity
that
be
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
the
sixth
activity
mean
that
the
commission
can
determine
that
any
factor
that
be
part
of
an
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
this
be
because
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
step
three
be
not
limit
only
to
look
at
the
event
contract
event
the
analysis
in
step
three
look
at
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
accordingly
the
activity
include
in
the
list
in
step
three
be
not
confine
to
the
event
contract
event
and
can
include
anything
relevant
to
the
event
contract
for
example
the
commission
can
determine
that
trading
contract
on
a
certain
event
be
a
similar
activity
to
the
list
activity
and
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
contract
would
satisfy
step
three
even
though
the
event
contract
be
base
on
event
that
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
the
trading
on
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
per
the
commission
determination
and
trading
on
the
contract
be
part
of
the
contract
when
consider
as
a
whole
the
analysis
would
then
move
to
step
four
but
step
four
call
for
a
public
interest
analysis
of
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
where
it
have
already
be
determine
under
step
three
that
the
trading
itself
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
illustrate
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
what
congress
clearly
design
be
a
statute
that
allow
the
commission
to
apply
special
scrutiny
to
contract
base
on
particular
event
that
congress
identify
as
problematic
congress
do
not
shut
the
door
to
such
contract
but
recognize
that
trading
on
an
even
contract
base
on
a
problematic
activity
that
involve
say
assassination
or
terrorism
might
nevertheless
have
redeem
feature
such
as
hedge
utility
that
would
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
event
contract
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
this
way
congress
clearly
differentiate
the
event
contract
event
which
may
be
disfavor
and
trade
in
the
event
contract
permit
where
trading
on
the
disfavored
activity
offer
economic
and
other
societal
benefit
when
trade
in
the
event
contract
itself
be
include
in
the
analysis
at
step
three
the
distinction
congress
seek
to
draw
between
the
underlie
event
and
trading
in
the
contract
be
obliterate
this
defect
in
the
statute
that
emerge
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
from
the
sixth
activity
the
fact
that
the
defect
stem
from
the
sixth
activity
do
not
mean
that
defect
be
limit
to
the
sixth
activity
and
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
be
fine
with
regard
to
activity
one
through
five
that
would
misapprehend
the
way
that
statute
work
once
it
be
demonstrate
that
step
two
can
not
be
about
the
contract
consider
as
a
whole
for
even
one
activity
that
view
be
prove
wrong
therefore
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
be
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
regardless
of
the
activity
additionally
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
actually
render
all
of
the
first
five
activity
in
step
two
superfluous
once
a
contract
pass
step
three
no
matter
which
activity
the
contract
involve
it
must
pass
step
three
to
be
prohibit
by
the
special
rule
the
analysis
in
step
four
be
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
any
event
contract
that
the
commission
determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
step
three
necessarily
would
also
satisfy
the
sixth
activity
in
step
three
for
example
an
event
contract
that
involve
war
will
pass
step
three
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
will
then
move
to
step
four
and
assume
that
the
commission
find
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
that
point
the
event
contract
actually
involve
two
of
the
list
activity
I
it
involve
the
activity
of
war
and
ii
it
also
involve
an
activity
that
the
commission
have
determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
be
impossible
for
an
event
contract
to
pass
step
four
and
not
involve
the
sixth
activity
in
step
three
accordingly
there
be
no
point
in
the
first
five
activity
list
in
step
three
only
the
sixth
activity
in
fact
there
would
be
no
point
in
step
three
at
all
as
note
the
sixth
activity
in
step
three
and
step
four
be
identical
accordingly
if
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
be
correct
congress
would
have
just
skip
step
three
altogether
the
special
rule
would
have
be
a
simple
six
line
statute
that
say
only
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
exclude
commodity
that
be
base
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
level
of
a
commodity
describe
in
section
of
this
title
by
a
designate
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreement
contract
or
transaction
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
inevitable
collapse
of
all
of
the
step
three
activity
into
the
sixth
activity
and
the
collapse
of
the
sixth
activity
into
step
four
under
this
expansive
interpretation
of
step
three
show
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
be
wrong
the
correct
view
of
step
three
be
that
it
like
step
two
simply
describe
what
the
contract
be
base
on
and
the
analysis
in
step
three
be
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
accordingly
there
be
a
big
difference
between
step
three
include
the
sixth
activity
and
step
four
step
three
be
focus
only
on
the
event
contract
event
if
an
event
contract
pass
step
three
because
the
event
contract
event
involve
any
of
the
list
activity
even
the
sixth
activity
the
analysis
under
step
three
will
always
be
different
from
the
analysis
under
step
four
the
analysis
under
step
three
will
be
whether
the
event
contract
event
involve
the
activity
the
analysis
under
step
four
be
very
different
step
four
do
not
only
consider
the
event
contract
event
alone
it
consider
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
thus
all
of
the
anomaly
that
directly
stem
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
disappear
under
the
view
that
the
analysis
in
step
three
like
step
two
consider
only
the
event
contract
event
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute
be
that
the
analysis
in
step
three
like
step
two
be
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
step
two
and
three
work
in
concert
to
create
the
eligibility
requirement
for
the
type
of
contract
that
the
special
rule
apply
to
an
event
contract
whose
event
involve
a
list
activity
and
step
four
serf
as
an
independent
step
whose
analysis
consider
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
together
all
three
step
form
a
coherent
and
cohesive
statutory
rule
that
implement
congress
intent
to
have
the
commission
review
a
narrow
subset
of
event
contract
whose
underlie
event

activity
such
as
terrorism
and
assasination
congress
do
not
want
to
automatically
legitimize
via
future
and
swap

nevertheless
give
the
commission
discretion
to

one
straightforward
example
in

be
terrorism
assassination

the

the

be
unnecessary
the

determine

the

by

to
be

to

further

that
congress
intention
be
for
the
commission
to
analyze
the
activity
underlie
the
contract
rather
than
trade
in
the
contract
itself
this
final
enumerate
activity
provide
the
commission
a
sort
of
catchall
to
determine
whether
the
event
involve
similar
activity
to
the
precede
category
and
thus
might
be
inappropriate
for
list
since
terrorism
assassination
war
and
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
unquestionably
refer
to
the
occurrence
or
contingency
underlie
the

the
sixth
catch
all
category
must
be
read
consistently
with
the
rest
of
the
enumerate
list
apple
must
be
compare
to
apple
we
explain
below
why
notwithstanding
the
commission
nadex
order
the
gaming
provision
must
also
refer
to
the
underlie
activity
and
not
trade
in
the
contract
itself
another
reason
that
section
must
be
read
as
focus
on
the
underlie
activity
be
that
such
focus
be
congruent
with
the
nature
of
event
contract
themselves
if
congress
be
concern
about
trade
in
the
contract
itself
there
be
no
indication
why
it
would
have
limit
the
provision
to
event
contract
rather
than
establish
a
general
rule
that
would
have
authorize
the
commission
to
prohibit
any
derivative
contract
that
the
trading
in
be
for
example
unlawful
under
state
law
other
principle
of
statutory
construction
also
undercut
the
application
of
the
proposal
erroneous
construing
of
the
statute
under
the
commission
interpretation
a
person
trade
an
election
contract
for
example
be
engage
in
gaming
stake
something
of
value
upon
a
contest
of
other
by
parallel
reasoning
a
person
trade
a
terrorism
contract
be
engage
in
terrorism
and
a
person
trade
a
war
contract
be
engage
in
war
that
be
not
a
tenable
interpretation
of
the
statute
if
congress
intend
the
commission
to
focus
on
the
underlie
event
for
some
of
the
enumerate
category
but
to
focus
on
trading
in
the
contract
itself
for
other
it
would
have
say
so
it
certainly
can
not
be
presume
or
infer
from
silence
that
congress
intend
the
commission
to
apply
disparate
analytical
approach
to
the
single
list
of
enumerate
activity
when
the
correct
interpretation
of
section
be
apply
to
the
contract
the
result
be
clear
election
be
not
illegal
under
state
or
federal
law
be
not
game
and
be
not
similar
to
any
of
the
enumerate
activity
federal
or
state
crime
terrorism
assassination
war
and
gaming
of
which
be
activity
that
congress
do
not
want
to
legitimize
or
encourage
via
event
contract
without
careful
consideration
by
the
commission
the
commission
should
therefore
not
impede
kalshi
from
self
certify
the
contract
and
lack
a
legal
basis
to
invoke
section
to
do
so
additionally
the
proposal
not
only
contravene
the
language
and
structure
of
section
but
also
threaten
to
upend
the
cea
itself
virtually
every
future
or
swap
contract
can
be
describe
as
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
some
future
event
this
overly
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
gaming
would
threaten
to
render
other
enumerate
provision
superfluous
give
that
as
explain
above
virtually
all
event
contract
could
potentially
qualify
for
that
categorization
as
the
supreme

have
repeatedly
observe
there
be
a

all
of
these
various

illustrate
the
flaw
in

whether

constitute

or
whether

be

instead
to
maintain
the
structural

of

and
the

the

must
evaluate
whether
a

involve
an
underlie

that
be
one
of
the
enumerate
category
of

in

it
be
important
here
to
note
that
the
above
fact
be
clear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
even
without
chevron
demise
the
proposal
resort
to
legislative
history
would
be
incorrect
the
current

demonstrate
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
be
contrary
to
the
proposal
by
use
the
word
relate
to
or
reference
in
addition
to
involve
the
current
regulation
only
reinforce
that
the
relevant
activity
be
the
underlie

not
trade
on
the
underlying

it
would
not
make
sense
for
a
future

to

trading
in
the
contract
to
the
contrary
the
word
reference
be
a
clear
direction
to
focus
on
the
underlying

that
the
contract
reference
thus
under
the
current
regulation
like
the
statute
the
relevant
activity
for
purpose
of
the
commission
event
contract
analysis
be
the
activity
on
which
the
contract
be
base
or
to
which
the
contract
refer
rather
than
the
contract
itself
because
the
contract
be
not

on
an
enumerate

the
commission
do
not
need
to
consider
undertake
a

analysis
if
the

be

otherwise
however
the

could
either
permit

the

authorize

determination
that

a

that

the

be
not
gamble
be
the
subject
of
the
trade
the
cftc
have
no
other
way
to
distinguish
between
gambling
and
derivative
trading
consider
this
if
the
cftc
do
have
a
way
to
distinguish
between
gambling
and
derivative
trade
then
the
proposal
to
consider
all
trading
on
certain
topic
gambling
would
make
very
little
practical
sense
it
would
mean
that
the
cftc
recognize
the
there
could
be
non
gamble
trading
on
these
contract
but
despite
that
the
cftc
will
consider
they
gamble
anyway
just
because
they
be
on
these
topic
that
not
only
make
little
practical
sense
it
be
certainly
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
that
the
cftc
point
to
throughout
its
proposal
in
short
the
cftc
proposal
mean
that
there
be
no
difference
between
the
gambler
and
the
future
trader
the
casino
and
the
exchange
other
than
the
type
of
bet
that
they
offer
accord
to
the
cftc
proposal
the
casino
offer
bet
on
blackjack
and
the
exchange
bet
on
beef
the
cftc
proposal
have
familiar
strain
this
time
from
a
different
piece
of
legislative
history
one
that
take
place
many
year
ago
and
predate
the
cftc
in
its
current
iteration
this
one
a
robust
conversation
that
take
place
on
the
floor
of
congress
between
then
representative
burdick
of
north
dakota
and
other
representative
and
record
in
the
congressional
record
chairman
on
the
first
day
of
this
session
I
introduce
in
the
house
a
resolution
for
the
appointment
of
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
subject
of
future
trading
it
be
know
as
house
resolution
25
and
it
have
be
refer
to
the
committee
on
rule
the
board
of
trade
lobbyist
that
infest
this
city
have
seek
in
every
possible
way
to
prevent
the
appointment
of
such
a
committee
and
the
holding
of
hearing
on
future
trading
thus
far
the
committee
on
rule
have
take
no
action
on
my
resolution
on
the
second
day
of
last
month
I
address
the
house
on
the
importance
of
an
investigation
such
as
be
call
for
in
house
resolution
25
I
make
mention
of
some
very
pertinent
I
not
only
charge
that
future
contract
be
gamble
contract
and
be
generally
recognize
by
the
court
as
such
but
I
also
charge
openly
on
the
floor
of
this
house
that
the
practice
of
future
trading
fix
a
low
ceiling
above
which
the
price
of
wheat
and
the
price
of
cotton
and
the
price
of
other
exportable
product
can
not
rise
try
as
we
may
to
enact
farm
legislation
in
behalf
of
agriculture
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
I
charge
openly
on
the
floor
of
this
house
that
our
farmer
in
the
united
states
be
today
as
much
subject
to
the
economic
domination
of
great
britain
as
they
be
in
colonial
day
before
the
revolutionary
war
I
charge
and
I
now
renew
the
charge
that
the
price
of
wheat
and
cotton
and
other
exportable
farm
product
be
dictate
from
england
and
that
due
to
the
operation
of
the
future
market
ticker
tape
american
price
be
low
than
price
pay
at
liverpool
which
be
a
buyer
world
market
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
I
make
other
charge
which
I
be
prepared
to
support
I
charge
openly
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
secretary
of
agriculture
wallace
condone
the
criminal
conduct
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
and
permit
his
underling
to
print
publish
and
distribute
false
propaganda
in
support
of
such
conduct
I
mention
one
of
several
instance
of
that
sort
I
mention
the
propaganda
article
of
irwin
a
commodity
exchange
administration
pay
roller
which
be
publish
in
the
june
1937
issue
of
the
illinois
law
review
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
I
charge
and
I
now
renew
the
charge
that
secretary
of
agriculture
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
have
condemn
the
favoritism
that
have
be
show
by
the
business
conduct
committee
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
in
favor
of
certain
trader
and
against
certain
other
trader
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
chairman
I
have
barely
begin
to
mention
the
charge
that
I
shall
in
due
time
level
against
secretary
wallace
the
commodity
exchange
administration
and
the
chicago
board
of
trade
the
commodity
exchange
act
be
not
be
enforce
as
the
congress
intend
it
to
be
enforce
secretary
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
be
equally
guilty
along
with
the
commodity
gambler
who
continue
under
the
protection
of
friendly
governmental
agent
to
rob
and
to
exploit
the
farmer
I
shall
be
more
specific
in
my
charge
the
commodity
exchange
act
by
its
express
term
and
provision
contemplate
that
the
future
contract
market
shall
be
market
for
the
future
delivery
of
commodity
today
the
wheat
future
market
for
example
be
more
of
a
gambler
market
and
less
of
a
market
for
future
delivery
than
it
be
yesterday
during
the
fiscal
year
end
june
30
1937
the
volume
of
delivery
under
wheat
future
contract
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade
be
only
fifteen
one
hundredth
of
1
percent
and
in
the
ensue
fiscal
year
the
volume
of
delivery
be
only
thirteen
one
hundredth
of
1
percent
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
I
charge
that
secretary
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
well
know
that
one
of
the
chief
reason
for
the
enactment
by
the
congress
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
be
to
eliminate
excessive
speculation
in
future
contract
market
have
condone
the
recent
action
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
in
reduce
margin
requirement
in
wheat
future
trading
from
4
cent
a
bushel
to
2
cent
a
bushel
with
the
obvious
intention
of
stimulate
speculation
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
I
charge
that
short
selling
be
rampant
in
all
future
tract
market
that
be
under
the
jurisdiction
of
secretary
wallace
and
of
the
commodity
exchange
administration
that
be
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
chairman
my
time
be
limited
today
I
shall
have
more
say
on
this
important
subject
in
the
near
future
however
before
I
take
my
seat
I
wish
to
go
on
record
with
another
very
serious
charge
against
secretary
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
I
refer
to
the
willful
violation
by
the
chicago
board
of
trade
of
one
of
the
most
fundamental
condition
impose
by
the
commodity
exchange
act
on
future
contract
market
this
willful
violation
have
be
under
the
protection
of
friendly
governmental
agent
who
be
responsible
to
secretary
wallace
the
chicago
board
of
trade
boast
that
it
be
the
large
grain
market
in
the
world
that
be
far
from
the
truth
it
be
a
big
gambling
institution
deal
extensively
in
lottery
ticket
on
price
fluctuation
but
it
handle
very
very
little
actual
grain
this
have
for
a
long
time
be
a
bone
of
bitter
contention
between
the
chicago
board
of
trade
on
the
one
hand
and
the
farmer
on
the
other
hand
yet
the
chicago
board
of
trade
will
not
furnish
any
figure
the
law
require
as
a
condition
precedent
to
designation
by
the
secretary
as
a
contract
market
that
such
market
shall
first
make
provision
for
I
write
duvel
chief
of
the
commodity
exchange
administration
on
february
13
ask
whether
the
secretary
of
agriculture
have
ever
complain
against
the
chicago
board
of
trade
for
failure
to
keep
record
and
to
make
report
of
cash
transaction
I
do
not
ask
duvel
as
to
record
and
report
of
future
transaction
I
ask
he
specifically
as
to
the
violation
of
the
act
for
failure
to
keep
record
and
to
make
report
of
cash
transaction
duvel
reply
date
february
17
1939
be
evasive
and
unresponsive
I
here
and
now
charge
that
duvel
chief
of
the
commodity
exchange
administration
be
protect
and
have
be
protect
the
chicago
board
of
trade
in
a
very
serious
violation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
in
this
particular
which
be
a
fundamental
condition
precedent
to
its
designation
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
a
contract
market
without
which
designation
it
would
not
be
entitle
under
the
law
to
do
business
at
all
and
I
charge
that
duvel
try
by
his
letter
of
february
17
tosuppress
the
information
I
ask
for
these
be
very
grave
charge
against
secretary
wallace
and
chief
duvel
they
be
too
grave
for
this
house
to
permit
they
to
pass
unchallenged
chairman
I
charge
openly
on
the
floor
of
this
house
that
wallace
in
condone
the
action
of
la
salle
street
contribute
to
rob
and
exploit
the
farmer
if
wallace
be
enforce
the
law
instead
of
condone
the
illegal
practice
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
he
would
be
clean
up
the
situation
so
that
no
investigation
would
be
necessary
chairman
the
honor
of
this
demand
that
the
light
of
day
be
shed
on
the
operation
of
these
future
trader
that
nullify
every
legislative
attempt
to
help
the
farmer
and
that
by
underground
mean
to
defeat
the
enactment
of
any
measure
that
would
be
of
constructive
aid
to
agriculture
I
have
here
a
report
from
chicago
yesterday
which
state
quiet
but
persistent
selling
of
wheat
prompt
by
low
quotation
abroad
cause
fresh
decline
of
as
much
as
one
half
cent
1n
value
here
today
poor
demand
from
import
country
with
shipment
of
exporter
and
wheat
stock
afloat
large
have
a
depressing
effect
on
price
at
liverpool
and
thus
indirectly
exert
pressure
on
the
chicago
market
if
you
do
not
believe
this
gambling
operation
have
any
effect
on
the
price
of
our
grain
listen
to
this
statement
from
chicago
john
macmillan
president
of
cargill
elevator
speak
the
position
take
by
the
board
of
trade
would
tend
to
depress
the
price
of
corn
receive
by
the
farmer
and
would
benefit
the
short
seller
in
the
chicago
corn
pit
the
only
way
short
can
fill
their
contract
be
by
bring
grain
to
the
chicago
market
but
when
they
have
sell
short
bushel
and
the
delivery
day
arrive
and
they
be
not
compel
to
go
on
the
cash
market
and
buy
for
the
purpose
of
delivery
you
see
there
be
only
one
side
to
that
market
and
that
be
the
sell
side
and
that
be
the
side
which
be
support
by
the
board
of
trade
in
chicago
and
support
by
the
administration
of
this
act
which
be
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
merce
under
the
authority
of
this
board
their
agent
have
publish
article
advise
the
american
people
it
would
be
much
well
for
we
if
we
would
legalize
these
transaction
bolle
chairman
will
the
gentleman
yield
burdick
I
yield
to
the
gentleman
from
wisconsin
bolle
be
it
not
the
truth
that
this
be
one
of
the
great
reason
for
the
depressed
price
of
grain
landis
I
notice
an
article
state
congressman
name
burdick
he
shoot
off
his
mouth
over
on
the
hill
he
get
it
off
his
chest
and
if
he
want
to
follow
these
hearing
he
can
follow
they
through
the
record
prepare
by
our
stenographer
here
be
it
a
fact
that
they
move
these
hearing
from
washington
to
chicago
burdick
that
be
true
now
there
be
a
lot
of
member
of
congress
some
of
they
sit
here
now
who
would
like
to
have
take
in
that
hearing
to
understand
what
the
situation
be
and
then
prepare
to
meet
it
by
legislation
but
the
gentleman
from
indiana
landisl
be
correct
that
statement
be
make
by
this
attorney
for
the
chicago
board
of
trade
on
february
2
and
he
say
that
now
if
I
want
to
find
out
what
that
committee
be
do
I
can
follow
the
record
as
they
shall
keep
they
by
their
stenographer
and
they
move
the
hearing
out
of
the
city
of
washington
and
move
they
to
the
sherman
hotel
in
chicago
and
that
be
where
the
hearing
be
take
place
now
however
you
see
one
of
they
have
be
injure
one
of
these
gambler
have
be
injure
himself
and
it
be
a
good
deal
like
revolution
the
common
people
of
the
world
never
start
a
revolution
in
the
history
of
time
revolution
be
only
generate
by
the
baron
when
they
injure
the
baron
they
will
have
a
revolution
but
the
common
people
never
have
one
now
we
be
injure
the
baron
in
these
proceeding
and
one
of
these
baron
himself
state
that
this
practice
of
protect
the
man
who
sell
without
protect
the
buyer
have
the
effect
of
depress
the
price
of
grain
now
what
difference
do
it
make
if
we
pass
the
cost
of
production
bill
all
the
difference
in
the
world
that
be
one
act
they
do
not
want
pass
by
this
congress
because
the
moment
you
do
that
you
put
they
out
of
commission
there
be
another
bill
they
do
not
want
pass
they
do
not
want
the
townsend
bill
pass
and
I
will
tell
you
why
they
do
not
as
I
point
out
to
this
house
a
week
ago
they
sell
so
many
bushel
of
paper
wheat
that
if
they
have
to
pay
2
cent
on
every
transaction
it
would
cost
they
5
to
carry
on
the
fictitious
sale
that
do
not
represent
the
sale
of
one
actual
bushel
they
will
fight
that
plan
and
they
will
fight
the
cost
of
production
plan
they
will
fight
anything
that
interfere
with
their
power
to
continue
gambling
transaction
in
these
board
of
trade
I
have
not
anything
against
any
individual
in
chicago
or
elsewhere
the
only
interest
I
have
in
it
be
the
thousand
of
farmer
in
my
own
state
and
the
thousand
in
other
state
who
can
not
meet
their
interest
payment
who
not
make
a
living
who
be
live
off
of
this
government
when
we
have
these
million
of
people
in
distress
in
america
it
seem
to
I
this
congress
should
be
willing
to
appoint
a
committee
to
find
out
whether
all
of
these
statement
I
be
make
be
true
or
false
information
will
never
hurt
anybody
but
the
fact
you
do
not
have
the
information
will
hurt
the
farmer
of
this
country
when
a
man
on
the
board
of
trade
can
sit
there
with
his
heel
on
a
mahogany
desk
and
make
more
money
out
of
a
bushel
of
wheat
by
gamble
in
it
than
a
farmer
in
north
dakota
or
elsewhere
in
this
country
can
make
by
dig
the
wheat
out
of
the
soil
it
seem
to
I
that
the
farmer
side
of
this
question
should
be
hear
in
this
congress
and
I
be
think
about
those
farmer
the
man
who
raise
corn
and
wheat
and
cotton
and
tobacco
I
know
how
poor
they
be
I
live
w1th
they
myself
and
I
know
they
be
so
poor
they
can
hardly
afford
to
raise
a
crop
there
be
no
one
who
can
raise
cotton
at
the
price
they
be
get
today
and
if
it
be
not
for
the
fact
that
these
man
who
own
the
land
have
a
sympathetic
feeling
for
the
man
who
till
it
there
would
be
much
more
suffering
in
the
south
than
there
be
today
many
many
thousand
of
the
man
who
produce
cotton
in
america
be
keep
from
abject
want
by
the
good
will
of
the
man
who
own
the
land
the
chairman
the
time
of
the
gentleman
from
north
dakota
have
expire
burdick
may
I
have
1
more
minute
gifford
on
the
bill
I
would
like
to
know
what
the
gentleman
think
of
the
bill
I
yield
the
gentleman
1
additional
minute
chairman
burdick
the
gentleman
insist
that
I
talk
on
the
gifford
no
I
do
not
insist
burdick
if
you
do
I
will
surely
give
it
to
you
gifford
no
I
do
not
burdick
the
only
thing
I
be
ask
of
this
congress
and
that
be
not
very
much
be
to
use
your
influence
if
you
have
any
do
not
think
I
to
have
a
committee
appoint
by
this
congress
to
investigate
this
gambling
institution
that
do
more
harm
and
cause
more
loss
to
the
american
farmer
every
year
than
anything

here
the

this
stirring
and
historically
informative
repartee
be
but
one
salvo
of
a
broad
attack
level
against
the
derivative
industry
over
the
past
100
or
so
year
of
course
the
accusation
focusse
on
the
issue
du
jour
but
they
be
all
variation
of
the
same
theme
that
derivative
contract
be
indistinguishable
from
gamble
the
proposal
decision
to
look
to
state
law
be
very
perplexing
for
many
reason
none
the
least
that
the
same
state
law
that
call
the
activity
enumerate
in
the
proposal
gambling
also
call
all
derivative
contract
gamble
this
certainly
seem
to
be
contrary
to
the
colloquy
which
be
explicit
in
the
two
senator
desire
to
keep
gamble
out
of
the
future
market
and
also
against
what
we
can
presume
be
congressional
intent
that
future
contract
be
not
all
gambling
of
course
many
future
contract
would
not
be
sweep
up
in
the
proposal
prohibition
but
that
only
because
they
be
not
event
contract
not
because
under
the
proposal
they
be
not
gamble
the
cftc
should
not
just
reject
the
proposal
it
should
repudiate
it
instead
the
cftc
should
recognize
the
point
that
we
begin
with
gambling
be
distinguish
from
derivative
trading
by
more
than
just
the

iii
the

the

the

of

which
be
what
the

be
refer
to
be

there
be
no
state

federal

that
make
election
illegal
there
be
also
no
state
or
federal
law
that
prohibit
election
or
voting
in

accordingly
political

would
not
fall
under

to
be
sure

state
do
prohibit

the

since

have
incorrectly
state
that

definition

be

to

of

in

as
a
justification
for

in
this

however
the

the

order
and
the

be
limit
to
the

not
the

the
interplay
between

highlight
the

with

if

as

category
of

upon

the

the

the
purpose

be
to

a
contrary
interpretation
would
lead
to
the
undesirable
result
that
if
one
state
prohibit
a
specific
kind
of
contract
then
the
commission
could
use
the
special
rule
to
ban
that
contract
in
all
state
under
the
proposal
reasoning
because
rule
prohibit
the
listing
of
contract
that
involve
game
law
like
these
would
prohibit
all
event
contract
for
example
event
contract
on
the
weather
and
various
economic
indicator
would
be
consider
risk
something
of
value
upon
a
future
contingent
event
not
under
one
control
or
influence
and
yet
not
only
be
these
event
contract
a
staple
of
cftc
regulate
dcms
but
the
commission
core
principle
require
that
event
contract
be
specifically
outside
the
control
or
influence
of
a
market
participant
and
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
the
proposal
application
of
rule
would
therefore
preclude
the
cftc
from
regulate
any
event
contract
because
event
contract
be
consider
gamble
under
some
state
law
on
this
point
it
seem
that
at
the
very
least
rule
would
be
an
apa
violation
or
even
unconstitutional
if
the
analysis
in
proposal
be
take
to
its
logical
conclusion
congress
we
have
hold
do
not
alter
the
fundamental
detail
of

because

would

result
the
traditional

and
the
process
require
by

if

in

the

that

the

yet
the

clearly
continue

settle

even
though
it

the

be

which
be
all

that
be
unlawful
under

and
should
otherwise
fall
under
the
purview
of

rule
certainly
if
the
statute
be
give
the
same
broad
reading
that
the
commission
give
to
it
in
the
nadex
order
the
cannabis
equity
index
would
certainly
involve
an
enumerate
activity
and
be
subject
to
section
and
rule
yet
the
cannabis
index
contract
be
self
certify
and
the
commission
do
not
invoke

therefore
it
be
clear
that
the

have
not
maintain
the
nadex
order
overbroad
and
incorrect
reading
of
the

the

which
the

note
be

with

be
likewise
flawed
and
inconsistent
with

iv

specific
the
proposal
to
determine
up

that
all

be
contrary
to
the

be
contrary
to
the

as

above
congress
enact
a

that
give
the
cftc
authority
to
determine
that

congress
do
not
determine
that
all

be
contrary
to
the

in
fact
it
clearly
determine
that
a
contract
involve
an

activity
could
be
in
the
public
interest
which
directly
contradict
the
proposal
additionally
the
statutory
language
be
clear
that
the
determination
must
be
contract
specific
and
not
a
blanket
determination
as
note
in
the
discussion
of
step
one
above
the
special
rule
only
be
relevant
in
connection
with
a

if
congress
intend
for
the
cftc
to
make
a
blanket
rule
the
introductory
clause
to
the
statute
would
have
no
meaning
additionally
the
sixth
enumerate
event
also
demonstrate
that
congress
do
not
authorize
the
cftc
to
make
a
blanket
prohibition
as
detail
above
if
every
contract
that
involve
a
n
enumerate

be
contrary
to

that
would
render
the
commission
further
determination
which
be
require
under
the
statute
meaningless
public
interest
the
cftc
proposal
take
a
surprisingly
limited
view
of
the
power
of
its
market
to
manage
risk
in
the
course
of
its
prior
two
request
for
input
from
the
public
on
our
contract
the
cftc
have
hear
from
hundred
of
market
participant
from
individual
to
massive
international
corporation
how
they
assess
their
exposure
from
election
and
how
they
would
manage
that
exposure
and
the
cftc
reject
all
of
this
which
bring
up
a
fair
question
do
the
cftc
think
that
these
people
be
lie
be
the
cftc
official
position
that
these
commenter
be
lie
it
hard
to
know
because
the
cftc
utterly
and
inexplicably
fail
to
address
the
prior
comment
it
request
and
receive
in
its
proposal
certainly
some
of
the
commenter
on
the
prior
round
and
doubtless
some
of
the
commenter
to
this
proposal
speculate
that
no
one
will
use
the
contract
but
it
obvious
that
good
governance
principle
demand
that
little
to
no
weight
be
give
to
a
comment
that
speculate
about
how
someone
else
will
use
a
contract
relative
to
the
comment
from
that
very
someone
else
comment
inform
the
cftc
about
how
the
contract
will
be
use
be
much
more
grounded
in
fact
and
much
less
speculative
than
someone
guess
how
other
will
not
use
the
contract
this
point
be
obvious
when
the
two
camp
of
commenter
those
pro
event
contract
and
those
anti
event
contract
have
their
comment
strip
of
the
linguistic
peripheral
that
commenter
use
to
obfuscate
their
main
point
those
in
the
pro
event
contract
camp
say
this
we
identify
risk
and
we
will
event
contract
to
hedge
that
risk
those
in
the
anti
event
contract
camp
say
this
we
will
not
use
the
contract
to
hedge
risk
and
we
guess
because
there
be
no
way
for
we
to
actually
know
this
that
those
other
guy
be
go
to
use
the
contract
to
hedge
risk
distil
to
their
essence
it
seem
incredible
that
a
government
agency
that
pride
itself
on
be
datum
drive
and
ground
in
reality
would
give
any
weight
at
all
to
these
comment
from
the
anti
even
contract
camp
they
be
not
only
speculative
they
be
directly
contradict
by
the
information
that
the
cftc
have
ask
for
and
receive
from
the
public
the
same
be
true
with
regard
to
the
use
of
the
datum
from
the
contract
the
cftc
be
again
tell
by
a
broad
cross
section
of
the
marketplace
from
individual
to
large
multinational
corporation
even
people
within
the
government
itself
how
the
data
be
use
and
just
as
with
risk
management
the
cftc
ignore
this
traditional
use
of
the
market
one
that
would
certainly
satisfy
its
economic
purpose
test
and
should
also
weigh
much
strong
than
the
other
consideration
than
the
one
the
commission
focus
on
indeed
the
cftc
position
that
election
do
have
direct
impact
that
be
not
diffuse
be
very
hard
to
understand
there
be
huge
industry
that
have
direct
exposure
to
election
of
all
type
the
stock
market
react
to
change
in
the
poll
we
be
currently
in
a
hugely
important
election
cycle
be
it
at
all
credible
that
election
do
have
huge
economic
impact
if
so
why
do
they
dominate
not
just
the
regular
news
headline
but
the
business
news
headline
too
mainstream
medium
be
fill
with
headline
about
how
the
upcoming
presidential
election
will
impact
americans
the
wall
street
journal
the
new
york
times
the
washington
post
bloomberg
cbs
news
cnbc
news
yahoo
finance
fortune
and
the
street
be
just
a
handful
of
mainstream
outlet
that
have
recently
cover
how
a
potential
kamala
harris
or
donald
trump
presidency
might
impact
various
aspect
of
daily
life
include
investor
portfolio
the
stock
market
inflation
interest
rate
healthcare
retirement
saving
mortgage
rate
and
other
policy
area
from
the
medium
headline
it
be
clear
that
the
upcoming
presidential
election
be
expect
to
have
significant
effect
on
the
economy
and
personal
finance
of
everyday
americans
and
people
be
talk
about
how
they
can
mitigate
the
potential
impact
it
be
simply
wrong
to
assume
that
individual
and
business
both
small
and
large
be
not
impact
by
election
election
pose
broad
risk
many
of
which
can
not
be
easily
manage
by
other
contract
and
certainly
not
without
event
contract
the
premise
that
it
be
up
to
the
cftc
to
tell
the
market
how
to
assess
its
risk
and
then
how
to
manage
those
risk
and
how
to
ingest
information
and
what
to
do
with
that
information
be
simply
foreign
to
the
cftc
market
and
its
traditional
role
and
be
wrong
business
reasonably
assess
risk
on
the
basis
of
what
event
can
occur
that
will
impact
the
likelihood
of
another
event
occur
but
the
cftc
would
discount
those
risk
as
too
diffuse
to
be
manage
via
a
contract
that
also
be
simply
wrong
in
fact
the
cftc
regulation
make
numerous
mention
of
risk
management
that
registrant
must
perform
and
there
be
no
question
would
expect
registrant
to
be
able
to
see
several
step
down
the
road
and
how
one
event
can
impact
the
likelihood
or
risk
of
other
event
the
cftc
would
not
only
expect
registrant
to
identify
those
risk
they
would
expect
registrant
to
mitigate
those
risk
it
be
therefore
surprising
that
the
other
arm
of
the
cftc
seem
to
be
say
that
firm
be
limit
to
identify
and
manage
only
direct
risk
but
not
risk
that
involve
multiple
step
and
be
too
diffuse
and
just
as
a
firm
can
reasonably
identify
an
election
as
a
risk
that
can
be
manage
a
firm
can
reasonably
identify
an
election
as
a
key
component
that
will
impact
its
future
plan
the
cftc
seem
to
just
ignore
that
business
and
individual
make
probabilistic
decision
and
election
certainly
play
a
big
part
in
those
decision
accordingly
probabilistic
information
on
election
be
very
valuable
importantly
nothing
in
the
preamble
explain
why
the
cftc
ignore
the
comment
it
have
request
and
receive
and
ignore
the
importance
of
election
to
all
market
participant
the
cftc
also
fail
to
address
why
it
believe
that
election
contract
will
not
be
use
for
hedging
or
for
pricing
transaction
service
and
asset
on
more
than
an
infrequent
basis
additionally
the
cftc
ignore
actual
datum
that
market
participant
and
industry
use
prediction
market
datum
on
election
mainstream
medium
business
news
and
other
site
use
prediction
market
regularly
note
their
odd
as
an
important
source
of
datum
alongside
poll
for
one
example
out
of
many
from
august
8
2024
on
forbe
predictit
have
be
in
operation
for
a
decade
and
the
ream
of
evidence
of
the
importance
of
the
datum
that
be
generate
by
market
be
well
know
and
well
document
the
discussion
above
focus
on
election
contract
because
we
be
currently
in
the
midst
of
an
historic
election
to
maintain
that
election
do
not
pose
risk
that
can
be
hedge
and
election
market
will
not
produce
useful
datum
that
will
be
use
by
industry
be
more
than
arbitrary
and
capricious
but
these
truth
be
not
limit
only
to
election
all
event
contract
that
kalshi
have
list
have
strong
hedging
case
kalshi
incorporate
here
all
of
the
hedging
and
price
basing
analysis
that
it
share
previously
with
the
cftc
kalshi
do
not
duplicate
the
argument
here
because
the
argument
be
confidential
but
these
be
all
information
that
the
cftc
have
in
its
possession
should
have
consider
when
create
its
proposal
but
do
not
and
must
consider
and
address
prior
to
finalize
any
regulation
the
event
that
the
cftc
have
specifically
identify
be
tell
on
the
entire
proposal
event
like
oscar
grammy
the
nobel
prize
etc
all
have
huge
economic
impact
they
do
have
the
broad
impact
of
national
election
but
they
have
big
impact
on
the
community
that
be
involve
much
the
same
way
that
pork
belly
price
impact
those
who
care
but
while
the
proposal
be
fine
with
pork
belly
and
all
the
speculative
hedging
that
occur
on
those
contract
event
that
might
be
a
little
less
familiar
to
it
like
the
grammys
it
decide
just
do
not
have
enough
economic
impact
to
be
hedge
or
produce
useful
datum
never
mind
the
massive
creator
economy
and
the
importance
that
these
event
play
to
they
their
economic
risk
the
intense
research
that
social
medium
creator
do
be
apparently
accord
to
the
proposal
non
existent
there
be
of
course
another
interpretation
of
the
proposal
and
again
the
proposal
failure
to
adequately
explain
what
it
be
do
leave
a
lacuna
of
information
that
require
speculation
be
not
that
these
event
do
not
have
economic
impact
it
that
the
people
who
be
impact
will
not
manage
their
risk
and
will
not
use
market
datum
to
plan
their
business
how
the
cftc
would
know
this
be
not
clear
certainly
many
of
those
in
the
creator
economy
come
from
historically
underserved
community
who
traditionally
have
be
gate
out
of
access
financial
market
because
of
bias
and
discrimination
there
be
no
question
though
that
the
contract
that
be
target
by
the
proposal
be
those
that
be
most
relevant
to
historically
underserved
community
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
cftc
have
propose
to
miss
this
opportunity
to
cater
to
the
need
of
historically
underserve
community
the
cftc
should
encourage
its
regulated
market
that
be
serve
underserved
community
it
should
partner
with
exchange
to
educate
and
raise
awareness
of
the
benefit
of
regulated
market
it
should
celebrate
the
toppling
of
financial
barrier
it
should
celebrate
its
regulated
market
jettison
any
vestige
of
elitism
and
embrace
that
its
regulated
market
be
now
serve
the
need
of
those
whose
need
have
not
be
serve
by
market
instead
the
cftc
have
not
only
propose
to
prohibit
this
expansion
the
proposal
simply
dismiss
the
validity
of
these
economic
interest
it
could
have
be
hop
that
the
newfound
diversity
in
the
market
would
be
celebrate
vi
the
inclusion
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
the
proposal
fail
to
articulate
a
rationale
for
include
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affect
the
outcome
in
the
definition
of
game
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
base
on
the
state
law
definition
mention
above
do
not
include
this
additionally
the
cftc
do
not
provide
any
rationale
how
these
contract
be
not
in
the
public
interest
lump
the
outcome
of
the
super
bowl
with
the
number
of
viewer
of
the
super
bowl
be
incorrect
the
cftc
failure
to
articulate
any
rationale
for
this
proposal
and
the
public
interest
determination
violate
the
apa
vii
the
proposal
public
interest
determination
be
overbroad
the
proposal
will
ban
a
tremendous
variety
of
contract
the
cftc
public
interest
determination
fail
to
provide
a
rationale
for
all
but
a
small
number
of
contract
accordingly
the
proposal
violate
the
apa
the
cftc
be
require
to
provide
a
rationale
that
would
allow
the
public
to
know
why
each
contract
that
the
cftc
be
propose
to
ban
be
ban
viii
the
proposal
regard
exist
contract
the
cftc
proposal
will
harm
market
participant
by
require
the
contract
to
be
wind
down
to
be
clear
the
cftc
have
not
identify
any
harm
from
list
the
contract
not
a
single
harm
the
disproportionality
of
this
be
manifest
the
cftc
do
not
sufficiently
articulate
why
this
harm
to
market
participant
be
justify
nor
do
it
show
that
it
consider
alternative
this
proposal
be
ill
conceive
and
should
be
reconsider
the
failure
to
articulate
a
rationale
and
failure
to
consider
less
harmful
alternative
violate
the
apa
ix
anticompetitive
consideration
the
cftc
analysis
be
facially
flaw
the
cftc
state
that
they
find
that
this
proposal
will
have
no
anticompetitive
effect
that
be
so
patently
false
that
it
be
hard
to
understand
what
the
cftc
mean
the
first
step
this
analysis
would
take
be
to
identify
where
these
contract
be
available
the
answer
be
on
multiple
platform
they
be
available
on
kalshi
and
on
other
platform
that
be
not
regulate
by
the
cftc
the
proposal
will
ban
these
contract
on
kalshi
the
proposal
will
not
ban
these
contract
on
the
other
platform
to
be
clear
market
participant
today
have
a
choice
of
where
to
trade
kalshi
and
other
platform
the
cftc
proposal
will
prevent
kalshi
from
compete
with
these
other
exchange
it
be
hard
to
imagine
a
proposal
that
be
more
anticompetitive
than
this
the
cftc
proposal
on
this
be
again
beyond
arbitrary
and
capricious
sound
risk
management
the
cftc
proposal
state
that
the
commission
have
not
identify
any
effect
of
the
propose
amendment
on
sound
risk
management
practice
as
detail
above
event
contract
perhaps
especially
the
one
that
be
include
in
the
definition
of
gaming
provide
very
important
risk
management
tool
they
provide
hedging
tool
and
datum
that
be
use
for
risk
management
in
addition
these
be
tool
that
be
not
otherwise
available
to
many
participant
the
cftc
concussion
be
incorrect
and
unsupported
xi
price
discovery
the
cftc
state
that
while
the
propose
amendment
be
not
likely
to
have
an
impact
on
price
discovery
in
cftc
regulate
market
the
commission
acknowledge
that
certain
event
contract
could
have
limit
informational
value
in
other
context
outside
the
scope
of
cftc
regulate
market
that
may
be
lose
if
the
propose
amendment
be
adopt
as
detail
above
this
conclusion
be
flatly
contradict
by
reality
the
informational
value
be
extensive
and
broad
it
be
not
limit
at
all
xii
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
market
be
that
kalshi
be
the
only
exchange
that
offer
any
contract
that
would
be
affect
by
this
propose
rule
the
cftc
discussion
of
these
factor
as
it
regard
exist
exchange
be
limit
to
the
impact
that
it
will
have
on
kalshi
first
kalshi
note
that
the
cftc
do
not
engage
with
it
prior
to
make
this
proposal
it
receive
no
question
regard
the
impact
that
this
proposal
would
have
on
it
kalshi
be
therefore
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
the
cftc
base
this
section
of
the
proposal
on
this
fail
to
satisfy
