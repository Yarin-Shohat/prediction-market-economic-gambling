I
be
write
to
express
my
concern
regard
the
proposal
to
ban
election
contract
and
prediction
market
instead
of
an
outright
ban
I
believe
there
should
be
a
robust
regulatory
framework
to
ensure
these
market
operate
safely
and
transparently
within
the
united
states
ban
election
market
risk
push
this
valuable
activity
to
offshore
and
unregulated
platform
where
there
be
no
consumer
protection
or
oversight
this
could
lead
to
increase
risk
of
fraud
and
market
manipulation
undermine
the
very
integrity
the
ban
seek
to
protect
proper
regulation
can
address
potential
concern
while
preserve
the
benefit
these
market
offer
prediction
market
provide
valuable
insight
into
public
sentiment
and
can
serve
as
important
tool
for
hedge
against
political
risk
by
establish
clear
guideline
and
oversight
mechanism
the
cftc
can
ensure
that
these
market
contribute
positively
to
the
financial
ecosystem
I
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
and
focus
on
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
allow
election
market
to
operate
legally
and
effectively
this
approach
would
support
innovation
enhance
market
efficiency
and
protect
participant
ensure
that
the
remain
a
leader
in
financial
market
innovation
