dear
cftc
commissioner
I
be
write
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
cftc
recent
proposal
to
ban
election
contract
while
I
understand
the
importance
of
maintain
market
integrity
I
believe
this
proposal
overlook
the
essential
benefit
that
election
contract
offer
and
be
base
on
a
flawed
process
with
an
overly
broad
definition
of
gaming
I
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
approach
and
address
several
key
concern
regard
this
proposal
1
hedging
value
of
election
contract
election
contract
serve
a
critical
function
in
provide
hedge
opportunity
for
market
participant
political
event
particularly
election
introduce
significant
uncertainty
and
volatility
into
financial
market
business
and
investor
face
potential
adverse
impact
from
sudden
policy
shift
or
regulatory
change
result
from
election
election
contract
offer
a
mechanism
to
manage
this
uncertainty
effectively
for
example
multinational
corporation
operate
in
diverse
political
environment
can
use
these
contract
to
mitigate
risk
associate
with
policy
change
follow
election
investor
concern
about
market
volatility
due
to
electoral
outcome
also
benefit
from
the
ability
to
stabilize
their
portfolio
ban
these
contract
would
remove
a
valuable
tool
for
risk
management
and
could
lead
to
increase
market
instability
2
price
basing
value
forecast
and
datum
election
contract
also
provide
crucial
information
through
their
pricing
which
reflect
aggregate
market
expectation
and
sentiment
about
electoral
outcome
this
price
base
information
complement
traditional
opinion
poll
and
forecast
offer
a
more
dynamic
view
of
electoral
trend
the
transparency
and
predictive
value
of
election
market
enhance
the
robustness
of
political
forecast
provide
medium
analyst
and
policymaker
with
valuable
insight
by
ban
election
contract
the
cftc
risk
deprive
the
public
and
decision
maker
of
an
important
data
source
that
aid
in
more
accurate
forecasting
and
understanding
of
electoral
dynamic
3
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definition
the
process
lead
to
the
proposal
formulation
raise
significant
concern

appear
to
have
be
make
without
a
comprehensive
examination
of
the
empirical
evidence
regard
their
impact
and
utility
there
have
be
inadequate
engagement
with
stakeholder
who
rely
on
these
contract
for
legitimate
purpose
and
the
analysis
support
the
proposal
lack
depth
furthermore
the
definition
of
gaming
use
in
the
proposal
be
overly
broad
and
conflate
different
type
of
market
activity
this
broad
definition
undermine
a
nuanced
understanding
of
market
dynamic
and
fail
to
recognize
the
positive
role
that
election
contract
can
play
question
for
the
cftc
to
address
1
empirical
evidence
and
analysis

empirical
evidence

do
the
cftc
plan
to
incorporate
feedback

3
hedging
and
risk
management
how
do
the

assess
the

contract
have
play
a
crucial
role
in
risk
management
for
business

investor
what
alternative
mechanism
do
the
cftc
propose
for
market

currently
use

against
political
uncertainty
4
price
discovery
and
forecast

provide

enhance

how
do
the

propose
to
replace
or
supplement
the
predictive
value
offer
by
election
contract
if
they
be
ban
5
definition
of
gaming
can
the
cftc
clarify
the
specific
criterion
use
to
define
gaming
in
the
context
of
election
contract
how
do
this
definition
align
with
the
actual
activity
observe
in
these
market
how
do
the
cftc
differentiate
between
speculative
activity
that
be
consider
problematic
and
those
that
be
legitimate
and
beneficial
6
regulatory
impact
assessment

of
the
potential
economic
and
informational
impact
of
ban
election
contract
on
market
and
market

transparency

7
alternative
regulatory
approach
what

or
modification
have
the
cftc
consider
that
could
address
any
identify
risk
associate
with
election
contract
without
implement
a
complete
ban
be
the
cftc
open
to
explore

that
allow
for
the
continuation

under
strict
oversight
or

condition
8

its
proposal
to
ban
election
contract
these
contract
offer
essential
hedging
tool
provide
valuable
price
base
information
and
support
market
stability
the
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definition
use
in
the
proposal
detract
from
a
balanced
and
well
inform
regulatory
approach
a
more
nuanced
examination
of
the
role
and
impact
of
election
contract
combine
with
stakeholder
engagement
and
empirical
analysis
be
necessary
to
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
protect
market
integrity
while
allow
beneficial
market
activity
to
thrive
thank
you

consider
my
perspective

these
critical
question
