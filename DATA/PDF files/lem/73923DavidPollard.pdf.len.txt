appreciate
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
the
commission
propose
amendment
to
part
40
of
the
cftc
regulation
as
set
forth
in
the
notice
of
propose

date
may

the
notice
ln
pertinent
part
the
notice
set
forth
several
question
that
relate
to
the
utility
of
contract
involve
gaming
and
ask
whether
a
blanket
prohibition
of
such
contract
be
warrant
as
a
longstanding
market
maker
of
exchange
trade
derivative
instrument
we
believe
that
the
type
of
contract
that
the
notice
now
define
as
gaming
can
provide
business
legitimate
hedge
opportunity
and
that
the
public
interest
would
be
very
much
serve
by
allow
for
a
regulated
market
to
trade
they
upon
therefore
for
the
reason
set
forth
below
we
strongly
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
position
and
the
propose
ban
of
all
gaming
contract
as
an
initial
matter
the
notice
ask
for
public
comment
regard
the
cftc
newly
propose
definition
of
gaming
as
the
staking
or
risk
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
I
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
other
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involve
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitor
in
one
or
more
contest
or
game
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contest
or
game
while
we
defer
to
the
comment
submit
by
licensed
sportsbook
and
legal
expert
as
to
what
should
be
consider
game
sig
would
note
that
the
cftc
propose
definition
appear
to
be
overly
broad
si
g
understanding
of
the
cftc
note
be
use
interchangeably
with
the
term
gambling
bet
or
wagering
have
always
be
that
it
involve
an
activity
wherein
a
person
take
on
financial
risk
wholly
unrelated
to
any
other
business
activity
as
such
if
a
trader
risk
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
other
in
the
interest
of
hedge
a
legitimate
business
risk
that
trade
should
not
be
prohibit
as
a
de
facto
bet
or
wager
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
the
unrevised
cftc
rule
while
the
notice
concede
that
the
propose
definition
of
gaming
would
prohibit
some
legitimate
hedge
activity
for
entity
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
outcome
the
notice
downplay
this
inclusion
by
find
that
these
contract
generally
can
not
be
reasonably
expect
to
be
use
for
hedge
price
base
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
sig
respectfully
disagree
with
this
conclusion
for
example
contract
that
relate
to
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
event
the
winner
of
a
national
football
league
game
could
help
manage
the
financial
risk
and
variance
inherent
to
sport
book
operator
whose
business
be
inextricably
tie
to
predict
the
outcome
of
certain
game
or
contest
they
can
and
do
face
significant
financial
risk
in
their
operation
if
their
retail
customer
heavily
favor
one
side
of
an
event
in
that
instance
operator
be
force
to
either
change
the
price
of
the
event
to
an
undesirable
amount
to
discourage
additional
participation
or
to
stop
accept
wager
on
the
event
entirely
if
the
cftc
be
to
allow
for
a
regulated
derivative
market
offer
contract
relate
to
the
outcome
of
an
event
however
the
sportsbook
that
have
reach
its
risk
limit
would
be
able
to
hedge
that
risk
to
the
market
at
an
efficient
price
balance
its
book
and
continue
accept
wager
from
retail
customer
in
a
regulated
environment
as
legalized
and
regulated
sport
betting
continue
to
grow
in
the
united
states
sportsbook
look
for
an
opportunity
to
hedge
legitimate
business
risk
to
a
sophisticated
counterparty
base
upon
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
contest
alone
would
occur
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
even
set
aside
license
sportsbook
the
notice
conclude
that
the
broad
universe
of
market
participant
be
most
likely
to
trade
such
contract
for
entertainment
purpose
only
this
finding
however
fail
to
appreciate
the
economic
ecosystem
center
around
american
sport
in
addition
to
sport
book
there
be
myriad
local
business
that
have
a
substantial
financial
interest
tie
to
the
outcome
of
these
contest
this
include
not
just
stadium
and
arena
owner
that
need
to
anticipate
staffing
need
in
their
venue
but
also
countless
hotel
restaurant
and
other
local
business
that
stand
to
generate
a
great
deal
of
revenue
if
their
local
sport
team
qualify
to
host
additional
playoff
game
or
have
a
particularly
successful
season
even
more
ancillary
business
such
as
parking
lot
operator
close
to
stadium
see
uncertain
spike
in
revenue
when
attendance
to
local
sporting
event
increase
or
for
each
additional
playoff
game
certainly
when
a
team
be
have
an
exciting
win
season
more
fan
will
attend
game
and
thereby
frequent
local
establishment
unfortunately
there
be
no
traditional
financial
tool
that
could
allow
these
business
to
hedge
the
uncertainty
of
a
team
win
a
game
or
playoff
series
unlike
a
retail
customer
entity
be
almost
universally
restrict
from
utilize
a
licensed
sportsbook
to
hedge
this
type
of
risk
if
however
these
contract
be
make
available
on
a
regulated
market
these
business
owner
like
a
farmer
use
a
list
future
to
hedge
a
crop
harvest
could
protect
against
the
downswing
in
revenue
if
a
local
team
season
be
to
end
unexpectedly
early
the
above
justification
for
permit
trading
of
at
least
some
regulated
gaming
contract
apply
with
even
great
force
to
those
contract
base
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
which
the
notice
would
now
expressly
consider
gaming
in
propose
cftc
rule
while
sig
have
submit
multiple
comment
letter
address
this
exact
issue
file
as
public
comment
for
industry
filing
22
002
and
230
I
we
would
still
take
this
opportunity
to
reiterate
our
view
that
contract
regard
the
outcome
of
political
election
serve
a
vital
purpose
in
allow
investor
to
hedge
against
unwanted
risk
create
by
election
in
a
manner
closely
resemble
commonly
use
financial
product
as
previously
explain
market
participant
already
adjust
their
trading
strategy
in
response
to
electoral
outcome
as
different
government
have
substantially
different
policy
while
there
be
some
uncertainty
regard
the
exact
manifestation
of
specific
policy
election
contract
allow
a
market
participant
e
and
the
market
as
a
whole
to
forecast
the
implication
associate
with
one
candidate
agenda
and
then
react
to
the
possible
outcome
of
an
election
in
this
manner
the
directional
effect
of
a
give
government
certainly
to
direct
and
quantifiable
change
in
the
price
of
commodity
and
other
financial
asset
or
instrument
for
example
one
candidate
may
be
more
likely
than
another
to
impose
strict
environmental
regulation
that
would
raise
operational
cost
and
associated
price
in
certain
energy
industry
by
trade
election
outcome
contract
business
could
alleviate
the
risk
of
increase
energy
cost
by
trade
a
contract
with
a
party
more
willing
to
bear
that
risk
moreover
our
experience
over
decade
in
the
financial
industry
suggest
that
traditional
instrument
be
insufficient
to
fully
hedge
the
risk
that
arise
from
these
fluctuation
in
government
policy
many
product
do
not
have
future
market
associate
with
they
as
a
result
market
participant
that
face
idiosyncratic
policy
risk
be
force
to
use
imperfect
exchange
trade
product
that
do
not
fully
reduce
their
unwanted
risk
this
void
in
option
leave
many
business
and
investor
expose
to
unmitigated
risk
regulate
election
contract
on
the
other
hand
could
be
use
to
efficiently
hedge
business
risk
in
the
same
manner
as
other
successfully
list
hedge
product
just
as
a
financial
institution
use
list
future
to
hedge
a
portfolio
of
investment
product
another
business
apply
the
same
general
risk
management
goal
could
hedge
a
candidate
prospective
tax
hike
use
regulated
election
contract
lastly
the
notice
pose
several
concern
with
respect
to
election
integrity
specifically
the
notice
speculate
that
permit
trading
on
these
contract
could
raise
unique
additional
public
interest
concern
relate
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
while
many
other
commentator
have
weigh
in
regard
the
social
significance
of
these
contract
hedge
utility
and
their
resistance
to
manipulation
sig
would
just
emphasize
that
vast
amount
of
we
election
relate
trading
already
occur
in
the
status
quo
and
to
date
have
not
cause
any
integrity
relate
concern
this
fact
should
not
only
highlight
the
clear
demand
that
exist
for
these
product
but
also
underscore
that
bring
this
activity
to
the
onshore
regulate
and
tax
market
could
significantly
alleviate
that
concern
even
if
the
cftc
do
not
wish
to
find
itself
investigate
the
outcome
of
an
election
allow
for
an
onshore
trading
environment
would
give
those
agency
that
be
task
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
law
such
as
the
federal
election
commission
more
information
to
do
their
job
while
also
provide
market
protection
for
the
many
that
could
avail
themselves
of
these
hedging
tool
in
conclusion
sig
strongly
recommend
that
the
cftc
reconsider
its
position
on
a
prohibition
of
gaming
contract
there
be
numerous
type
of
contract
that
would
fall
under
the
cftc
broad
definition
that
could
provide
an
active
competitive
hedge
market
to
the
benefit
of
a
multitude
of
stakeholder
permit
even
some
of
these
contract
such
as
those
discuss
above
would
serve
as
an
invaluable
financial
tool
that
even
institutional
investor
may
use
to
balance
otherwise
unchecked
risk
