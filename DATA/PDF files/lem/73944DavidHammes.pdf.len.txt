learning
and
teaching
tool
for
I
when
I

as
a
professor
of
economic

the

predictit
be
approach
its
10
year
anniversary
make
it
one
of
the
big
and
long
running
prediction
market
in
american
history
3
for
people
who
do
know
predictit
work
by
draw
in
thousand
of
individual
who
buy
share
of
a
contract
such
as
will
donald
trump
win
the
2024
us
presidential
election
at
a
price
between
and
1
each
contract
will
resolve
for
either
0
or
1
the
number
of
cent
per
contract
the
current
price
reflect
the
probability
that
the
contract
will
resolve
as
yes
in
effect
this
be
a
crowdsourced
probabilistic
forecast
4
predictit
trade
be
cap
at
850
per
user
per
contract
this
help
to
keep
the
market
small
scale
and
ensure
that
wealthy
individual
can
not
manipulate
market
this
protect
the
sanctity
of
the
crowdsourcing
process
and
differentiate
predictit
from
other
financial
market
that
be
dominate
by
hedge
fund
and
institutional
investor
5
in
its
10
year
history
predictit
have
make
these
crowdsourced
probabilistic
forecast
available
to
the
public
and
make
anonymized
trade
datum
available
to
researcher
who
study
pattern
in
the
datum
6
research
show
that
these
forecast
be
generally
accurate
and
be
generally
more
accurate
than
polling
especially
early
in
a
race
this
be
because
poll
be
a
snapshot
in
time
but
prediction
market
allow
user
to
weigh
the
effect
of
factor
the
criminal
conviction
of
a
presidential
candidate
for
example
that
have
not
yet
fully
resonate
with
voter
7
because
of
its
accuracy
predictit
datum
be
widely
cite
by
medium
campaign
and
financial
institution
and
even
appear
on
the
bloomberg
terminal
8
the
research
also
show
that
predictit
make
user
more
likely
to
seek
out
factual
information
about
current
event
user
who
build
trading
strategy
around
factual
event
tend
to
do
well
than
those
who
trade
base
on
their
ideology
or
misinformation
one
study
find
that
a
prediction
market
relate
to
climate
reduce
participant
skepticism
of
climate
change
in
an
era
where
both
liberal
and
conservative
commentator
be
alarmed
at
the
public
acceptance
of
fake
news
and
misinformation
these
market
be
one
of
the
few
mechanism
leave
for
incentivize
the
accumulation
of
true
and
accurate
information
an
antidote
to
fake
news
9
despite
the
inherent
public
good
that
these
market
offer
the
cftc
be
currently
on
the
warpath
against
prediction
market
the
cftc
be
both
aim
to
shut
down
predictit
and
have
repeatedly
be
stop
by
court
include
the
second
high
court
in
the
land
and
be
propose
a
rule
that
would
ban
election
market
in
the
united
states
perhaps
permanently
10
predictit
be
spearhead
an
effort
to
tell
the
cftc
why
these
market
be
important
and
why
the
cftc
be
wrong
to
view
they
as
gamble
akin
to
sport
bet
or
a
spin
of
the
roulette
wheel
we
know
that
predictit
trader
invest
time
and
research
into
make
informed
opinion
about
some
of
the
most
economically
impactful
event
election
of
their
life
these
be
not
game
and
the
cftc
attempt
to
brand
they
as
gaming
be
wrong
we
need
your
help
to
submit
comment
and
force
the
cftc
to
rethink
this
proposal
please
cease
your
activity
against
and
similar
informational
site
sincerely
