prepare
these
comment
of
cei
research
associate
ari

under
the
propose
rule
the
commodity

cftc
would
among
other
sweeping
action
ban
event
contract
that
allow
americans

cei
believe
that
such
an
action

rule
would
be
contrary
to
the
interest
of
entrepreneur
investor
and
an
informed
electorate
of
voter
collectively
the
public
interest
and
that
the
cftc
furthermore
lack
authority
from

to
implement
such
a
rule
accordingly
the
rule
should
be
withdraw

the
cftc
make
the
threestep
argument
that

and
therefore
contract

involve

chair

and

may
have
sincere
conviction
against

but
without
the
explicit
authorization
of

the
cftc
can
not
simply
implement
a
rule
base
on
the
conviction
no

how
sincerely
hold
that
a
private

activity
be
immoral
or
even
corrupting
to

so
bypass
the

elect

would
be
fundamentally
undemocratic
the
cftc
should
also
note
that
since
it

the

have
change
significantly
the

that
largely
defer

it
admonish

to
be
skeptical
of

not

the

cei
believe
this

be
fundamentally
flawed
because
it

that

the
