in

analyse
however
the

note
here
that
the

can
not
exceed
the
authority
in

this
be
axiomatically
true
even
under
the
chevron
deference
from

indeed
step
one
of
chevron
be
to
determine
whether
congress
express
intent
in
the
statute
and
if
so
whether
or
not
the
statute
intent
be
ambiguous
it
be
black
letter
law
that
if
the
statute
be
clear
the
regulate
agency
can
not
regulate
contrary
to
the

indeed
early
this

in

hold
that

accordingly
the
commission
may
find
that
the
event
contract
have
hedge
utility
other
economic
utility
or
benefit
and
thus
could
not
determine
that
the
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
point
that
a
contract
event
can
involve
an
activity
list
in
the
statute
and
still
be
allow
because
the
contract
itself
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
be
make
by
then
commissioner
berkovitz
in
his
statement
on
erisx
rsbix
contracts
commissioner
berkovitz
statement
be
available
here
commissioner
berkovitz
conclude
his
statement
by
note
that
if
sporting
event
contract
with
an
economic
purpose
such
as
hedging
be
allow
to
be
trade
on
a
dcm
the
general
public
must
be
able
to
access
and
trade
those
contract
on
the
exchange
the
public
can
not
be
bar
from
trade
a
contract
list
on
a
dcm
however
game
contract
without
any
economic
purpose
should
not
be
permit
on
a
dcm
a
further
look
at
step
two
of
the
special
rule
once
an
event
contract
pass
step
one
the
analysis
move
to
step
two
of
the
special
rule
step
two
be
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
involve
an
activity
that
be
list
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
for
the
purpose
of
step
two
of
the
special
rule
an
event
contract
only
involve
an
activity
if
the
event
contract
event
involve
that
activity
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
in
step
three
be
different
from
step
two
the
analysis
in
step
three
consider
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
and
be
not
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
conversely
the
analysis
in
step
two
be
limit
to
what
activitie
the
event
contract
event
involve
for
example
an
event
contract
can
only
involve
war
if
the
event
contract
event
involve
war
conversely
if
the
event
contract
event
do
not
involve
war
then
the
event
contract
do
not
involve
war
similarly
an
event
contract
will
involve
game
only
if
the
event
contract
event
involve
game
for
the
purpose
of
step
two
it
be
irrelevant
if
something
else
surround
the
event
contract
such
as
the
market
activity
of
trade
the
contract
involve
a
list
activity
the
only
relevant
factor
for
step
two
be
whether
the
event
contract
event
involve
the
list
activity
not
whether
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
involve
the
list
activity
there
be
many
reason
why
the
analysis
of
whether
an
event
contract
involve
a
list
activity
in
step
two
be
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
and
do
not
include
the
consideration
of
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
many
of
these
reason
be
state
in
the
letter
in
part
2
of
this
comment
as
well
as
by
other
commenter

cohen
jeremy
weinstein
and
railbird
technology
the
exchange
provide
two
reason
here
for
convenience
this
comment
refer
to
the
incorrect
reading
that
the
analysis
under
step
two
include
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
and
be
not
limit
to
only
the
event
contract
event
as
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
wrong
an
event
contract
can
not
be
consider
to
involve
a
list
activity
base
on
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
and
not
only
the
event
contract
event
if
step
two
be
so
broad
it
would
1
defeat
congress
intend
narrow
function
and
2
render
the
statute
internally
inconsistent
the
sixth
activity
illustrate
the
flaw
in
apply
step
two
broadly
ie
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
congress
include
as
the
sixth
activity
a
similar
activity
to
the
first
five
activity
that
be
determine
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
the
sixth
activity
mean
that
the
commission
can
determine
that
any
factor
that
be
part
of
an
event
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
be
because
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
step
two
be
not
limit
only
to
look
at
the
event
contract
event
the
analysis
in
step
two
look
at
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
accordingly
the
activity
include
in
the
list
in
step
two
be
not
confine
to
the
event
contract
event
and
can
include
anything
relate
to
the
event
contract
for
example
the
commission
can
determine
that
trading
contract
on
a
certain
event
be
a
similar
activity
to
the
list
activity
and
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
contract
would
satisfy
step
two
even
though
the
event
contract
be
base
on
event
that
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
the
trading
on
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
per
the
commission
determination
and
trading
on
the
contract
be
part
of
the
contract
when
consider
as
a
whole
the
analysis
would
then
move
to
step
three
but
step
three
call
for
a
public
interest
analysis
of
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
where
it
have
already
be
determine
under
step
two
that
the
trading
itself
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
result
in
two
consecutive
step
that
do
the
exact
same
thing
step
two
the
commission
determine
that
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
step
three
the
commission
determine
that
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
again
this
illustrate
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
what
congress
clearly
design
be
a
statute
that
allow
the
commission
to
apply
special
scrutiny
to
contract
base
on
particular
event
that
congress
identify
as
problematic
congress
do
not
shut
the
door
to
such
contract
but
recognize
that
trading
on
an
event
contract
whose
event
be
a
problematic
activity
that
involve
say
assassination
or
terrorism
might
neverthless
have
redeem
feature
such
as
hedge
utility
that
would
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
be
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
this
way
congress
clearly
differentiate
the
event
contract
event
which
may
be
disfavor
and
trade
in
the
event
contract
permit
where
trading
on
the
disfavored
activity
offer
economic
and
other
societal
benefit
when
trade
in
the
event
contract
itself
be
include
in
the
analysis
at
step
two
the
distinction
congress
seek
to
draw
between
the
underlie
event
and
trading
in
the
contract
be
obliterate
this
defect
in
the
statute
that
emerge
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
from
the
sixth
activity
the
fact
that
the
defect
stem
from
the
sixth
activity
do
not
mean
that
defect
be
limit
to
the
sixth
activity
and
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
fine
with
regard
to
activity
one
through
five
that
would
misapprehend
the
way
that
statute
work
once
it
be
demonstrate
that
step
two
can
not
be
about
the
contract
consider
as
a
whole
for
even
one
activity
that
view
be
prove
wrong
therefore
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
regardless
of
the
activity
additionally
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
actually
render
all
of
the
first
five
activity
in
step
two
superfluous
once
a
contract
pass
step
two
no
matter
which
activity
the
contract
involve
it
must
pass
step
three
to
be
prohibit
by
the
special
rule
the
analysis
in
step
three
be
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
any
event
contract
that
the
commission
determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
step
three
necessarily
would
also
satisfy
the
sixth
activity
in
step
two
for
example
an
event
contract
that
involve
war
will
pass
step
two
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
will
then
move
to
step
three
and
assume
that
the
commission
find
that
the
contract
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
that
point
the
event
contract
actually
involve
two
of
the
list
activity
I
it
involve
the
activity
of
war
and
ii
it
also
involve
an
activity
that
the
commission
have
determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
be
impossible
for
an
event
contract
to
pass
step
three
and
not
involve
the
sixth
activity
in
step
two
accordingly
there
be
no
point
in
the
first
five
activity
list
in
step
two
only
the
sixth
activity
in
fact
there
would
be
no
point
in
step
two
at
all
as
note
the
sixth
activity
in
step
two
and
step
three
be
identical
accordingly
if
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
correct
congress
would
have
just
skip
step
two
altogether
the
special
rule
would
have
be
a
simple
six
line
statute
that
say
only
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
exclude
commodity
that
be
base
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
level
of
a
commodity
describe
in
section
of
this
title
by
a
designate
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreement
contract
or
transaction
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
inevitable
collapse
of
all
of
the
step
two
activity
into
the
sixth
activity
and
the
collapse
of
the
sixth
activity
into
step
three
under
this
expansive
interpretation
of
step
two
show
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
be
wrong
the
correct
view
of
step
two
be
that
it
like
step
one
simply
describe
what
the
contract
be
base
on
and
the
analysis
in
step
two
be
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
accordingly
there
be
a
big
difference
between
step
two
include
the
sixth
activity
and
step
three
step
two
be
focus
only
on
the
event
contract
event
if
an
event
contract
pass
step
two
because
the
event
contract
event
involve
any
of
the
list
activity
even
the
sixth
activity
the
analysis
under
step
two
will
always
be
different
from
the
analysis
under
step
three
the
analysis
under
step
two
will
be
whether
the
event
contract
event
involve
the
activity
the
analysis
under
step
three
be
very
different
step
three
do
not
only
consider
the
event
contract
event
alone
it
consider
the
event
contract
consider
as
a
whole
thus
all
of
the
anomaly
that
directly
stem
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
disappear
under
the
view
that
the
analysis
in
step
two
like
step
one
consider
only
the
event
contract
event
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute
be
that
the
analysis
in
step
two
like
step
one
be
limit
to
the
event
contract
event
step
one
and
two
work
in
concert
to
create
the
eligibility
requirement
for
the
type
of
contract
that
the
special
rule
apply
to
an
event
contract
whose
event
involve
a
list
activity
and
step
three
serf
as
an
independent
step
whose
analysis
consider
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
together
all
three
step
form

and
cohesive

these

the

the

the

even
though
the

do
not
because
the

therefore
those

this

that

and
should

reject
as
discuss
at
length
it
violate
the
structure
and
the
framework
of
the
statute
and
it
lead
to
absurd
result
the
correct
view
of
the
statute
be
that
step
two
like
step
one
relate
to
what
the
contract
be
base
on
or
the
contract
event
the
nadex
order
misreading
of
the
statute
would
apply
to
every
future
and
swap
contract
on
an
occurrence
the
consequence
of
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
that
the
nadex
order
adopt
be
that
the
special
rule
apply
to
all
future
commodity
option
and
swap
contract
that
be
base
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
the
nadex
order
find
that
the
contract
at
issue
there
be
gaming
because
the
act
of
trade
the
contract
would
fit
within
state
law
and
federal
law
definition
of
gaming
that
same
reasoning
would
apply
to
all
future
commodity
option
and
swap
that
be
base
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
because
the
act
of
trade
these
contract
would
also
fit
within
definition
of
gaming
for
example
the
nadex
order
cite
the
law
in
north
dakota
that
gambling
mean
risk
any
money
upon
the
happening
or
outcome
of
an
event
include
an
election
over
which
the
person
take
the
risk
have
no
control
nadex
order
fn

the
nadex
order
also
cite
the
new
hampshire
law
that
wager
mean
a
monetary
agreement
between
2
or
more
person
that
a
sum
of
money
shall
be
pay
to
one
of
they
on
the
happening
or
not
happen
of
an
uncertain
event
it
be
true
that
the
nadex
order
also
cite
state
law
that
be
more
tailor
to
election
specifically
but
that
do
not
negate
the
point
that
there
be
also
state
law
that
define
game
broadly
that
would
include
trade
any
future
commodity
option
or
swap
contract
that
pass
step
one
pick
and
choose
which
state
statute
to
consider
informative
in
a
manner
that
be
expedient
for
a
desire
outcome
be
not
the
proper
way
for
the
commission
to
adopt
its
definitional
framework
the
approach
the
commission
adopt
in
the
nadex
order
expand
the
scope
of
the
special
rule
far
beyond
what
congress
intend
under
the
nadex
order
and
in
light
of
the
breadth
of
some
definition
of
gaming
activity
the
commission
could
deem
the
staking
of
value
on
any
type
of
future
event
game
alternatively
the
commission
could
determine
via
the
authority
grant
in
the
sixth
activity
that
trading
on
any
type
of
future
event
be
similar
to
the
other
enumerate
activity
the
vast
breadth
of
such
discretion
can
not
be
square
with
the
specific
enumeration
of
activity
which
congress
clearly
design
to
cabin
the
special
rule
scope
this
reality
illustrate
the
nadex
order
flaw
in
go
beyond
the
event
underlie
the
contract
election
to
determine
whether
the
contract
be
game
this
argument
be
address
in
great
detail
in
part
2
of
this
comment
however
the
exchange
note
here
that
this
overbreadth
be
a
problem
exclusive
to
the
approach
to
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
adopt
in
the
nadex
order
under
the
more
tailored
approach
where
step
two
of
the
special
rule
be
limit
to
the
contract
event
this
overbreadth
disappear
apply
the
three
step
of
the
special
rule
to
kalshi

apply
the

step
to
kalshi
contract
show
that
the
contract
be
not
subject
to
the
special

kalshi

pass
step

it
be
a
contract
base
on
the
occurrence
of

control
the

requirement
in

proceed
to

two
step
two
be
whether
the

contract
event
involve
an

that
be
list
in
step
two
the
contract
event
be
political
control
specifically
the
dual
occurrence
of
the
party
membership
of
the
speaker
of
the

and
the

these
do
not
involve
any
of
the

activity
the
occurrence
of
political

do
not
involve
activity
that
be
illegal
under
either
federal
or

the

do
not
involve

the

do
not

the

do
not
involve

of

the
occurrence
of

do
not
involve
the

of

the

have
never
state
or
even
imply
that
the

the

however
the
commission
be
careful
to
not
suggest
that

themselves
the
very
bedrock
and
foundation
of
our
democracy
be
a
game
the

do
not
involve

that
the

have
determine

therefore
do
not
involve

that

include

in

of
the
special

and
therefore
the

fail
the

eligibility
requirement
the
analysis
therefore
terminate
and
do

even

this

provide
the

a

to

thus

since

with
the

of

apple

we

why
notwithstanding
the
commission
nadex
order
the
gaming
provision
must
also
refer
to
the
underlie
activity
and
not
trade
in
the

another
reason
that
section
must
be
read
as
focus
on
the
underlie

be
that
such
focus
be
congruent
with
the
nature
of
event
contract
themselves
if
congress
be
concern
about
trade
in
the
contract
itself
there
be
no
indication
why
it
would
have
limit
the
provision
to
event
contract
rather
than
establish
a
general
rule
that
would
have
authorize
the
commission
to
prohibit
any

that
the
trading
in
be
for

unlawful
under

in

the

do
not
interpret

instead
the
commission
appear
to
have
read
the
gaming
provision
the
fifth
enumerate
activity
to
refer
to
trading
in
the

itself
accordingly
the
commission
determine
that
the
gaming
provision
apply
to
nadex

because
the

a

the

interpretation
in
this
instance
run
counter
to
the
plain
language
and
structure
of
the
statute
as
explain
above
other
principle
of
statutory
construction
also
undercut
the
application
of
the

in
the

under
the

interpretation
a

a

and
a

contract

that
be
not
a
tenable
interpretation
of
the
statute
if
congress
intend
the
commission
to
focus
on
the
underlie
event
for
some
of
the
enumerate
category
but
to
focus
on
trading
in
the
contract
itself
for
other
it
would
have
say
so
it
certainly
can
not
be
presume
or
infer
from
silence
that
congress
intend
the
commission
to
apply
disparate
analytical
approach
to
the
single
list
of
enumerate
activity
when
the
correct
interpretation
of
section
be
apply
to
the
contract
the
result
be
clear
election
be
not
illegal
under
state
or
federal
law
be
not
game
and
be
not
similar
to
any
of
the
enumerate
activity
federal
or
state
crime
terrorism
assassination
war
and
game
all
of
which
be
activity
that
congress
do
not
want
to
legitimize
or
encourage
via
event
contract
without
careful
consideration
by
the
commission
the
commission
should
therefore
not
impede
kalshi
from
self
certify
the
contract
and
lack
a
legal
basis
to
invoke
section
to
do
so
while
we
could
stop
here
we
believe
it
be
worth
point
out
that
the
nadex
order
not
only
contravene
the
language
and
structure
of
section
but
also
threaten
to
upend
the
cea
itself
virtually
every
future
or
swap
contract
can
be
describe
as
stake
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
some
future
event
this
overly
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
gaming
would
threaten
to
render
other
enumerate
provision
superfluous
give
that
as
explain
above
virtually
all
event
contract
could
potentially
qualify
for
that
categorization
as
the
supreme
court
have
repeatedly
observe
there
be
a
canon
against

any

manner

in

do

instead
to
maintain

structural

of

and
the

the

should
evaluate
whether

election
that

the

should
not

of

ii
cftc

call
for
the
same
result
a
determination
that
section
do
not
present
an
obstacle
to
kalshi
self

of
the
contract
should
be
dispositive
because
cftc
regulation
which
the
cftc
adopt
to
implement
section
should
likewise
be
read
to
allow
only
for
the
commission
consideration
of
the
contract
underlie
activity
rather
than
its
consideration
of
trading
in
the
contract
itself
while
the
language
of
the
rule
be
not
identical
to
the
statute
there
be
no
reason
to
read
the
language
of
cftc
regulation
to
require
an
analysis
of
trading
in
the
contract
rather
than
the
contract
underlie
activity
that
constitute
the
event
the
scope
of
cftc
regulation
should
not
be
read
to
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
special
rule
in
the
statute
by
use
the
word
relate
to
or
reference
in
addition
to
involve
the
regulation
only
reinforce
that
the
relevant
activity
be
the
underlie
event
not
trade
on
the
underlying
event
it
would
not
make
sense
for
a
future
contract
or
swap
to
reference
trading
in
the
contract
to
the
contrary
the
word
reference
be
a
clear
direction
to
focus
on
the
underlying
event
that
the
contract
reference
thus
under
the
regulation
like
the
statute
the
relevant
activity
for
purpose
of
the
commission
event
contract
analysis
be
the
activity
on
which
the
contract
be
base
or
to
which
the
contract
refer
rather
than
the

itself
because
the

be
not
base
on
an

activity
the
commission
do
not
need
to
consider
undertake
a

analysis
if
the

be

otherwise
however
the
commission
could
either
permit
the

the

authorize
prohibition
only
upon
a

determination
that
the

would
be
contrary
to

a
determination
that
the

may
undertake

conduct

cftc

should
not

I

the

I
will
then
apply

and
describe
how
the

conclusion
to
the

be
incorrect
background
principle
of
interpretation
since
the

the

the
circumstance

the

I
first

then
use

go
on
to

that

the

one
straightforward
example
in

event
two

be
terrorism
assassination

the
inclusion
of

clearly
demonstrate
that

include

the

an
act
of

assassination

to
illustrate
this
point
consider

on
whether
a
foreign
leader
will
be
assassinate
how
many
russian
plane
will
be
shoot
down

how

will
occur

city
over

time
period
section
and
rule
would
apply
to
these
hypothetical
contract
because
the
activity
underlie
the
contract
in
these
hypothetical
example
be
the
enumerate
activity
of
assassination
war
and
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
federal

the
purchasing
of

itself
however
be
not
an
activity
of
assassination
war
or
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
federal

the
same
analytical
approach
by
extension
should
apply
to
each
of
the
item
on

include
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under
any
federal
or

otherwise

would
be
internally
inconsistent
contrary
to
the

second
section

and
provide
an

why

none
of

short

specifically
address
the
question
about
whether

only
to
the

or
the
trading
of

as
well
so
it
have
nothing
to
add

this
analysis
provide

as
to
whether
congress
intend
the

to
limit
the
scope
of

to
instance
where
the
underlie

of
an

be

of

this
reading
of

be
consistent
with
the

by

rule
borrow
heavily
from
the

the

also
use
the

involve
which
appear
in

but
also
add
the
phrase
relate

when
describe

because
involve
be
the
only
statutory
authority
provide
by
congress
the

can
not

the

of

thus
the
only
way
to
read
relate

consistent
with

be
that
they
be
the
specific

of

that

can
not
exceed
the

of

any
interpretation
of

that
view
it

the

would

the

in
turn
clearly

upon

it
would
be
nonsensical
to
interpret
relate
to

reference
as
describe
the
act
of
participate
in
the
event
contract
itself
to
be
clear
congress
could
certainly
promulgate
a
law
that
cover
the
participation
in
an
event
contract
but
section
be
not
that
law
instead
apply
the
traditional
tool
of
construction
congress
enact
section
to
prohibit
a
narrow
group
of
contract
whose
underlie
activity
be
the
enumerate
activity
and
the
cftc
have
determine
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
those
limitation
apply
to
rule
if
the
underlie
activity
of
a
contract
be
not
an
enumerate
event
it
be
outside
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
the
nadex
order
incorrectly
interpret
and
apply
section
and
rule
to
apply
to
political

contract
like
kalshi
as
describe
above
section
and
rule
apply
only
to
the

they
do
not
apply

whose

this
key
distinction
between
the

or
a

on
the

be
of
particular
importance
for
the
kalshi

here
the

the

contrary

the

expand

to

second

incorrectly
include

the

incorrectly
expand
the
scope
of

to
include
the

of

and
not
just
the

the
first
enumerate

of

under

federal

the
underlie

of

be
political

of
the

there
be
no
federal
or

that
make
political

illegal
there
be
also
no
federal
or
state
law
that
prohibit

or

in

which
result
in
the

of

accordingly
political

however
the

the

other

indeed
if

there
would
have
be
no
need
for

to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contract
upon
which
the
commission
could
make

the
fact
that

separate

be
a
clear
indication
that
congress
do
not
intend
for
all

the

result
that

then
the

could
use

reasoning
because

prohibit

like
these
would
prohibit

would
be
consider

something

not

and
yet
not
only
be
these

but
the

core
principle
require
that
event

be
specifically
outside

of
a
market
participant
and
not
readily
susceptible

the
nadex

application
of

would
therefore
preclude

from

any

because
event

be
consider

under

on
this
point
it
seem
that

would
be

if
the
analysis

the

of
company
in
the
cannabis

that
produce
and
distribute
cannabis
for
consumption
an
activity
that
be
unlawful
under

law
and
many
state
law
the

definition
of

commodity
namely
the

of
the

the

of

be
production
and
distribution
of
cannabis
for
consumption
which
be
all
activity
that
be
unlawful
under

many
state

and
should
otherwise
fall
under
the
purview
of
section
and
rule
certainly
if
section
be
give
the
same
broad
reading
that
the
commission
give
to
it
in
the
nadex
order
the
cannabis
equity
index
would
certainly
involve
an
enumerate
activity
and
be
subject
to
section
and
rule
yet
the
cannabis
index
contract
be
self
certify
and
the
commission
do
not
invoke
section
or
rule
therefore
it
be
clear
that
the
commission
have
not
maintain
the
nadex
order
overbroad
and
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
and
rule
even
if
the
propose
kalshi
contracts
somehow
come
within
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
that
do
not
preclude
they
from
be
list
I
understand
that
kalshi
have
make
submission
to
the
commission
demonstrate
offer
the
contract
would
be
in
the
public
interest
a
full
discussion
of
those
point
be
outside
the
scope
of
this
letter
I
do
note
however
that
the
commission
be
not
limit
to
use
an
economic
purpose
test
for
determine
whether
a
contract
be
within
the
public
interest
that
test
be
find
nowhere
in
the
text
of
section
or
rule
one
reference
to
the
economic
purpose
test
between
two
senator
in
a
brief
discussion
of
what
would
become
section
be
insufficient
to
bind
the
commission
to
that
test

the

as

there
