dear
chairman
behnam
I
write
to
express
concern
about
bet
on
the
outcome
of
our
election
as
address
in
a
provision
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
propose
rulemake
bet
on
election
outcome
can
incentivize
those
with
financial
or
political
interest
to
interfere
with
election
and
pose
risk
to
public
confidence
in
our
democracy
notably
the
commission
have
previously
reject
proposal
to
create
political
bet
market
because
of
the
potential
negative
impact
that
such
bet
could
have
on
the
integrity
of
our
election
include
decline
to
approve
one
proposal
to
permit
bet
or
wager
on
election
just
last
year
as
we
approach
this
year
election
allow
bet
on
political
outcome
raise
concern
that
such
activity
would
motivate
target
effort
to
manipulate
election
with
disinformation
dark
money
and
false
claim
about
election
fraud
in
testimony
before
the
senate
rules
committee
election
expert
have
warn
that
disinformation
be
be
supercharge
by
emerge
technology
like
artificial
intelligence
that
be
already
be
use
to
deceive
voter
and
undermine
trust
in
the
functioning
of
our
government
national
security
official
also
continue
to
warn
about
effort
by
foreign
adversary
to
interfere
in
our
democracy
and
we
must
not
give
they
another
tool
to
do
so
I
urge
you
to
fully
consider
these
potential
threat
to
our
election
as
you
review
this
propose
rulemake
thank
you
for
your
attention
to
this
important
issue
sincerely
