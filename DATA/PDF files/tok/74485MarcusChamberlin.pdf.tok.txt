dear
cftc
commissioners
i
am
writing
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
cftc
recent
proposal
to
ban
election
contracts
while
i
understand
the
importance
of
maintaining
market
integrity
i
believe
this
proposal
overlooks
the
essential
benefits
that
election
contracts
offer
and
is
based
on
a
flawed
process
with
an
overly
broad
definition
of
gaming
i
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
approach
and
address
several
key
concerns
regarding
this
proposal
1
hedging
value
of
election
contracts
election
contracts
serve
a
critical
function
in
providing
hedging
opportunities
for
market
participants
political
events
particularly
elections
introduce
significant
uncertainty
and
volatility
into
financial
markets
businesses
and
investors
face
potential
adverse
impacts
from
sudden
policy
shifts
or
regulatory
changes
resulting
from
elections
election
contracts
offer
a
mechanism
to
manage
this
uncertainty
effectively
for
example
multinational
corporations
operating
in
diverse
political
environments
can
use
these
contracts
to
mitigate
risks
associated
with
policy
changes
following
elections
investors
concerned
about
market
volatility
due
to
electoral
outcomes
also
benefit
from
the
ability
to
stabilize
their
portfolios
banning
these
contracts
would
remove
a
valuable
tool
for
risk
management
and
could
lead
to
increased
market
instability
2
price
basing
value
forecasts
and
data
election
contracts
also
provide
crucial
information
through
their
pricing
which
reflects
aggregated
market
expectations
and
sentiment
about
electoral
outcomes
this
price
based
information
complements
traditional
opinion
polls
and
forecasts
offering
a
more
dynamic
view
of
electoral
trends
the
transparency
and
predictive
value
of
election
markets
enhance
the
robustness
of
political
forecasts
providing
media
analysts
and
policymakers
with
valuable
insights
by
banning
election
contracts
the
cftc
risks
depriving
the
public
and
decision
makers
of
an
important
data
source
that
aids
in
more
accurate
forecasting
and
understanding
of
electoral
dynamics
3
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definitions
the
process
leading
to
the
proposal
formulation
raises
significant
concerns
the
decision
to
ban
election
contracts
appears
to
have
been
made
without
a
comprehensive
examination
of
the
empirical
evidence
regarding
their
impact
and
utility
there
has
been
inadequate
engagement
with
stakeholders
who
rely
on
these
contracts
for
legitimate
purposes
and
the
analysis
supporting
the
proposal
lacks
depth
furthermore
the
definition
of
gaming
used
in
the
proposal
is
overly
broad
and
conflates
different
types
of
market
activities
this
broad
definition
undermines
a
nuanced
understanding
of
market
dynamics
and
fails
to
recognize
the
positive
roles
that
election
contracts
can
play
questions
for
the
cftc
to
address
1
empirical
evidence
and
analysis
what
specific
empirical
evidence
and
data
did
the
cftc
rely
on
to
support
the
decision
to
propose
banning
election
contracts
can
the
cftc
provide
detailed
statistics
or
case
studies
demonstrating
the
negative
impacts
of
election
contracts
on
market
integrity
or
participants
2
stakeholder
consultation
what
steps
has
the
cftc
taken
to
consult
with
stakeholders
who
use
or
rely
on
election
contracts
for
hedging
or
informational
purposes
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
incorporate
feedback
from
stakeholders
into
its
final
decision
making
process
3
hedging
and
risk
management
how
does
the
cftc
assess
the
value
of
election
contracts
for
hedging
purposes
can
you
provide
examples
where
these
contracts
have
played
a
crucial
role
in
risk
management
for
businesses
or
investors
what
alternative
mechanisms
does
the
cftc
propose
for
market
participants
who
currently
use
election
contracts
for
hedging
against
political
uncertainty
4
price
discovery
and
forecasting
what
is
the
cftc
evaluation
of
the
role
that
election
contracts
play
in
providing
price
based
information
and
enhancing
political
forecasts
how
does
the
cftc
propose
to
replace
or
supplement
the
predictive
value
offered
by
election
contracts
if
they
are
banned
5
definition
of
gaming
can
the
cftc
clarify
the
specific
criteria
used
to
define
gaming
in
the
context
of
election
contracts
how
does
this
definition
align
with
the
actual
activities
observed
in
these
markets
how
does
the
cftc
differentiate
between
speculative
activities
that
are
considered
problematic
and
those
that
are
legitimate
and
beneficial
6
regulatory
impact
assessment
has
the
cftc
conducted
a
thorough
assessment
of
the
potential
economic
and
informational
impacts
of
banning
election
contracts
on
markets
and
market
participants
what
are
the
anticipated
consequences
for
market
efficiency
transparency
and
stakeholder
interests
if
the
proposal
is
enacted
7
alternative
regulatory
approaches
what
other
regulatory
approaches
or
modifications
has
the
cftc
considered
that
could
address
any
identified
risks
associated
with
election
contracts
without
implementing
a
complete
ban
is
the
cftc
open
to
exploring
regulatory
frameworks
that
allow
for
the
continuation
of
election
contracts
under
stricter
oversight
or
modified
conditions
8
transparency
and
process
how
does
the
cftc
ensure
that
its
rulemaking
process
is
transparent
and
adequately
considers
all
relevant
viewpoints
and
evidence
what
mechanisms
are
in
place
for
ongoing
review
and
adjustment
of
regulations
related
to
election
contracts
to
ensure
they
adapt
to
evolving
market
dynamics
and
stakeholder
needs
in
conclusion
i
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
to
ban
election
contracts
these
contracts
offer
essential
hedging
tools
provide
valuable
price
based
information
and
support
market
stability
the
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definitions
used
in
the
proposal
detract
from
a
balanced
and
well
informed
regulatory
approach
a
more
nuanced
examination
of
the
role
and
impact
of
election
contracts
combined
with
stakeholder
engagement
and
empirical
analysis
is
necessary
to
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
protects
market
integrity
while
allowing
beneficial
market
activities
to
thrive
thank
you
for
considering
my
perspective
and
addressing
these
critical
questions
sincerely
