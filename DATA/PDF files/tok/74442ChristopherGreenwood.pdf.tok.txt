sought

on

contracts
because
those
contracts
do
not
involve
unlawful
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
any
similar
activity
that
the
cftc
has
specified
by
regulation
the
commission
had
no
power
to
prohibit
them
nor
are
they
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
any
event
quite
the
opposite
uncertainty
surrounding
political
events
poses
economic
risks
no
less
than
uncertainty
over
oil
supply
hurricanes
or
pandemics
as
hundreds
of
academics
business
owners
and
former
cftc
officials
thus
explained
in
formal
comments
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
enable
hedging
against
economic
risks
associated
with
partisan
control
of
congress
while
generating
valuable
predictive
data
nevertheless
the
cftc
prohibited
kalshi
from
listing
its
contracts
its
order
contorts
and
misapplies
the
cea
text
ignores
its
structure
and
purpose
allows
a
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
and
engages
in
faulty
unsupported
reasoning
it
is
unlawful
and
must
be
vacated
for
three
independent
reasons
first
in
concluding
that
kalshi
contracts
involve
enumerated
activities
the
commission
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
that
word
in
this
statutory
framework
an
event
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
if
its
underlying
event
is
or
closely
relates
to
that
activity
for
example
a
contract
contingent
on
a
terrorist
attack
on
american
soil
would
involve
terrorism
that
intuitive
interpretation
of
involve
makes
sense
of
every
enumerated
activity
and
plainly
does
not
reach
the
contracts
here
the
cftc
instead
claimed
it
can
ban
an
event
contract
if
trading
on
the
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
but
that
construction
violates
basic
interpretive
principles
it
attributes
disparate
meanings
to
a
single
statutory
term
it
renders
the
other
listed
activities
superfluous
it
upends
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
regulated
exchanges
and
it
ultimately
flips
the
statute
default
rule
by
subjecting
all
event
contracts
to
public
interest
scrutiny
second
even
if
the
commission
were
empowered
to
ban
event
contract
trading
that
would
amount
to
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
trading
on
the
contracts
here
would
not
elections
are
not
games
so
trading
contracts
on
them
is
not
gaming
nor
does
the
unlawful
activity
category
empower
states
to
ban
event
contracts
through
their
gambling
statutes
again
the
commission
broader
interpretations
of
these
terms
would
swallow
both
the
rule
and
the
other
enumerated
exceptions
finally
even
if
the
congressional
control
contracts
were
properly
subject
to
public
interest
scrutiny
the
cftc
analysis
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
commission
dismissed
comments
from
renowned
economists
investors
and
business
owners
all
of
whom
confirmed
the
concrete
real
world
hedging
benefits
of
kalshi
contracts
it
instead
improvised
heightened
requirements
that
misunderstand
how
risk
hedging
works
and
ignored
the
evidence
that
kalshi
contracts
meet
even
that
test
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
the
commission
merely
offered
unfounded
and
implausible
speculation
about
election
integrity
as
if
the
congressional
control
contracts
create
economic
exposure
to
electoral
outcomes
rather
than
reflect
it
in
short
the
cftc
decision
to
prohibit
kalshi
contracts
contradicts
both
the
statute
and
the
record
this
court
should
vacate

challenged
order

although

do
use
many
other
financial
instruments
to
capture

economic
forces
few
can
do
so
as
precisely
as
an
event
contract
for
example
a
trader
can
purchase
a

contract
on

stock
index
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
national
economy
will

index

to
correlate
with
movement
in

but
that
would
be
an
imprecise
way
to
address
whether
the
next
gdp
report
will
actually
show
economic
growth
an
event
contract
on
the
next
gdp
announcement
can
provide
that
targeted
exposure
businesses
and
individuals
use
event
contracts
like
other
derivatives
to
hedge
against
the
risk
of
an
event
happening
ar
1528
for
example
a
beachfront
property
owner
might
buy
contracts
predicting
that
a
hurricane
will
make
landfall
nearby
because
the
payout
from
those
contracts
could
offset
economic
losses
the
owner
is
likely
to
incur
if
a
storm
hits
such
an
event
contract
is
distinct
from
and
serves
a
different
function
than
an
insurance
policy
the
property
owner
could
buy
insurance
to
cover
damage
actually
incurred
from
a
storm
but
unlike
an
event
contract
that
policy
would
not
hedge
the
risk
of
other
losses
associated
with
a
hurricane
hitting
such
as
lost
rental
revenues
or
higher
costs
of
food
and
water
of
course
not
everyone
who
trades
an
event
contract
is
hedging
risk
some
simply
seek
a
return
that
is
true
of
all
derivative
markets

robust
market
depends

its

reasoned
that

the

these
contextual
difficulties

of

that
makes

of
the

the

the

the

asserts

the

thus
disproves
the

claim
that
the

always
uses

to

in

the
commission
assumption
that
involve
must
carry
some
broadening
effect
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
event
focused
reading
of
the
text
a
contract
might
involve
an
activity
even
if
it
is
not
strictly
based
on
that
activity
if
its
underlying
event
is
closely
tied
to
an
enumerated
activity
for
instance
a
contract
on
whether
the
ukrainian
military
will
acquire
certain
munitions
in
2024
might
be
said
to
involve
war
even
though
its
underlying
event
is
not
itself
an
act
of
war
a
contract
on
whether
a
certain
ceo
will
be
arrested
for
fraud
might
be
said
to
involve
unlawful
activity
even
though
the
arrest
is
not
itself
unlawful
in
other
words
congress
could
have
chosen
the
term
involve
to
prevent
circumvention
through
contracts
that
are
based
on
events
technically
distinct
from
but
still
closely
related
to
the
enumerated
activities
the
intuition
that
involve
is
broader
than
some
alternatives
therefore
does
not
warrant
let
alone
require
dramatically
shifting
the
statute
focus
from
the
underlying
event
to
the

the

its

alter
the

governing

render

superfluous
and
its
approach
to

is
self
defeating
because
states
cannot

trading
a
congressional

therefore
does
not
amount
to
either

or
a

this
legal
error
too

to
sweep

gaming

anyone

staking

as

there

requires
the

trading
congressional

is
also
not
unlawful

the

similarly
misreads
the

exception
even

erroneous
reading
of

that
exception
does
not
apply
here
because
buying
or
selling
a
congressional

contract
does
not
amount
to
illegal
activity
the
commission
contrary
reasoning
is
incoherent
the
commission
contends
that
purchasing
one
of

with
the
general
assumption
that
in
the
absence

a
plain
indication
to
the
contrary
congress
when
it
enacts
a
statute
is
not
making
the

to

efforts
fail

trading
these

contracts
can
not
be
squeezed
into
the
categories

either

not
without
mangling
the
cea
structure
rendering
every
other
exception
surplusage
and
turning
the
principle
of
federal
supremacy
on
its
head
of
course
congress
is
free
to
forbid
trading
of
political
event
contracts
or
to
authorize
the
commission
to
do
so
it
would
be
as
simple
as
adding
contracts
that
involve
elections
to
the
enumerated
activities
in
the

congress
did
not
do
that

the

had
no
authority
to
subject

congressional
control
contracts
to

review
in
the
first
place
because
its
conclusion
that
the
contracts
involve

unlawful
activity
is
erroneous
as
a
matter
of

on
multiple
levels
that
is

the

the

its

around
economic

asking
whether
the
congressional

have
economic
utility
insisting
on
some
economic

is
sensible
given
that
the

identifies

the
problem

it
here
first

misunderstands
the
economic
function
of
hedging
and
price
basing
the
point
of
hedging
is
to
mitigate
risk
not
like
insurance
to
offset
precise
losses
and
risk
is
all
about
uncertainty
consider

hotel
that
acquires
contracts
on
a
hurricane
impacting
the
gulf
of
mexico
whether
such
a
hurricane
would
actually
harm
the
hotel
bottom
line
depends
on
various
factors
including
where
the
storm
strikes
whether
it
damages
the
hotel
and
whether
news
coverage

tourists
see
ar

indeed
if
the
hurricane
ends
up
hitting
neighboring
beaches
but
leaving
the
immediate
coastline
untouched
the
hotel
could
bring
in
more
revenue
by
attracting
a
larger
share
of
the
business
but
the
risk
of
loss
climbs
if
a
storm
materializes
at
all
that
risk
warrants
hedging
as
this
example
illustrates
it
is
commonplace
for
businesses
to
buy
hedging
instruments
without
certainty
that
the
event
will
actually
manifest
in
net
harm

the

absurd

while

it

job

the

likewise
while
