dear
kirkpatrick
thank
you
for
providing
an
opportunity
for
public
comment
i
am
writing
to
express
opposition
to
both
the
categorical
classification
of
contracts
involving
gaming
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
resulting
prohibition
that
would
engender
for
certain
types
of
swaps
a
subset
of
professional
sports
teams
are
currently
considering
a
category
of
otc
swaps
that
are
being
developed
to
help
those
teams
mitigate
the
financial
risk
of
player
underperformance
these
swaps
which
would
be
executed
between
eligible
contract
participants
would
settle
based
on
the
longitudinal
statistical
performance
of
an
athlete
whose
contract
would
be
hedged
they
are
being
designed
as
an
alternative
to
disability
insurance
that
goes
beyond
just
injury
protection
allowing
teams
to
hedge
against
the
financial
risks
of
player
underperformance
regardless
of
the
source
of
that
underperformance
i
believe
the
listing
for
trading
and
availability
for
clearing
of
those
swaps
through
registered
swap
execution
facilities
would
provide
a
more
efficient
market
for
a
legitimate
form
of
business
risk
hedging
the
utility
of
which
would
be
in
the
public
interest
i
further
believe
that
at
least
for
that
category
of
contracts
hedging
utility
should
be
a
considered
factor
when
determining
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
public
interest
what
we
do
reifi
is
seeking
to
build
products
that
mitigate
financial
risk
inherent
to
pro
athlete
contracts
athlete
salaries
are
often
guaranteed
and
as
a
result
teams
undertake
large
long
term
financial
risks
when
signing
professional
athletes
to
contracts
a
player
could
experience
a
career
ending
injury
early
on
in
their
contract
or
they
could
simply
fail
to
live
up
to
performance
expectations
for
a
plethora
of
reasons
outside
of
the
team
and
player
control
these
are
not
hypothetical
occurrences
particularly
in
major
league
baseball
where
collective
bargaining
has
secured
guaranteed
full
payment
of
player
contracts
regardless
of
the
player
eventual
performance
prior
to
the
2020
mlb
season
the
washington
nationals
signed
pitcher
stephen
strasburg
to
a
245
m
7
year
contract
an
injury
severely
hampered
the
first
two
seasons
of
that
contract
and
then
effectively
ended
strasburg
career
mid
way
through
the
following
season
in
2014
the
boston
red
sox
signed
rusney
castillo
to
a
m
7
year
contract
castillo
did
not
face
any
major
injury
concerns
but
failed
to
perform
up
to
expectations
for
two
seasons
before
being
moved
down
to
the
minor
league
system
for
the
remainder
of
the
contract
this
all
leads
to
highly
inefficient
salary
spend
for
pro
sports
teams
according
to
reifi
analysis
mlb
teams
spent
a
projected
or
33
of
total
payroll
spend
on
injured
or
underperforming
players
during
the
2023
season
the
only
product
that
teams
currently
have
access
to
for
hedging
these
risks
comes
in
the
form
of
disability
insurance
which
protects
against
the
risk
of
some
injury
related
underperformance
but
not
against
the
risk
of
other
forms
of
underperformance
team
executives
have
told
reifi
that
the
disability
insurance
market
has
been
drying
up
over
the
last
decade
in
addition
to
rising
prices
policies
have
generally
started
to
exclude
certain
injuries
and
require
waiting
periods
of
60
90
in
the
case
of
stephen
strasburg
it
is
reported
that
the
nationals
were
unable
to
secure
disability
insurance
due
to
the
prohibitive
cost
of
such
coverage
in
the
case
of
rusney
castillo
there
are
no
currently
available
products
that
can
protect
teams
from
the
financial
sunk
costs
of
uninjured
underperforming
players
team
executives
have
also
told
reifi
that
they
have
even
requested
insurers
build
them
a
product
based
on
player
performance
and
not
just
injury
but
that
the
underwriters
noted
among
other
reasons
that
their
insurance
products
are
poorly
structured
to
account
for
multi
variable
outcomes
such
as
player
performance
as
opposed
to
binary
outcomes
such
as
injury
these
inefficient
salary
expenses
are
ultimately
passed
on
to
consumers
in
the
form
of
increased
ticket
merchandise
and
concession
prices
as
well
as
a
saturation
of
ads
distracting
from
the
onfield
entertainment
product
as
a
result
an
inability
to
hedge
these
business
risks
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
is
in
this
market
vacuum
that
reifi
has
been
working
to
build
financial
products
that
help
pro
sports
teams
mitigate
the
financial
risks
of
athlete
underperformance
it
is
in
the
context
of
player
performance
a
multivariable
outcome
with
economic
implications
that
reifi
seeks
to
utilize
a
derivatives
contract
to
handle
situations
that
insurance
is
poorly
structured
to
solve
with
the
proposed
product
teams
would
pay
a
premium
to
institutional
investors
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
to
hedge
against
the
underperformance
of
one
of
their
players
against
a
predetermined
benchmark
if
the
player
meets
that
benchmark
during
the
season
the
investor
keeps
the
premium
but
if
the
player
falls
short
the
investor
reimburses
the
team
an
amount
proportional
to
the
shortfall
beyond
just
mitigating
risk
and
ensuring
fiscal
stability
the
goal
of
the
product
would
be
to
enable
teams
to
sign
franchise
altering
players
that
can
drive
more
wins
clinch
playoff
berths
and
get
fans
into
the
seats
while
also
rebound
financially
if
things
do
go
according
to
plan
for
the
institutional
investors
serving
as
counterparties
these
products
would
offer
the
potential
for
a
return
that
is
uncorrelated
with
the
broader
market
these
products
would
be
operationalized
as
swap
contracts
that
settle
based
on
the
longitudinal
statistical
performance
of
a
player
over
the
course
of
one
or
more
seasons
they
would
be
entered
into
solely
by
eligible
contract
participants
and
league
rules
would
prohibit
teams
from
any
secondary
trading
of
those
swap
contracts
in
order
to
prevent
perverse
incentives
and
the
team
manipulation
of
a
player
performance
the
settlement
amounts
would
be
structured
such
that
the
economic
benefit
of
player
underperformance
would
always
be
less
than
the
economic
benefit
of
a
performing
player
additionally
performance
would
be
measured
using
a
composite
statistic
that
takes
months
for
a
player
to
accumulate
this
prevents
any
quick
wins
where
a
team
could
negatively
affect
a
player
aggregate
performance
statistics
in
a
short
period
of
time
in
order
to
secure
a
larger
settlement
amount
any
long
term
attempts
from
a
team
to
negatively
affect
player
performance
would
generally
be
protected
against
in
each
league
respective
collective
bargaining
agreement
where
current
rule
proposals
would
prohibit
future
activities
in
the
public
interest
in
the
future
to
operationalize
the
proposed
product
reifi
would
seek
to
register
as
a
licensed
broker
dealer
and
believes
it
would
be
beneficial
to
list
the
proposed
contracts
for
trading
and
make
them
available
for
clearing
on
cftc
registered
swap
execution
facilities
we
expect
that
by
soliciting
multiple
bids
for
each
contract
and
by
creating
a
secondary
market
these
contracts
could
be
more
competitively
priced
lowering
costs
for
pro
sports
teams
and
making
it
easier
to
hedge
their
business
risks
related
to
player
underperformance
reifi
holds
that
these
contracts
which
would
be
entered
into
solely
by
eligible
contract
participants
on
swap
execution
facilities
and
from
which
teams
would
be
prohibited
from
trading
would
avoid
many
of
the
concerns
the
commision
has
voiced
about
other
forms
of
contracts
involving
gaming
reifi
comments
the
commision
elaborated
on
multiple
public
interest
determinations
with
respect
to
contracts
involving
gaming
and
requested
comments
on
whether
there
are
contracts
that
may
involve
gaming
that
do
not
raise
those
public
interest
concerns
reifi
believes
that
the
contracts
elucidated
in
the
prior
section
would
avoid
those
public
interest
concerns
and
would
be
in
the
public
interest
namely
the
commission
in
effect
noted
that
contracts
involving
gaming
have
the
following
public
interest
concerns
which
i
have
replied
to
in
turn
the
economic
impacts
are
generally
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
price
of
a
related
derivative
limiting
the
hedging
utility
of
that
derivative
decades
of
rigorous
statistical
analysis
conducted
by
pro
sports
teams
particularly
in
the
mlb
has
generated
a
consensus
on
the
monetary
cost
teams
are
willing
to
pay
for
a
given
unit
of
performance
on
the
free
agent
market
home
runs
strike
outs
wins
above
replacement
etc
reifi
proposed
contracts
directly
recycle
that
framework
to
enable
teams
to
hedge
against
underperformance
and
the
related
costs
with
a
swap
that
explicitly
settles
based
on
the
player
statistical
performance
and
the
related
monetary
value
of
that
performance
as
a
result
the
price
of
reifi
proposed
contracts
directly
and
linearly
correlates
with
the
observable
longitudinal
on
field
performance
of
the
player
in
question
such
contracts
will
predominantly
be
traded
to
enable
gambling
or
be
used
by
speculators
who
either
have
no
or
at
best
have
only
occasional
commercial
or
hedging
interests
reifi
proposed
contracts
would
be
entered
into
solely
by
a
team
which
is
explicitly
seeking
to
hedge
business
risks
and
one
or
more
institutional
investors
all
of
whom
would
be
eligible
contract
participants
with
the
transaction
occurring
through
a
cftc
registered
swap
execution
facility
such
contracts
will
have
only
a
small
universe
of
participants
with
predictable
economic
consequences
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
and
that
the
majority
of
participants
will
only
be
seeking
entertainment
purposes
the
plurality
of
participants
in
reifi
proposed
contracts
would
be
pro
sports
teams
who
explicitly
seek
to
hedge
business
risks
the
remaining
participants
would
be
institutional
investors
seeking
a
net
positive
expected
return
that
would
be
uncorrelated
with
the
broader
market
the
small
universe
of
participants
with
predictable
economic
consequences
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
are
likely
to
have
access
to
information
influence
that
can
be
used
to
artificially
move
or
manipulate
the
market
the
pro
sports
teams
in
question
for
reifi
proposed
contracts
would
be
prohibited
from
any
secondary
trading
of
such
contracts
the
individuals
who
have
influence
in
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
contest
even
if
prohibited
from
trading
such
contracts
will
be
vulnerable
to
pressure
or
persuasion
by
others
who
have
taken
a
position
in
the
contract
for
reifi
proposed
contracts
the
team
coaching
staff
and
the
players
themselves
would
be
the
prohibited
from
trading
individuals
who
would
have
influence
on
the
player
longitudinal
performance
the
incentives
of
the
institutional
investors
and
both
the
player
and
the
team
coaching
staff
would
be
aligned
the
institutional
investor
earns
a
net
positive
return
when
the
player
in
question
is
healthy
and
performs
well
the
team
coaching
staff
is
charged
with
putting
together
a
healthy
team
that
performs
well
if
they
fail
to
do
so
they
are
generally
fired
and
become
progressively
less
hireable
a
similar
dynamic
exists
for
the
players
themselves
thus
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
careers
of
both
the
players
and
the
coaching
staff
for
the
players
in
question
to
remain
healthy
and
perform
well
furthermore
reifi
will
reiterate
that
the
settlement
amounts
would
be
structured
such
that
the
economic
benefit
of
player
underperformance
would
always
be
less
than
the
economic
benefit
of
a
performing
player
additionally
performance
would
be
measured
using

to

any
long
term
attempts
from
a
team
to
negatively
affect
player
performance
would
generally
be
protected
against
in
each
league
collective
bargaining
agreement
such
contracts
would
have
no
underlying
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
directly
correlated
price
forming
information
rather
price
forming
information
is
either
nonexistent
or
driven
by
informational
sources
that
are
unregulated
opaque
or
unscientific
the
free
agent
market
for
signing
pro
athletes
to
contracts
provides
for
an
underlying
cash
market
with
clear
bona
fide
economic
transactions
for
reifi
proposed
contracts
these
would
be
the
exact
business
costs
teams
would
seek
to
hedge
risk
on
price
forming
information
which
comes
in
the
form
of
historical
player
performance
data
is
transparent
and
widely
publicly
available
on
the
internet
live
tv
or
radio
and
through
a
host
of
sports
data
vendors
such
contracts
could
cause
the
general
public
to
conflate
gaming
and
investing
which
could
signal
to
others
that
derivative
markets
are
appropriate
venues
for
retail
market
participants
to
trade
for
entertainment
purposes
which
could
minimize
for
those
investors
unique
characteristics
and
risks
of
trading
more
generally
in
derivative
markets
reifi
proposed

would
be
entered

all
of
whom

be
eligible

institutional
investors
have
told
reifi
they
would
generally
be
interested
in
such
proposed
contracts
because
the
net
positive
expected
returns
would
be
uncorrelated
with
the
broader
market
that
gambling
is
overseen
by
state
regulators
with
particular
expertise
and
governed
by
state
gaming
laws
aimed
at
addressing
particular
risks
and
concerns
associated
with
gambling
and
that
the
commission
is
not
a
gaming
regulator
and
is
not
well
placed
to
protect
against
gambling
specific
risks
an
aim
of
reifi
commentary
has
been
to
demonstrate
that
reifi
proposed
contracts
do
not
constitute
what
the
commission
generally
interprets
to
be
gambling
and
that
these
proposed
contracts
would
be
in
the
public
interest
conclusion
reifi
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
submit
these
comments
with
respect
to
the
commission
proposed
rules
around
event
contracts
which
would
effectively
prohibit
contracts
involving
gaming
we
respectfully
request
that
the
commision
consider
that
the
contracts
proposed
by
reifi
would
be
both
in
the
public
interest
and
would
generally
avoid
the
public
interest
determinations
the
commission
categorically
believes
applies
to
contracts
involving
gaming
as
a
result
reifi
hopes
that
the
commission
would
allow
for
the
listing
for
trading
and
availability
for
clearing
of
such
swaps
through
registered
swap
execution
facilities
we
would
welcome
the
