dear
chairman
and
commissioners
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
i
am
writing
to
support
the
kalshi
exchange
request
to
list
contracts
related
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
my
name
is
greg
kuserk
and
i
served
at
the
commission
for
33
years
in
various
capacities
my
career
there
began
in
1987
in
the
research
section
of
the
division
of
economic
analysis
where
i
eventually
served
as
a
senior
economist
i
served
as
the
economic
advisor
to
commissioner
sharon
brown
hruska
and
as
her
chief
of
staff
during
her
tenure
as
acting
chairman
i
also
served
as
deputy
director
of
market
surveillance
in
the
division
of
market
oversight
dmo
and
as
deputy
director
of
product
review
also
in
dmo
now
retired
i
am
grateful
for
the
time
i
was
able
to
serve
at
the
commission
and
the
accomplishments
i
was
part
of
over
the
years
these
accomplishments
included
fostering
major
industry
innovations
such
as
the
development
of
regulations
for
hybrid
instruments
structured
notes
and
swap
contracts
that
produced
meaningful
value
to
market
participants
and
the
public
i
also
worked
closely
with
the
division
of
enforcement
as
both
an
expert
witness
and
consultant
on
numerous
actions
related
to
illegal
off
exchange
activity
my
interest
in
providing
the
comments
below
is
to
be
able
to
share
the
institutional
knowledge
i
developed
over
my
years
at
the
commission
to
assist
you
in
reaching
a
decision
with
respect
to
the
products
before
you
i
encourage
the
commission
to
recognize
the
value
and
importance
of
election
markets
although
event
contracts
have
not
historically
been
the
type
of
instruments
that
the
commission
has
been
charged
with
regulating
congress
more
recently
in
dodd
frank
has
seen
it
appropriate
to
authorize
the
commission
to
regulate
these
markets
as
the
commission
has
recognized
through
its
various
enforcement
and
similar
actions
for
example
intrade
the
iowa
electronic
market
predictit
and
nadex
on
election
markets
these
markets
have
been
appropriately
determined
to
be
within
the
commission
jurisdiction
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
while
event
contracts
are
relatively
new
the
commission
is
the
appropriate
choice
of
regulator
i
believe
that
the
commission
through
its
staff
has
significant
expertise
in
regulating
important
and
valuable
markets
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
can
successfully
regulate
these
markets
too
what
i
would
like
to
offer
to
the
commission
in
this
comment
letter
is
an
expansion
on
my
views
as
to
what
i
see
as
the
most
important
issues
involved
in
approving
these
election
contracts
i
see
three
issues
first
i
want
to
clarify
that
event
contracts
differ
from
futures
and
options
contracts
and
present
different
considerations
second
even
though
they
are
new
to
the
scene
congress
has
placed
these
contracts
under
the
commission
jurisdiction
and
the
commission
has
acted
on
that
grant
third
these
contracts
are
not
gaming
and
are
in
the
public
interest
because
they
essentially
are
a
competitor
to
opinion
polls
and
likely
a
better
product
futures
or
options
event
contracts
are
not
futures
or
options
and
they
do
not
have
the
hallmark
of
futures
and
options
of
being
based
on
a
price
as
an
example
if
the
price
of
corn
goes
up
by
x
or
down
by
y
the
price
of
the
futures
contract
will
roughly
change
by
x
or
for
an
option
the
contract
will
go
or
out
of
the
money
based
on
the
price
change
of
the
underlying
commodity
if
in
the
money
it
will
rise
or
fall
in
sync
with
the
underlying
price
change
event
contracts
are
not
based
on
an
underlying
price
given
that
these
are
not
traditional
futures
or
option
contracts
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
given
the
commission
the
authority
to
regulate
them
and
whether
the
commission
has
assumed
that
authority
i
address
this
question
next
congressional
and
commission
approval
while
i
am
not
offering
a
legal
opinion
here
as
discussed
above
i
do
believe
that
the
language
in
the
act
regarding
event
contracts
shows
that
congress
entrusted
the
commission
with
regulating
these
markets
i
also
note
that
actions
taken
by
the
commission
do
establish
that
the
commission
more
likely
than
not
has
jurisdiction
over
these
contracts
regardless
of
how
the
commission
ultimately
decides
on
the
products
before
its
consideration
now
i
encourage
that
you
take
this
opportunity
to
clearly
state
the
commission
position
on
these
contracts
these
election
contracts
are
valuable
contracts
and
are
not
gaming
because
event
contracts
are
not
futures
or
options
they
present
different
considerations
to
the
commission
one
useful
factor
that
the
commission
can
use
in
deciding
whether
to
approve
an
event
contract
is
if
the
contracts
are
valuable
in
a
public
interest
sense
that
leads
to
the
question
of
whether
election
contracts
are
valuable
in
a
public
interest
sense
i
argue
yes
these
contracts
are
not
gaming
elections
are
events
that
are
very
important
to
the
public
and
there
is
a
very
strong
public
interest
in
having
accurate
data
regarding
elections
this
is
clear
from
the
very
prominent
place
that
election
polling
plays
in
society
as
stated
above
these
contracts
will
benefit
the
public
interest
by
giving
the
public
data
that
would
complement
or
even
compete
with
opinion
polls
but
with
the
advantage
that
participants
in
the
market
have
a
monetary
stake
in
their
opinion
elections
have
far
more
importance
in
a
public
interest
sense
than
sporting
events
or
other
trivial
matters
the
public
is
better
served
by
a
regulated
market
that
is
subject
to
oversight
and
surveillance
than
by
opinion
polls
that
are
unregulated
and
where
participants
have
no
incentive
in
providing
sincere
responses
my
recommendation
is
that
the
commission
approve
the
request
by
the
kalshi
exchange
to
list
political
event
contracts
and
election
contracts
i
would
also
encourage
the
commission
to
take
this
opportunity
to
revisit
the
2008
concept
release
73
fed
reg
25669
and
provide
additional
clarity
on
the
types
of
events
that
are
appropriate
for
commission
regulation
i
am
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
give
input
on
this
matter
and
am
confident
that
these
important
markets
will
be
an
important
addition
to
the
markets
that
thrive
under
the
commission
regulation
sincerely
gregory
kuserk
