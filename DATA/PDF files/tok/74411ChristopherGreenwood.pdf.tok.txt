honorable
chairman

commissioners

trading
commission
cftc
as
the
commission
and
staff
of
the
cftc
well
know
speculators
play
a
vital
role
in
capital
markets
in
general
and
futures
markets
in
particular
both
markets
assume
risks
that
are
an
integral
part
of
our
well
functioning
financial
system
which
continues
to
be
the
envy
of
the
world
in
futures
markets
commercial
entities
transfer
part
of
their
risk
to
the
speculator
who
in
turn
assume
that
risk
for
the
opportunity
to
earn
a
profit
a
major
misconception
that
still
prevails
among
the
public
is
the
equivalence
of
gambling
and
speculation
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
gambling
is
an
artificial
self
constructed
risk
created
for
recreation
speculation
is
the
assumption
of
risks
that
already
exist
in
the
real
and
financial
markets
the
recreational
risk
of
gambling
is
not
present
until
the
casino
or
racetrack
is
built
and
wagers
are
accepted
on
the
other
hand
risk
in
the
production
of
good
and
services
in
the
economy
are
real
and
will
exist
even
in
the
absence
of
futures
markets
the
same
can
be
said
for
equity
and
interest
rate
and
risk
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
the
risks
associated
with
policy
changes
from
different
election
outcomes
are
most
similar
to
the
latter
the
transfer
of
risk
by
hedgers
would
be
real
and
the
assumption
of
that
risk
by
speculators
would
be
proper
this
distinction
builds
on
work
done
by
both
as
academics
and
practitioners
almost
fifty
years
ago
the
chicago
board
of
trade
published
a
booklet
for
speculators
entitled
speculating
in
futures
a
copy
will
be
sent
under
separate
cover
it
clearly
underlines
the
differences
between
hedgers
and
speculators
their
interaction
as
market
participants
and
the
speculators
key
role
to
help
facilitate
efficient
risk
transfer
as
we
enter
a
new
era
with
innovation
in
new
products
and
deconstruction
of
existing
ones
those
of
us
who
care
deeply
about
our
futures
markets
hope
this
distinction
between
gambling
and
speculation
will
help
guide
future
decisions
that
the
commission
may
encounter
as
always
long
time
market
participants
and
practitioners
stand
ready
to
be
an
unbiased
resource
to
the
commission
and
its
staff
