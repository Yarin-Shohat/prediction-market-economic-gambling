the
proposed
contracts
do
not
involve
gaming
politics
is
no
mere
sport
carried
out
for
the
entertainment
and
fleecing
of
bystanders
to
the
enrichment
of
the
participants
in
a
legitimate
sport
both
the
victor
and
the
loser
gets
paid
as
recognition
for
their
services
however
political
contests
only
benefit
the
candidate
whomstve
emerges
victorious
and
their
extended
family
2
the
commission
should
pay
no
heed
to
the
availability
of
similar
bets
in
traditional
gambling
venues
such
as
casinos
yes
if
i
wanted
to
i
could
fly
to
vegas
and
gamble
away
my
life
savings
at
ease
but
this
is
not
a
sufficient
substitute
as
it
does
not
provide
the
instant
gratification
that
comes
from
being
able
to
gamble
from
the
comfort
of
my
house
in
my
underwear
i
would
go
one
step
further
and
suggest
that
the
commission
explicitly
permit
kalshi
to
accept
instant
cryptocurrency
transfers
which
is
universally
acknowledged
as
the
goated
medium
of
exchange
for
degenerate
gamblers
3
as
someone
who
commits
three
felonies
a
day
in
other
words
an
american
citizen
i
would
presume
that
this
violates
regulations
too
numerous
to
count
however
as
a
legal
realist
i
must
too
recognize
that
the
odds
of
anyone
being
prosecuted
for
gambling
on
an
election
website
is
approximately
null
excepting
if
donald
trump
were
to
purchase
851
worth
of
any
contract
4
i
would
certainly
hope
that
the
commission
does
not
engage
in
rule
making
under
the
influence
5
the
nadex
contracts
in
question
are
older
than
the
dinosaurs
and
self
evidently
obsolete
elections
in
2022
are
substantially
different
than
those
in
2012
involving
a
different
populace
different
candidates
and
a
newly
gerrymandered
map
along
with
extensive
hard
work
at
voter
suppression
additionally
the
apr
2nd
date
of
the
order
unceremoniously
banishing
nadex
to
the
nether
regions
suggests
the
possibility
of
the
whole
thing
being
an
elaborate
april
fools
prank
the
commission
should
ignore
the
decision
of
the
prior
commissioners
you
are
in
charge
now
act
like
it
6
i
expend
significant
resources
each
election
cycle
bribing
politicians
across
the
country
the
proposed
contracts
are
essential
in
hedging
my
investments
without
the
ability
to
hedge
i
would
be
forced
to
cut
such
activities
as
the
risk
of
loss
would
be
too
high
7
the
risks
of
my
preferred
political
party
being
in
power
can
not
be
hedged
via
existing
derivative
products
as
those
are
tied
to
specific
assets
that
may
not
necessarily
move
in
the
same
direction
as
the
assets
i
expect
my
politicians
to
promote
8
if
henry
ford
had
asked
his
customers
what
they
wanted
they
would
have
said
a
faster
horse
the
lack
of
any
plausible
conceivable
or
metaphysically
possible
legitimate
hedging
uses
for
a
market
should
not
deter
the
commission
from
expeditiously
approving
this
application
if
you
build
it
people
will
come
in
addition
requiring
evidence
from
users
of
their
hedging
uses
violates
their
first
amendment
rights
cf
citizens
united
9
the
commission
should
not
consider
contract
sizes
in
determining
the
hedging
utility
of
the
product
there
are
at
least
two
sides
to
every
market
if
my
legitimate
hedging
needs
require
attracting
large
amounts
of
small
retail
users
on
the
other
side
that
should
be
encouraged
i
would
further
suggest
encouraging
the
use
of
at
least
100x
leverage
if
not
more
so
smaller
users
can
help
support
the
liquidity
needs
of
whales
such
as
myself
10
our
entire
computational
economy
is
built
on
the
binary
system
anything
and
everything
can
be
reduced
into
binary
terms
a
sufficient
number
of
binary
contracts
can
be
utilized
to
hedge
any
event
including
nonbinary
ones
11
the
contracts
serve
a
legitimate
and
highly
desirable
pricing
function
for
example
a
store
could
sell
people
political
apparel
such
as
t
shirts
or
caps
on
credit
and
their
underwriter
can
price
the
default
risk
based
on
the
probabilities
of
the
relevant
political
party
being
in
power
12
to
paraphrase
james
burnham
the
public
may
not
be
interested
in
the
proposed
contracts
but
the
proposed
contracts
are
interested
in
the
public
if
there
is
uncertainty
about
how
much
public
interest
there
might
be
in
these
markets
i
would
simply
suggest
adding
additional
markets
to
determine
that
13
i
was
going
to
write
a
detailed
response
to
this
question
but
i
got
distracted
by
the
apparently
unironic
use
of
perception
of
the
integrity
of
elections
in
14
as
discussed
in
my
response
to
3
this
likely
violates
many
such
laws
regarding
the
specific
concern
of
campaigns
using
some
kind
of
morse
code
signalling
via
election
market
pricing
to
bypass
restrictions
on
coordinations
between
cccs
and
pacs
i
personally
and
respectfully
submit
this
is
improbable
15
this
concern
is
misplaced
everyone
who
has
not
yet
voted
is
in
exclusive
possession
of
non
public
polling
data
with
trading
on
private
information
is
not
and
has
never
been
improper
and
the
commission
is
well
placed
to
enforce
prohibitions
on
illegal
insider
trading
as
long
as
it
not
by
current
former
or
future
members
of
congress
16
i
object
to
the
implication
that
nancy
pelosi
can
freely
trade
whatever
stonks
she
wants
but
when
a
new
innovative
market
wants
to
offer
similar
hedging
instruments
to
members
of
congress
they
should
be
prevented
from
doing
so
our
congresscritters
should
be
equally
allowed
to
degenerately
gamble
away
their
life
savings
and
federal
pension
as
any
other
american
