political
prediction
markets
provide
valuable
forecasting
data
that
contributes
to
a
better
understanding
of
current
events
and
possible
future
outcomes
an
electoral
prediction
market
does
not
replace
other
methods
of
forecasting
or
analyzing
information
it
rather
adds
an
important
tool
to
help
make
better
informed
decisions
prediction
markets
are
similar
in
many
respects
to
other
markets
the
price
of
a
stock
bond
or
a
commodity
future
is
in
a
sense
a
forecast
of
the
value
of
an
unknown
future
be
it
the
value
of
a
commodity
the
expected
revenues
of
a
business
or
the
business
outcome
resulting
from
an
acquisition
the
forecasts
represented
by
these
prices
provide
information
that
drives
decisions
in
a
variety
of
sectors
farmers
for
example
routinely
use
futures
markets
to
make
decisions
about
which
crops
to
plant
political
prediction
markets
can
do
the
same
for
those
who
are
navigating
a
constantly
evolving
political
landscape
in
order
to
manage
risk
and
maximize
their
impact
prediction
markets
offer
several
benefits

first
the
market
mechanism
allows
for
near
real
time
incorporation
of
new
information
in
contrast
other
tools
such
as
public
polling
only
offer
a
snapshot
in
time
and
can
lag
in
reflecting
the
shifts
in
public
sentiment
as
situations
change
second
the
market
mechanism
creates
a
financial
incentive
for
individuals
to
express
what
they
believe
will
happen
not
what
they
hope
will
happen
or
even
necessarily
want
to
have
happen
this
too
is
better
than
relying
on
many
of
the
alternatives
for
example
political
analysts
can
provide
insight
but
may
have
incentives
to
generate
support
for
a
particular
position
or
outcome
or
social
pressure
sometimes
leads
individuals
to
share
what
they
believe
is
the
right
opinion
even
if
it
differs
from
their
private
views
recent
research
has
found
that
across
all
demographics
every
subgroup
had
multiple
issues
with
a
double
digit
gap
between
public
and
private
opinion
populace
insights
private

america
populace
one
consequence
is
that
individuals
may
publicly
misrepresent
their
own
private
views
in
public
polling
or
focus
groups
finally
participants
may
not
individually
have
all
the
needed
information
but
the
market
mechanism
creates
an
incentive
to
reveal
what
they
know
which
is
then
pooled
to
produce
the
best
estimate
or
forecast
political
election
markets
have
practical
applications
we
need
a
clearer
regulatory
roadmap
that
would
allow
for
more
not
fewer
prediction
markets
to
contribute
to
our
understanding
of
emerging
events
and
outcomes
for
example
prediction
markets
could
play
a
greater
role
in
our

such
a
market
would
have
been
invaluable
to

pandemic
response
and
indeed
could
still
be
valuable
information
given
the
uncertainty
of

waves

steven
phillips

the
vice
president
for

collaborative
suggests
that
applying
a
detached
prediction
market
lens
approach
may
produce
provocative
and
perhaps
more
accurate
pandemic
forecasts
than
pure

approaches

there
are
numerous
public
benefits
to
the
information
provided
in
election
prediction
markets
including
helping
organizations
forecast
the
political
landscape
in
order
to
make
better
strategic
decisions
this
is
true
not
only
for
businesses
and
trade
associations
but
also
philanthropies
and
non
profits
in
heavily
regulated
sectors
that
need
to
navigate
dynamic
policy
and
political
environments
election
markets
also
provide
important
information
that
entrepreneurs
and
investors
can
use
when
assessing
the
regulatory
and
political
risk
associated
with
new
business
ventures
reducing
even
a
little
uncertainty
can
be
the
difference
in
unlocking
the
capital
to
support
entrepreneurs
tackling
climate

improving
student

outcomes
or
expanding
access
to

benefits
outweigh
the
risks
kalshi
proposal
does
not
pose
a
risk
to
the
integrity
of
the
election
system
election
trading
is
a
normal
procedure
in
other
established
strong
democracies
like
the
australia
and
ireland
predictit
and
other
tests
in
the
united
states
have
proven
fruitful
for
researchers
and
the
public
the
valuable
insights
provided
through
a
regulated
election
market
far
outweigh
any
of
the
potential
risks
election
markets
in
particular
have
proven
to
be
a
powerful
tool
for
forecasting
elections
and
are
typically
more
accurate
timely
and
complete
than
alternative
methods
such
as
polling
they
would
provide
significant
benefits
to
voters
the
media
philanthropies
non

investors
and

approving
kalshi
submission
would
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
for
the
commission
and
promotes
the
public
interest
