dear
kirkpatrick
thank
you
very
much
for
giving
us
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
your
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
on
event
contracts
the
cftc
is
proposing
amendments
to
its
rules
concerning
event
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
the
cftc
is
proposing
amendments
to
further
specify
types
of
event
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
or
the
act
and
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
that
they
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
on
or
through
a
cftc
entity
among
other
things
the
cftc
proposes
to
further
specify
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
the
cftc
also
proposes
to
amend
certain
language
in
its
event
contract
rules
to
further
align
with
statutory
text
and
to
make
certain
technical
changes
to
its
event
contract
rules
in
order
to
enhance
clarity
and
organization
i
strongly
support
your
proposals
which
codify
the
cftc
views
around
what
event
contracts
may
be
impermissible
gaming
under
the
cea
congressional
intent
section
of
the
dodd
frank
act
amended
section
5c
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
by
adding
the
following
under
new
concerning
event
contracts
which
states
that
event
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
levels
of
a
commodity
described
in
section
by
a
designated
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
i
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
you
propose
to
define
gaming
in
new
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
furthermore
proposed
states
that
gaming
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
an
awards
contest
or
a
game
in
which
one
or
more
athletes
compete
or
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
i
strongly
support
these
proposals
which
specify
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
and
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
will
increase
regulatory
clarity
and
reduce
the
likelihood
that
a
registered
entity
would
list
for
trading
an
event
contract
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
lack
of
definite
economic
rationale
certain
event
contracts
may
serve
a
useful
economic
purpose
for
example
weather
derivatives
covering
snowfall
or
hurricanes
offer
protection
against
actual
suffered
losses
entities
can
use
such
derivatives
in
risk
management
to
protect
against
actual
suffered
losses
caused
by
adverse
or
unexpected
weather
conditions
i
would
argue
that
contracts
that
are
based
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
offer
no
such
reliable
or
predictable
protection
against
actual
suffered
losses
whilst
weather
is
purely
random
political
contests
including
an
election
or
elections
and
their
ramifications
are
based
on
future
human
decisions
which
can
vary
but
are
certainly
not
random
i
must
say
that
i
find
the
concept
of
using
such
contracts
to
protect
against
actual
suffered
losses
caused
by
political
contests
including
an
election
or
elections
to
be
quite
perverse
and
not
in
line
with
the
public
interest
role
of
the
cftc
i
agree
with
cftc
chair
rostin
behnam
statements
about
the
impact
that
political
event
contracts
could
have
on
the
role
of
the
cftc
during
an
odd
lots
podcast
behnam
stated
that
imagine
a
situation
where
we
have
alleged
fraud
or
alleged
manipulation
of
an
election
and
someone
coming
to
the
cftc
and
saying
you
know
you
have
a
contract
listed
on
an
election
in
x
district
in
y
state
and
we
believe
there
was
fraud
because
of
hardware
software
news
you
name
it
you
need
to
police
that
fraud
so
without
being
too
indirect
what
i
trying
to
say
is
the
cftc
could
end
up
being
an
election
cop
and
i
do
think
that
what
congress
meant
or
intended
for
us
to
do
1
i
agree
with
these
statements
it
would
not
be
in
the
public
interest
for
the
cftc
to
assume
the
role
of
election
cop
therefore
i
would
strongly
recommend
and
support
that
the
cftc
should
forbid
all
such
contracts
yours
sincerely
