while

we
believe
the
addition
of

to

will
reduce
both
the

and
the
public

of
the

kalshi
is
proposing
to
list
contracts
that
ask

since
its
launch
in
2014
predictit
prices
have
generated
significant
public
interest
these
prices
have
been
widely
cited
in
media
and
among
investment
analysts
often
as
an
alternative
to
polling
or
election
models
predictit

has
been
used
by
students
at
academics
at
over
130
universities
across
a
wide
range
of
subjects
including
microeconomics
political

and
game

predictit
tends
to
experience
heavy
website
traffic
as
election
results
are
reported
usually
far
in
excess
of
the
number
of
individuals
who
are
trading
contracts
this
indicates
that
the
public
sees
prediction
market
data
as
an
important
tool
in
understanding
election
results
which
are
often
unclear
and
even
misleading
as
individual
counties
across
the
country
report
partial
results
predictit
traders
for
example
had
priced
in
that
candidate
biden
was
likely
to
win
the
state
of
michigan
in

before

the

well
over
a

individuals
visited
predictit
during

of

far
in
excess
of
the
traders
allowed
to
hold
any
given
market
contract
under
the
terms
of
the
no

this
indicates
that
members
of
the
public
were
visiting
predictit
not
only
to
make
trades
but
also
to
see
how
the
market
was
reacting
to

it
came

recognition
as

fully
supports
the
effort
to
expand
the

of

aristotle
does
not
however
believe
that
such

need
to
be
limited
to

in

believes

kalshi

of

as

in
the
previous

these
accurate

serve
a
broader
societal

they
do
not
merely
serve
the
interests
of
traders
predictit
market
prices
receive
significant
attention
from
the

political
actors
and
investors
this
is
precisely
because
over
time
political
prediction
markets
have
built
a
reputation
for
accurately
reflecting
the
probability
that
a
candidate
or
party
will
win
an

the
ease
of

to

low

these

while

see

a

as

these
inherently

which
are
critical
in
political
prediction

underscore
the
need
to
maintain
a

on

kalshi
proposed

would
limit

to

multiples
of

per

this
minimum
position
limit
is
explicitly
designed
to
limit
access
to
wealthy
individuals
and
large
institutions
the
market
composition
would
look
very
different
to
that
of
predictit
so
long
as
a

is

above

the

the

whether
there
are

economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of

that
can
not
be
hedged
using
existing

this
suggested
test
is
unreasonably
restrictive
almost
no
innovative
financial
derivative
would
be
allowed
under
this
test
since
there
are
almost
always
more
or
less
perfect
substitutes
for
economic
transactions
there
clearly
are
economic
risks
that
can
usefully
and
efficiently
be
hedged
by
political

contracts
since
the
end
of
the
vietnam
war
defense
spending
has
risen
as
a
percent
of

during
republican
presidential
administrations
and
fallen
during
democratic
administrations
see
an
economic
dynamic
spanning
50
years
is
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
to
serve
a
hedging
function
thus
defense
contractors
or
investors
holding
shares
of
those
companies
could
hedge

the

that

somehow
undermine

on

appears
to
be
based
on
a
misunderstanding
of
the
federal

rule
that
rule
comes
into
effect
when
there
are
among
other
factors
communications
between
a
campaign
and
a
pac
or
other
outside
spender
political
event
contracts
neither
involve
nor
facilitate
contact
between
campaigns
and
other
entities
so
those
contracts
can
not
play
a
role
in
circumventing
the
fec
coordination
rule
in
a
large
liquid
market
political
event
contracts
could
not
be
used
successfully
to
manipulate
perceptions
of
likely
success
fundraising
or
voting
the
only
cited
example
of
manipulation
of
perceptions
is
the
romney
whale
who
traded
on
the
intrade
market
the
romney
trader
was
able
to
generate
a
small
temporary
spike
in
romney
support
numbers
only
because
the
intrade
market
was
small
and
shallow
even
in
that
case
most
of
the
bump
caused
by
the
trader
large
positions
was
arbitraged
away
fairly
quickly
in
a
large
and
liquid
market
which
would
be
made
possible
by
cftc
approval
it
would
be
financially
impossible
for
a
single
trader
or
even
a
group
of
wealthy
traders
to
manipulate
prices
because
arbitragers
and
traders
holding
contrary
opinions
would
be
ready
and
able
to
counter
inflated
offers
the
primary
alternative
to
prediction
markets
as
a
source
of
pre
election
outcome
forecasts
is
public
opinion
polls
in
contrast
to
the
barriers
to
manipulation
in
well

liquid

public

are
routinely
used
with
the
express
intent
of
manipulating

of

for
instance

designed
and
intended
to
spread

about

rather
than

efforts
to

are

thus
the

not

not
lead
to
the

posits

the

prediction

though

the
