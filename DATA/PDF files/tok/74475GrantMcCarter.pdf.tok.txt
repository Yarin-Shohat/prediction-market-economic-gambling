i
am
writing
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
proposed
rule
on
event
contracts
i
believe
the
proposal
is
flawed
for
several
reasons
which
i
want
to
outline
below
overly
broad
definition
of
gaming
the
proposed
rule
definition
of
gaming
is
excessively
broad
and
risks
restricting
legitimate
contracts
from
being
listed
for
trading
by
categorizing
a
wide
array
of
activities
under
the
term
gaming
including
political
contests
and
athletic
events
the
proposal
could
inadvertently
stifle
innovation
and
limit
the
availability
of
contracts
that
have
significant
commercial
value
and
utility
the
broad
scope
of
this
definition
fails
to
consider
the
legitimate
economic
purposes
that
such
contracts
may
serve
potentially
hindering
market
participants
from
engaging
in
beneficial
trading
activities
the
cftc
definition
of
gaming
includes
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
outcomes
related
to
contests
games
involving
skill
or
chance
and
other
occurrences
connected
to
such
events
this
expansive
interpretation
could
lead
to
the
exclusion
of
contracts
that
are
not
inherently
speculative
or
harmful
but
rather
serve
as
valuable
tools
for
hedging
and
risk
management
in
various
sectors
for
instance
contracts
based
on
political
events
or
sports
outcomes
could
provide
market
participants
with
opportunities
to
hedge
against
uncertainties
in
these
areas
which
is
a
legitimate
economic
activity
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
criteria
were
used
to
determine
the
inclusion
of
certain
activities
under
the
definition
of
gaming
and
how
do
these
criteria
align
with
the
economic
purposes
these
contracts
may
serve
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
differentiate
between
contracts
that
are
genuinely
speculative
or
harmful
and
those
that
serve
legitimate
hedging
or
risk
management
purposes
3
what
measures
will
the
cftc
implement
to
ensure
that
the
definition
of
gaming
does
not
inadvertently
stifle
innovation
or
limit
the
development
of
contracts
that
could
benefit
the
market
and
its
participants
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
contracts
that
would
be
considered
legitimate
under
the
proposed
rule
to
clarify
the
boundaries
of
the
gaming
definition
by
addressing
these
questions
the
cftc
can
provide
greater
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
supports
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restricting
beneficial
trading
activities
arbitrary
and
capricious
public
interest
consideration
the
cftc
proposal
on
event
contracts
introduces
a
problematic
approach
to
public
interest
consideration
by
prohibiting
contracts
based
on
a
predetermined
finding
that
they
are
against
the
public
interest
without
a
thorough
review
of
their
actual
terms
this
blanket
prohibition
on
contracts
involving
certain
activities
such
as
gaming
war
or
terrorism
creates
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
regulatory
environment
by
not
allowing
for
a
case
by
case
analysis
of
the
specific
terms
and
economic
implications
of
each
contract
the
rule
could
lead
to
unjust
outcomes
and
deter
market
participants
from
proposing
or
listing
event
contracts
that
might
otherwise
be
beneficial
the
proposal
stipulates
that
contracts
involving
certain
enumerated
activities
are
categorically
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
prohibited
from
trading
or
clearing
on
cftc
registered
derivatives
exchanges
this
approach
introduces
significant
uncertainty
for
exchanges
and
market
participants
as
it
does
not
account
for
the
specific
economic
purpose
or
pricing
utility
of
individual
contracts
the
cftc
rationale
is
to
reduce
the
internal
resources
devoted
to
reviewing
event
contracts
but
this
comes
at
the
cost
of
potentially
stifling
innovation
and
limiting
market
opportunities
the
categorical
prohibition
without
a
detailed
analysis
of
each
contract
terms
and
implications
can
lead
to
outcomes
that
are
not
aligned
with
the
actual
risks
or
benefits
posed
by
these
contracts
this
approach
may
also
discourage
market
participants
from
proposing
new
contracts
due
to
the
regulatory
risk
and
uncertainty
introduced
by
such
broad
prohibitions
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
criteria
and
rationale
does
the
cftc
use
to
determine
that
certain
categories
of
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
without
reviewing
the
specific
terms
of
each
contract
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
approach
does
not
inadvertently
deter
beneficial
contracts
that
serve
legitimate
hedging
or
risk
management
purposes
3
what
mechanisms
if
any
will
the
cftc
implement
to
allow
for
a
case
by
case
review
of
contracts
that
fall
under
the
enumerated
activities
to
avoid
arbitrary
and
capricious
outcomes
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
contracts
that
would
be
considered
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
proposed
rule
and
explain
the
reasoning
behind
these
determinations
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
the
need
to
reduce
internal
resource
allocation
with
the
need
to
foster
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
that
supports
innovation
and
economic
growth
by
addressing
these
questions
the
cftc
can
provide
greater
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
supports
a
balanced
and
effective
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restricting
beneficial
trading
activities
lack
of
clear
public
interest
factors
the
cftc
proposal
lacks
clear
public
interest
factors
that
would
determine
whether
a
contract
is
considered
against
the
public
interest
this
absence
of
transparency
and
specificity
in
the
rulemaking
process
leaves
market
participants
uncertain
about
the
criteria
used
to
evaluate
contracts
without
well
defined
factors
the
rule
introduces
unnecessary
regulatory
risk
and
uncertainty
which
can
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
development
and
listing
of
event
contracts
market
participants
need
clear
guidance
to
understand
how
their
contracts
will
be
assessed
and
to
ensure
compliance
with
regulatory
standards
the
proposal
mentions
several
factors
that
the
cftc
may
consider
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
as
the
contract
utility
for
hedging
and
price
basing
purposes
its
potential
impact
on
the
public
good
and
whether
it
involves
activities
deemed
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
however
these
factors
are
not
clearly
defined
or
consistently
applied
leading
to
ambiguity
for
instance
the
cftc
has
historically
used
an
economic
purpose
test
to
evaluate
contracts
but
this
was
removed
by
congress
and
there
is
no
longer
a
statutory
requirement
for
contracts
to
meet
a
hedging
or
price
basing
standard
the
lack
of
clear
guidelines
leaves
market
participants
guessing
about
how
their
contracts
will
be
judged
which
could
deter
innovation
and
the
introduction
of
potentially
beneficial
contracts
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
public
interest
factors
will
the
cftc
use
to
evaluate
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
how
will
these
factors
be
consistently
applied
across
different
types
of
contracts
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
the
evaluation
process
is
transparent
and
provides
sufficient
guidance
to
market
participants
about
the
criteria
used
in
determining
the
public
interest
3
will
the
cftc
consider
reinstating
the
economic
purpose
test
or
similar
criteria
to
provide
a
more
structured
framework
for
assessing
the
public
interest
of
contracts
and
if
not
why
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
contracts
that
have
been
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
proposed
rule
and
explain
the
specific
factors
that
led
to
these
determinations
5
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participants
and
gather
feedback
on
the
public
interest
factors
potentially
through
roundtables
or
public
consultations
to
ensure
that
the
rule
supports
a
fair
and
efficient
market
environment
now
i
want
to
make
clear
the
benefits
of
these
markets
that
the
cftc
overlooks
in
their
proposal
hedging
use
cases
the
cftc
proposed
rule
on
event
contracts
particularly
those
related
to
elections
poses
significant
challenges
to
the
legitimate
hedging
use
cases
that
these
contracts
provide
event
contracts
offer
a
vital
mechanism
for
businesses
and
individuals
to
hedge
against
uncertainties
associated
with
elections
which
have
profound
impacts
on
economic
and
regulatory
environments
the
ability
to
hedge
these
risks
is
crucial
for
effective
risk
management
by
prohibiting
such
contracts
the
cftc
inadvertently
pushes
market
participants
towards
unregulated
and
potentially
illegal
platforms
like
polymarket
a
regulated
market
provides
transparency
security
and
oversight
ensuring
that
hedging
activities
are
conducted
within
a
safe
and
compliant
framework
the
cftc
should
focus
on
creating
a
robust
regulatory
environment
that
allows
these
contracts
to
be
traded
legally
and
transparently
rather
than
driving
them
underground
the
cftc
current
stance
as
reflected
in
recent
orders
and
discussions
suggests
that
event
contracts
related
to
elections
do
not
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
due
to
their
binary
nature
and
the
unpredictability
of
election
outcomes
however
this
perspective
overlooks
the
broader
economic
impacts
that
election
results
can
have
affecting
industries
markets
and
individual
financial
positions
market
participants
such
as
media
companies
and
consultancies
may
find
significant
value
in
hedging
against
the
direct
risks
stemming
from
electoral
outcomes
the
cftc
role
should
not
be
to
deny
market
participants
the
choice
of
financial
products
that
meet
their
hedging
needs
simply
because
they
are
deemed
not
effective
enough
by
the
commission
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
criteria
does
the
cftc
use
to
determine
the
hedging
utility
of
event
contracts
and
how
does
it
account
for
the
broader
economic
impacts
of
election
outcomes
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
approach
does
not
inadvertently
push
market
participants
towards
unregulated
platforms
thereby
increasing
systemic
risk
3
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participants
to
better
understand
their
hedging
needs
and
the
potential
utility
of
event
contracts
in
meeting
those
needs
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
event
contracts
that
have
been
deemed
to
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
and
explain
the
rationale
behind
these
determinations
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
its
concerns
about
the
commoditization
of
the
electoral
process
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participants
with
legitimate
hedging
tools
forecasting
and
data
the
data
generated
from
prediction
markets
is
invaluable
and
often
more
accurate
than
traditional
polling
methods
numerous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
prediction
markets
offer
unbiased
and
reliable
forecasts
making
them
a
superior
tool
for
anticipating
future
events
this
market
based
price
discovery
is
crucial
for
businesses
and
individuals
who
rely
on
accurate
forecasts
to
make
informed
decisions
by
restricting
event
contracts
the
cftc
is
limiting
access
to
this
valuable
data
which
could
otherwise
enhance
decision
making
processes
across
various
sectors
the
commission
should
recognize
the
importance
of
these
markets
in
providing
high
quality
data
and
consider
how
they
can
be
regulated
to
maximize
their
utility
prediction
markets
have
consistently
shown
their
ability
to
aggregate
diverse
information
and
opinions
into
a
single
market
based
forecast
that
often
surpasses
the
accuracy
of
conventional
methods
like
opinion
polls
the
mechanism
of
trading
contracts
based
on
the
likelihood
of
future
events
creates
a
financial
incentive
for
participants
to
leverage
all
available
information
resulting
in
a
more
accurate
and
unbiased
forecast
this
is
particularly
valuable
in
areas
such
as
elections
where
traditional
polling
can
be
subject
to
biases
and
inaccuracies
the
insights
gained
from
prediction
markets
can
inform
strategic
decisions
in
business
policy
making
and
risk
management
providing
a
competitive
edge
to
those
who
utilize
this
data
effectively
the
cftc
proposal
to
restrict
event
contracts
including
those
related
to
political
events
undermines
the
potential
benefits
of
these
markets
the
commission
concerns
about
the
speculative
nature
of
these
contracts
and
the
potential
for
market
manipulation
should
be
addressed
through
robust
regulatory
frameworks
rather
than
outright
bans
proper
regulation
can
ensure
that
prediction
markets
operate
transparently
and
fairly
maintaining
their
integrity
while
providing
valuable
data
to
market
participants
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
evidence
does
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
position
that
prediction
markets
do
not
provide
valuable
and
reliable
data
and
how
does
this
compare
to
the
extensive
research
demonstrating
their
forecasting
accuracy
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
balance
its
concerns
about
speculation
and
market
manipulation
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participants
access
to
high
quality
market
based
data
3
what
regulatory
measures
can
the
cftc
implement
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
prediction
markets
while
allowing
them
to
operate
and
provide
valuable
data
to
businesses
and
individuals
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
successful
regulatory
frameworks
from
other
jurisdictions
that
have
effectively
managed
the
risks
associated
with
prediction
markets
5
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
academic
researchers
and
industry
experts
to
better
understand
the
value
and
potential
of
prediction
markets
in
providing
accurate
forecasts
cftc
arguments
against
event
contracts
the
cftc
arguments
against
event
contracts
lack
empirical
support
and
are
based
on
broad
generalizations
the
assertion
that
the
cftc
does
not
want
to
become
an
election
cop
does
not
justify
a
blanket
ban
on
these
markets
instead
of
prohibiting
event
contracts
the
cftc
should
engage
in
the
hard
work
of
developing
a
regulatory
framework
that
addresses
its
concerns
while
allowing
these
markets
to
operate
this
would
involve
setting
clear
guidelines
and
standards
to
ensure
that
event
contracts
are
used
responsibly
and
do
not
undermine
public
interest
a
ban
is
a
simplistic
solution
that
fails
to
address
the
complexities
of
the
issue
and
overlooks
the
potential
benefits
of
a
well
regulated
market
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
accommodate
the
legitimate
hedging
needs
of
businesses
and
individuals
if
event
contracts
are
prohibited
2
what
specific
data
or
research
supports
the
cftc
position
that
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
how
does
this
compare
to
the
extensive
research
demonstrating
their
forecasting
accuracy
3
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
approach
does
not
inadvertently
push
market
participants
towards
unregulated
platforms
thereby
increasing
systemic
risk
4
how
can
the
cftc
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
allows
event
contracts
to
be
traded
in
a
manner
that
addresses
public
interest
concerns
without
resorting
to
a
complete
prohibition
i
ask
that
the
cftc
return
answers
to
questions
before
moving
forward
with
this
significantly
broad
proposal
sincerely
grant
