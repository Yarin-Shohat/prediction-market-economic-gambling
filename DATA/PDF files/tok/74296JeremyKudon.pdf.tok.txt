appreciates
the
opportunity
to
submit
public
comment
on

af14
which
concerns
the
types
of
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
and
would
classify
contracts
involving
gaming
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
sba
is
a
coalition
of
the
leading
sports
betting
operators
in
the
united
states
including
betmgm
draftkings
fanatics
and
fanduel
although
sba
members
are
competitors
in
the
marketplace
we
are
united
in
our
commitment
to
working
with
federal
state
and
tribal
governments
to
create
a
viable
successful
and
safe
sports
wagering
industry
given
our
collective
expertise
and
investment
in
this
industry
we
find
it
imperative
to
comment
on
the
proposed
rule
and
respectfully
object
to
the
commission
proposed
determination
that
any
contracts
that
involve
gaming
are
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
rule
in
question
was
enacted
at
a
time
when
the
professional
and
amateur
sports
protection
act
paspa
forbade
states
from
legalizing
sports
betting
however
in

the
supreme
court
overturned
paspa
as
unconstitutional
since
paspa
repeal
in
2018
more
than
38
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
and
puerto
rico
have
legalized
and
regulated
sports
wagering
this
has
led
to
the
development
of
a
strictly
regulated
yet
thriving
industry
that
provides
consumers
with
legal
protections
combats
offshore
and
unregulated
operators
and
supports
local
economies
through
tax
revenue
and
job
creation
today
more
than
two
thirds
of
american
adults
live
in
a
legal
and
operational
sports
betting
jurisdiction
with
more
states
likely
to
follow
suit
the
widespread
impact
and
prevalence
of
the
sports
wagering
industry
across
nearly
40
states
and
jurisdictions
underscore
the
critical
importance
of
maintaining
the
stability
of
its
operators
and
overall
ecosystem
to
that
end
the
sba
makes
three
requests
regarding
the
proposed
rule
first
the
sba
respectfully
requests
that
the
cftc
clarify
that
the
proposed
rule
is
not
intended
to
conflict
with
gaming
activity
regulated
by
the
states
in
order
to
prevent
any
potential
destabilization
of
state
regulated
sports
betting
second
the
cftc
should
confirm
that
gaming
itself
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
demonstrated
by
the
widespread
adoption
of
the
activity
across
the
country
third
and
finally
the
commission
should
allow
for
an
institutional
futures
market
accessible
to
licensed
sports
betting
operators
currently
the
proposed
rule
overlooks
the
compelling
economic
purpose
that
an
institutional
futures
market
could
serve
in
allowing
operators
to
hedge
commercial
risks
labeling
any
contracts
involving
gaming
as
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
will
limit
the
industry
hedging
ability
a
move
that
we
believe
has
not
been
sufficiently
considered
by
the
cftc
we
object
to
the
proposed
rule
to
the
extent
it
forecloses
an
institutional
futures
market
for
this
purpose
we
strongly
advocate
for
meaningful
discussions
between
our
members
other
relevant
companies
within
the
sports
wagering
and
sports
industries
and
the
cftc
these
discussions
are
essential
to
address
the
complexities
of
the
industry
and
ensure
that
any
regulatory
measures
are
well
informed
and
balanced
such
collaborative
engagement
should
precede
the
enactment
of
broad
and
categorical
rules
that
may
have
far
reaching
implications
we
respectfully
urge
the
cftc
to
refrain
from
approving
this
rule
in
its
current
form
due
to
its
unconditional
nature
and
its
potential
harm
to
a
multi
billion
dollar
industry
and
the
tens
of
millions
of
consumers
that
currently
enjoy
legal
regulated
betting
on
sporting
events
we
believe
that
with
further
examination
and
open
dialogue
a
more
nuanced
approach
can
be
developed
that
safeguards
the
public
interest
while
supporting
the
stability
and
growth
of
the
regulated
sports
betting
industry
thank
you
for
considering
our
comments
we
look
forward
to
the
opportunity
to
engage
in
constructive
discussions
with
the
commission
on
this
critical
issue
sincerely
