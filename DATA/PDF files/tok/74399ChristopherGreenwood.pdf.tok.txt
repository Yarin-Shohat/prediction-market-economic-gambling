trade
republic
mission
is
to
empower
all
europeans
for
wealth
creation
through
easy
secure
free
access
to
capital
markets
we
aim
to
achieve
this
by
building
simple
easy
to
use
banking
products
such
as
stock
etf
trading
we
are
writing
to
support
kalshi
on
their
mission
to
democratize
election
markets
financial
empowerment
includes
not
only
savings
and
retirement
planning
but
also
risk
management
election
hedging
vehicles
are
today
mostly
available
to
high
net
worth
investors
big
financial
institutions
have
entire
departments
that
advise
their
clients
about
how
to
manage
election
risk
however
retail
investors
are
just
as
exposed
to
the
risks
related
to

clients
are
trade
republic
strives
to
democratize
capital
markets
by
making
those
types
of
economic
tools
accessible
for
the
masses
as
we
see
that
people
are
becoming
increasingly
empowered
to
take
control
over
their
financial
lives
by
analyzing
the
investing
behavior
of
our
customers
we
see
that
retail
investors
are
capable
of
understanding
their
own
risk
needs
we
therefore
believe
that
contracts
that
can
hedge
election
outcomes
and
manage
exposures
can
also
be
a
useful
asset
category
for
retail
investors
and
should
be
considered
by
the
regulator
