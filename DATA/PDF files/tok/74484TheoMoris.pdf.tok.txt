dear
cftc
commissioners
i
am
writing
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
cftc
recent
proposal
to
ban
election
contracts
and
to
highlight
the
vital
benefits
that
such
contracts
offer
as
well
as
to
critique
the
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definitions
that
underpin
this
proposal
1
hedging
value
of
election
contracts
election
contracts
provide
essential
hedging
opportunities
for
a
diverse
array
of
market
participants
political
events
particularly
elections
can
introduce
significant
uncertainty
and
volatility
into
financial
markets
for
businesses
and
investors
election
outcomes
can
have
profound
implications
on
economic
policies
regulatory
environments
and
market
conditions
election
contracts
offer
a
mechanism
to
manage
this
uncertainty
by
allowing
participants
to
hedge
against
potential
adverse
impacts
for
instance
multinational
corporations
operating
across
different
political
environments
can
use
election
contracts
to
mitigate
risks
associated
with
sudden
policy
shifts
or
regulatory
changes
following
an
election
similarly
investors
who
are
concerned
about
potential
market
volatility
in
the
wake
of
an
election
can
use
these
contracts
to
stabilize
their
portfolios
by
allowing
market
participants
to
better
manage
their
risks
election
contracts
contribute
to
market
stability
and
efficiency
2
price
basing
value
forecasts
and
data
election
contracts
also
provide
invaluable
information
through
their
pricing
the
market
prices
of
these
contracts
serve
as
a
barometer
of
public
sentiment
and
expectations
regarding
election
outcomes
this
price
based
information
is
a
valuable
complement
to
traditional
opinion
polls
and
forecasts
the
transparency
of
election
markets
offers
insights
into
how
different
segments
of
the
population
are
likely
to
vote
and
how
they
perceive
the
likelihood
of
various
outcomes
this
data
is
not
merely
speculative
it
reflects
the
aggregated
views
of
informed
participants
who
have
significant
stakes
in
the
outcomes
such
information
enhances
the
robustness
of
political
forecasts
and
can
help
media
analysts
and
policymakers
better
understand
and
anticipate
electoral
trends
by
banning
these
contracts
the
cftc
risks
depriving
the
public
and
decision
makers
of
a
crucial
data
point
that
aids
in
making
more
informed
decisions
the
predictive
value
of
election
contracts
should
not
be
underestimated
they
represent
a
diverse
and
dynamic
source
of
information
that
can
enhance
the
overall
quality
of
political
forecasting
3
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definitions
the
process
by
which
the
cftc
has
approached
this
proposal
raises
serious
concerns
the
decision
to
ban
election
contracts
appears
to
have
been
made
without
a
thorough
examination
of
the
empirical
evidence
regarding
their
impact
on
markets
and
their
utility
for
hedging
there
has
been
insufficient
engagement
with
stakeholders
who
rely
on
these
contracts
for
legitimate
purposes
and
a
lack
of
comprehensive
data
analysis
to
justify
such
a
sweeping
ban
moreover
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
is
excessively
broad
and
fails
to
distinguish
between
legitimate
market
activities
and
those
that
may
pose
actual
risks
the
characterization
of
election
contracts
as
inherently
problematic
conflates
different
types
of
market
activities
and
overlooks
the
positive
role
these
contracts
play
in
providing
price
discovery
and
risk
management
the
cftc
proposal
seems
to
misinterpret
or
overextend
the
concept
of
gaming
to
include
all
forms
of
speculation
in
election
markets
this
overly
broad
definition
undermines
the
nuanced
understanding
required
to
regulate
these
markets
effectively
it
fails
to
acknowledge
that
election
contracts
when
properly
regulated
can
coexist
with
market
integrity
and
offer
significant
value
to
participants

evidence
and

specific
empirical
evidence

these
contracts
have
played
a
crucial
role
in
risk
management
for
businesses
or
investors

mechanisms
does
the
cftc
propose
for
market
participants
who
currently
use
election
contracts
for
hedging
against
political
uncertainty
price
discovery
and
forecasting
what
is
the
cftc
evaluation
of
the
role
that
election
contracts
play
in
providing
price
based
information
and
enhancing
political
forecasts
how
does
the
cftc
propose
to
replace
or
supplement
the
predictive
value
offered
by
election
contracts
if
they
are
banned
definition
of
gaming
can
the
cftc
clarify
the
specific
criteria
used
to
define
gaming
in
the
context
of
election
contracts
how
does
this
definition
align
with
the
actual
activities
observed
in
these
markets
how
does
the
cftc
differentiate
between
speculative
activities
that
are
considered
problematic
and
those
that
are

the
cftc
conducted
a
thorough
assessment
of
the
potential
economic
and
informational
impacts
of
banning
election
contracts
on
markets
and
market
participants
what
are
the
anticipated
consequences

efficiency

stakeholder
interests
if
the

what
other

has
the
cftc
considered
that
could
address
any
identified
risks
associated
with

contracts
without
implementing
a
complete
ban
is
the
cftc
open
to
exploring
regulatory
frameworks
that
allow
for
the
continuation
of
election
contracts
under
stricter
oversight
or

how
does
the
cftc
ensure

are
in

and

to
election
contracts
to
ensure
they

dynamics
and

needs
5
conclusion
in
conclusion
i
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
to
ban
election
contracts
these
contracts
offer
essential
hedging
tools
provide
valuable
price
based
information
and
support
market
stability
the
flawed
process
and
overly
broad
definitions
employed
in
the
proposal
detract
from
a
balanced
and
well
informed
regulatory
approach
a
more
nuanced
examination
of
the
role
and
impact
of
election
contracts
combined
with
stakeholder
engagement
and
empirical
analysis
is
necessary
to
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
protects
market
integrity
while
allowing
beneficial
market
activities
to
thrive
thank
you
for
considering
my
perspective
on
this
important
issue
