kalshiex
request
for
approval
of
political
futures
contracts
dear
cftc
in
summary
the
kalshiex
contracts
are
in
the
public
interest
and
should
be
approved
without
delay
the
current
cftc
should
have
the
courage
to
correct
the
decade
old
nadex
mistake
from
a
previous
set
of
commissioners
and
approve
these
contracts
elections
have
economic
consequences
the
contracts
can
be
used
by
those
exposed
to
energy
and
tax
policy
to
hedge
the
contracts
serve
a
public
purpose
of
information
production
and
are
likely
to
be
better
than
polls
the
contracts
pose
no
risk
of
undermining
election
integrity
the
long
standing
existence
of
academic
prediction
markets
with
zero
criminal
sanctions
is
a
de
facto
demonstration
that
such
markets
are
legal
even
if
one
could
construe
this
as
gaming
the
cftc
should
use
its
exemptive
authority
to
approve
the
contracts
because
they
are
in
the
public
interest
the
cftc
should
approve
these
contracts
immediately
and
not
wait
until
october
background
many
years
ago
a
previous
set
of
cftc
commissioners
incorrectly
said
no
to
a
nadex
request
to
trade
election
futures
contracts
on
the
grounds
that
such
contracts
were
gaming
and
thus
illegal
now
kalshi
is
seeking
to
trade
contracts
that
would
allow
users
to
speculate
on
or
hedge
on
the
results
of
elections
the
cftc
is
requesting
comment
on
various
questions
related
to
these
contracts
mostly
related
to
whether
or
not
the
proposed
contracts
are
related
to
gaming
the
supreme
court
is
not
hung
up
on
stare
decisis
and
the
cftc
should
not
be
either
as
the
recent
overturning
of
roe
v
wade
indicates
the
supreme
court
is
willing
to
overturn
precedents
when
a
majority
of
the
justices
feel
a
mistake
has
been
made
today
commissioners
of
the
cftc
should
also
have
the
courage
to
undo
the
previous
mistake
that
was
made
in
denying
election
based
contracts
yes
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
does
provide
important
predictability
and
stability
in
law
and
rulemaking
however
with
a
decade
of
additional
consideration
it
is
now
clearer
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
allow
these
contracts
to
exist
the
current
cftc
commissioners
should
not
feel
bound
by
an
incorrect
precedent
made
by
a
previous
generation
of
commissioners
elections
have
consequences
and
election
contracts
can
provide
a
means
to
hedge
them
we
live
in
a
politically
polarized
world
the
two
major
parties
have
very
different
policy
objectives
election
outcomes
can
have
a
huge
impact
on
the
economic
success
or
failure
of
an
enterprise
for
example
one
party
wants
to
promote
clean
energy
and
the
other
party
wants
to
promote
carbon
based
fuels
those
with
exposure
to
fossil
fuels
or
to
green
energy
companies
might
want
to
hedge
their
exposure
with
the
proposed
contracts
the
different
parties
also
have
very
different
ideas
on
tax
policy
and
once
again
individuals
and
corporations
might
want
to
hedge
with
these
contracts
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
provide
these
hedging
tools
it
remains
to
be
seen
how
much
liquidity
these
contracts
will
have
which
will
affect
their
fitness
of
purpose
for
hedging
even
if
the
contracts
are
not
big
enough
for
exxon
to
use
for
hedging
they
will
still
have
serious
utility
for
smaller
investors
the
cftc
should
let
it
up
to
the
dcms
to
design
and
self
certify
the
contracts
and
restrain
from
the
urge
to
micromanage
contract
design
the
dcms
have
the
incentive
to
get
it
right
and
the
cftc
should
allow
them
to
experiment
in
each
election
cycle
better
information
about
likely
election
outcomes
is
in
the
public
interest
it
is
no
secret
that
public
opinion
polls
have
become
less
trusted
in
recent
years
as
people
are
less
likely
to
answer
the
phone
see
nevertheless
there
is
a
large
hunger
for
information
about
what
voters
are
likely
to
do
better
information
can
help
candidates
and
parties
better
allocate
their
campaign
resources
better
information
can
also
help
voters
make
voting
and
donating
decisions
better
information
can
allow
the
media
to
make
more
informed
decisions
about
how
to
cover
candidates
for
example
access
to
the
platform
of
a
political
debate
has
been
based
on
poll
numbers
see
with
better
information
from
prediction
markets
better
decisions
can
be
made
the
information
that
an
election
is
close
can
increase
voter
interest
and
turnout
thus
increasing
voter
engagement
in
the
election
process
similarly
the
real
time
nature
of
prediction
markets
can
give
voters
and
candidates
nearly
instant
information
about
the
impact
of
various
events
on
a
campaign
such
an
improvement
in
information
is
in
the
public
interest
markets
can
do
a
better
job
than
pollsters
because
of
their
inherent
financial
incentives
potential
voters
have
no
incentive
to
answer
a
call
from
a
pollster
or
even
tell
the
truth
about
their
voting
intentions
this
adds
a
large
amount
of
uncertainty
to
poll
results
markets
on
the
other
hand
provide
a
strong
financial
incentive
for
people
to
put
their
money
where
their
information
is
profit
driven
players
will
use
all
of
the
information
at
their
disposal
to
make
good
trading
decisions
and
this
allows
markets
to
aggregate
all
of
the
information
that
is
available
this
means
that
election
markets
are
likely
to
provide
more
accurate
forecasts
than
polls
better
information
can
improve
election
integrity
conspiracy
theories
often
fly
when
election
results
differ
from
pre
election
polls
voters
rightly
ask
how
did
my
candidate
lose
when
they
were
leading
in
the
polls
with
better
forecasts
of
likely
outcomes
voters
are
more
likely
to
accept
the
final
election
results
as
the
election
markets
aggregate
all
of
the
available
information
they
are
likely
to
provide
more
accurate
forecasts
of
the
final
results
and
thus
help
to
assure
voters
of
the
integrity
of
the
election
process
there
is
no
financial
incentive
to
manipulate
a
regulated
prediction
market
to
change
the
election
outcome
one
concern
is
whether
bad
actors
might
attempt
to
manipulate
a
prediction
market
in
order
to
create
momentum
for
their
candidate
and
influence
the
election
that
would
be
a
stupid
thing
for
anyone
to
do
given
the
highly
regulated
nature
of
cftc
regulated
exchanges
the
existence
of
a
high
quality
audit
trail
makes
it
very
easy
to
identify
any
such
manipulation
it
would
be
far
more
cost
effective
for
a
manipulator
to
hire
an
army
of
social
media
bots
than
to
attempt
to
manipulate
an
election
via
a
prediction
market
the
longstanding
existence
of
various
election
prediction
markets
is
de
facto
evidence
that
such
markets
are
not
illegal
gaming
prediction
markets
have
existed
for
many
years
that
harness
market
forces
to
predict
election
outcomes
for
example
the
iowa
electronic
markets
have
been
in
operation
for
over
30
years
see
another
example
is
the
long
standing
operation
of
such
election
prediction
markets
is
strong
evidence
that
election
based
prediction
markets
are
not
illegal
under
state
of
federal
law
elections
are
not
chance
events
gambling
typically
involves
some
outcome
that
is
essentially
random
and
upon
which
the
rules
of
probability
apply
examples
include
the
spin
of
a
roulette
wheel
the
roll
of
dice
or
the
drawing
of
a
card
from
a
well
shuffled
deck
such
random
activities
provide
little
if
any
economic
benefit
beyond
entertainment
due
to
the
damage
that
compulsive
gamblers
do
to
themselves
and
others
gambling
is
highly
restricted
or
regulated
in
most
jurisdictions
elections
on
the
other
hand
are
not
based
on
random
draws
one
exception
is
in
the
extremely
rare
case
of
a
tie
in
some
jurisdictions
a
random
process
can
be
used
to
break
the
tie
for
an
example
see
they
are
the
bedrock
of
our
political
process
and
have
an
important
economic
purpose
elections
select
the
leaders
who
will
be
making
the
important
policy
decisions
that
affect
the
economy
uncertainty
is
not
the
same
as
gambling
the
outcomes
of
political
elections
like
future
weather
patterns
future
crop
prices
and
future
metal
prices
are
highly
uncertain
the
mere
fact
that
an
outcome
is
uncertain
does
not
mean
that
an
economic
transaction
tied
to
that
uncertain
outcome
is
illegal
gaming
if
that
were
the
case
then
all
futures
contracts
would
be
connected
to
gaming
and
hence
illegal
even
if
these
contracts
could
be
construed
as
gaming
the
cftc
should
use
its
exemptive
authority
to
approve
these
contracts
as
in
the
public
interest
while
these
contracts
are
certainly
not
the
type
of
gaming
congress
envisioned
in
writing
the
prohibition
in
section
of
the
cea
one
can
see
how
some
might
think
so
fortunately
congress
has
given
the
cftc
pretty
broad
exemptive
authority
to
act
in
the
public
interest
see
17
cfr
requests
for
exemptive
no
action
and
interpretative
letters
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
a
serious
court
challenge
would
occur
if
the
cftc
approves
these
contracts
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
approve
these
contracts
and
the
cftc
should
do
so
without
delay
given
the
rapidly
approaching
elections
the
cftc
should
approve
the
contracts
immediately
and
not
wait
until
october
