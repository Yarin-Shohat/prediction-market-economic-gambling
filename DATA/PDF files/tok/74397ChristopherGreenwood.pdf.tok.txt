my
name
is
robin
hanson
and
i
an
associate
professor
of
economics
at
george
mason
university
and
a
research
associate
at
the
future
of
humanity
institute
of
oxford
university
i
been
writing
about
prediction
markets
since
1988
and
was
the
first
to
write
on
their
potential
for
widespread
applications
i
have
since
been
involved
in
many
related
projects
both
academic
and
practical
and
have
originated
key
technologies
for
market
making
and
combinatorial
trading
and
have
studied
many
kinds
of
foul
play
including
price
manipulation
i
write
to
support
kalshi
proposal
to
list
contracts
on
election
outcomes
i
have
two
arguments
regarding
the
short
and
the
long
term
in
the
short
term
these
markets
offer
concrete
social
benefits
plausibly
much
larger
than
any
social
harms
on
the
benefit
side
prediction
markets
allow
traders
to
hedge
their
portfolio
risks
and
offer
a
social
externality
benefit
to
the
world
via
the
information
in
their
prices
these
benefits
are
well
known
in
the
relevant
academic
literature
and
not
seriously
in
any
doubt
neither
the
hedging
nor
the
info
is
perfect
but
clearly
improves
on
the
situation
where
such
markets
are
absent
on
the
harm
side
there
might
in
theory
be
losses
from
people
who
might
make
more
risky
trades
than
are
good
for
them
or
who
might
sabotage
the
world
to
win
their
bets
price
manipulation
is
just
not
a
problem
in
such
markets
but
there
are
already
plenty
of
ways
to
make
risky
trades
so
it
is
hard
to
believe
adding
these
few
ways
makes
much
difference
there
and
the
world
already
contains
many
parties
with
strong
stakes
in
elections
making
it
hard
to
see
how
adding
some
modest
betting
stakes
would
make
much
difference
in
their
incentives
to
sabotage
however
i
actually
think
that
short
term
gains
here
are
small
compared
to
long
term
ones
there
are
a
great
many
promising
big
ways
in
which
prediction
markets
might
support
needed
reforms
and
institutional
innovations
and
i
have
been
writing
about
these
for
many
decades
but
legal
barriers
to
their
adoption
have
been
an
important
obstacle
to
pursuing
these
changes
so
i
see
big
gains
to
reducing
such
legal
barriers
as
we
are
unlikely
to
cut
such
barriers
all
at
once
we
should
instead
get
a
lot
more
practice
in
allowing
more
markets
watching
their
consequences
and
fine
tuning
our
approaches
and
regulations
to
adapt
to
any
perceived
problems
allowing
more
election
markets
seems
a
great
step
in
this
direction
