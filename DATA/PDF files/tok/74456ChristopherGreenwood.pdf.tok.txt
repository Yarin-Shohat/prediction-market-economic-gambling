1
do
these

regulation
and

of

an

they

not
please

should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as

books
whether
taking
a
position
on

or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
no
the
prohibition
is
not
whether

in
determining
whether
any
of
these
contracts
involves
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state

should
the

be
influenced
by
whether

permit
betting
on
the
outcome
of

political
outcomes
by
the
prohibition
of

no

is
