dear
chairman
behnam
we
are
writing
to
request
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
hold
a
public
roundtable
or
hearing
for
the
commission
proposed
amendments
to
commission
regulation
17

regarding
event
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
event
contracts

proposed

to
be
codified
at

pt

the
commission
proposed
rule
is
a
reinterpretation
of
longstanding
statutory
text
which
could
have
a
broad
impact
across
the
derivatives
industry
the
proposal
comes
during
a
significant
increase
in
new
event
contract
product
offerings
many
of
which
could
be
impacted
by
the
proposed
rule
on
matters
of
complexity
and
consequence
such
as
this
proposed
rule
the
commission
should
have
the
benefit
of
a
robust
public
discussion
and
a
diverse
and
full
record
the
proposal
seeks
to
define
a
broad
class
of
event
contracts
as
being
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
prohibited
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
whenever
the
commission
proposes
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
to
broadly
prohibit
otherwise
lawful
activities
the
commission
should
provide
the
public
with
sufficient
time
to
review
the
proposal
and
provide
feedback
similarly
the
commission
should
utilize
every
tool
at
its
disposal
to
fully
understand
the
implications
of
its
proposed
rule
to
that
end
we
strongly
encourage
the
cftc
to
hold
a
public
hearing
or
roundtable
to
solicit
further
feedback
education
and
discussion
on
event
contracts
as
has
been
suggested
by
members
of
the
commission
while
we
acknowledge
the
commission
has
extended
the
comment
period
to
august
8
2024
a
public
hearing
or
roundtable
will
provide
an
invaluable
forum
for
stakeholders
and
the
broader
public
to
discuss
and
understand
the
potential
implications
of
this
proposal
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
important
matter
sincerely
