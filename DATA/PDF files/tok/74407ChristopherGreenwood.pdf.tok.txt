including
as

for
several

i
also
sponsored
the
agency

advisory
committee
and
was
a
principal
of
the
financial
stability
oversight

during
this
time
the

and

i
am
writing
this
comment
to
support
designated
contract
markets
dcms
listing
event
contracts
based
on
partisan
control
of
congress
as
doing
so
would
provide
a
valuable
risk
management
tool
to
market
participants
as
well
as
promote
the
public
interest
in
2012
i
was
a
commissioner
of
the
cftc
when
another
dcm
nadex
submitted
several
contracts
on
political
control
including
control
of
congress
while
the
commission
voted
to
prohibit
them
at
that
time
see
here
conditions
have
changed
in
the
last
ten
years
and
the
concerns
the
commission
expressed
in
its
nadex
order
have
not
materialized
further
while
i
was
at
the
agency
in
2014
the
commission
issued
a
no
action
letter
to
victoria
university
of
wellington
to
operate
the
platform
now
known
as
predictit
for
the
last
eight
years
predictit
ran
a
successful
prediction
market
on
various
election
outcomes
with
no
observed
ill
effects
on
election
integrity
in
addition
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
these
contracts
are
clearer
now
than
they
were
in
2012
for
an
example

substantial
academic
research
investment
analysis
and
financial
institution
publications
have
addressed
how
contracts
like
these
can
be
used
both
for
hedging
purposes
and
as
the
basis
for
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
involving
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
this
demonstrates
that
these
contracts
satisfy
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
employed
in
its
nadex
order
economic
purpose
event
contracts
on
congressional
control
serve
an
important
role
in
risk
management
specifically
these
contracts
would
allow
individuals
to
be
able
to
reduce
their
risk
exposure
to
changes
in
the
probability
of
different
parties
gaining
control
of
government
many
changes
in
taxes
subsidies
and
program
design
are
favored
by
one
party
or
another
and
are
thus
more
likely
to
become
law
if
one
party
is
in
power
versus
another
a
small
scale
supplier
for
a
semiconducting
foundry
may
expect
to
see
more
orders
under
a
government
that
has
signaled
through
their
campaign
speeches
and
policy
documents
that
they
will
prioritize
building
a
domestic
semi
conducting
supply
chain
an
electric
car
dealer
may
expect
to
see
fewer
orders
under
a
government
who
may
not
re
authorize
subsidies
for
purchase
while
the
specific
policies
that
become
law
can
not
be
known
with
certainty
there
remains
a
change
in
risk
and
a
change
in
risk
is
what
hedging
instruments
are
designed
to
manage
these
contracts
can
help
those
who
face
disproportionate
risk
offload
the
risk
to
those
who
can
hedging
is
not
the
only
economic
value
that
these
contracts
provide
these
contracts
can
also
serve
as
the
foundation
to
price
other
goods
and
services
the
price
of
commodity
futures
is
based
on
market
expectations
of
supply
and
demand
for
related
goods
assets
or
services
in
the
near
future
both
supply
and
demand
can
depend
in
part
on
government
action
farm
bills
energy
bills
appropriating
direct
government
payments
to
individuals
and
many
other
congressional
actions
can
have
clear
effects
on
the
prices
of
commodities
it
not
enough
for
commodity
traders
to
wait
until
a
bill
becomes
law
to
respondthe
most
accurate
pricing
will
reflect
the
probability
of
various
policy
changes
as
well
and
it
is
impossible
to
accurately
forecast
the
probability
of
a
bill
passing
without
knowing
the
probability
of
political
control
of
congress
this
explains
the
considerable
amount
of
academic
articles
news
reports
and
industry
analyses
discussing
the
implications
of
various
elections
or
even
changes
in
election
polling
for
commodity
prices
for
one
representative
example
see
here
but
knowing
the
probability
of
a
given
party
controlling
congress
implicates
more
than
just
the
prices
of
financial
assets
it
also
impacts
the
way
businesses
make
decisions
for
instance
a
firm
may
not
invest
in
creating
a
program
that
relies
on
specific
tax
breaks
if
they
are
uncertain
about
whether
those
subsidies
will
continue
into
the
near
future

book
notes
that
many
contacts
had
held
off
on
making
core
business
decisions
until
after
the
elections
had
occurred
in
order
to
reduce
uncertainty
having
a
market
based
probability
estimate
could
thus
help
them
make
the
best
decision
without
having
to
forgo
months
of
lost
profits
by
waiting
social
purpose
beyond
providing
a
tool
for
risk
management
and
price
discovery
these
contracts
serve
a
valuable
social
purpose
and
promote
the
public
interest
by
providing
a
market
derived
data
point
on
the
outcome
of
the
election
in
recent
years
the
rise
of
asymmetric
non
response
bias
can
result
in
egregious
polling
misses
in
key
states
see
the
2016
and
2020
presidential
and
congressional
elections
as
a
result
media
companies
are
often
left
reporting
inaccurate
polls
to
the
public
leaving
their
viewers
misinformed
prediction
markets
help
improve
this
state
of
affairs
through
two
mechanisms
first
they
introduce
competition
into
the
polling
industry
as
the
media
now
has
an
alternative
if
prediction
markets
consistently
outperform
polls
as
some
historical
evidence
suggests
they
might

and

prediction
markets
vs
an
examination
of
accuracy
for
the
2008
and
2012
us
elections
the
journal
of
prediction
markets

2014
then
the
media
might
opt
to
use
them
instead
as
a
result
the
demand
for
any
given
polling
company
will
decline
and
they
thus
have
an
incentive
to
invest
resources
in
solving
many
of
the
issues
that
had
bedeviled
polling
in
the
past
second
prediction
markets
can
incorporate
information
faster
and
more
comprehensively
than
polls
and
statistical
models
after
a
crucial
event
polling
companies
must
wait
several
days
to
conduct
a
sufficient
sample
size
to
report
their
effects
and
statistical
models
must
wait
until
a
sufficient
number
of
these
post
event
polls
have
been
conducted
in
order
to
update
in
contrast
because
non
hedging
prediction
market
traders
are
highly
incentivized
to
closely
follow
the
news
and
gain
an
edge
over
their
fellow
traders
they
will
react
as
soon
as
the
event
occurs
offering
a
more
real
time
analysis
of
the
state
of
the
race
as
a
result
media
companies
who
wish
to
report
on
the
effect
of
the
event
and
who
are
unlikely
to
wait
the
one
to
three
weeks
for
enough
polls
to
come
in
can
rely
on
a
validated
market
based
approach
instead
of
the
prognostication
of
individual
pundits
who
tend
to
have
a
much
worse
track
record
than
even
a
simple
polling
averages
while
media
companies
may
benefit
from
having
more
accurate
information
the
true
beneficiaries
are
the
broader
public
who
will
be
better
informed
as
a
result
of
the
introduction
of
these
contracts
into
the
marketplace
election
integrity
in
the
last
decade
plus
millions
of
contracts
on
political
contracts
have
traded
and
election
trading
has
picked
up
in
volume
on
overseas
exchanges
especially
those
in
britain
notwithstanding
this
trend
i
am
aware
of
no
data
or
studies
suggesting
it
has
had
an
impact
on
election
integrity
this
should
assuage
commission
concerns
about
impacts
on
elections
themselves
conclusion
in
short
election
markets
are
a
powerful
tool
for
hedging
price
basing
and
promoting
the
public
interest
they
represent
the
kind
of
innovation
that
the
cftc
should
embrace
and
i
would
encourage
them
to
allow
the
proposed
contract
to
proceed
very
truly
