dear

rsbix
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
submit
public
comment
on
proposed
rule
pr
890724
the
proposed
rule
or
the
proposal
which
pertains
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
the
commission
regulations
pursuant
to
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
rsbix
aims
to
be
the
first
cftc
regulated
futures
exchange
that
offers
sports
event
futures
contracts
to
allow
the
sports
and
sports
betting
industries
access
to
financial
instruments
and
hedging
mechanisms
to
better
manage
the
risks
associated
with
their
operations
specifically
rsbix
seeks
to
become
a
regulated
designated
contract
market
dcm
with
contracts
cleared
through
a
cftc
regulated
entity
cftcregulated
dcms
and
clearinghouses
are
widely
recognized
as
the
best
regulated
derivatives
exchanges
in
the
world
cftc
regulation
benefits
hedgers
customers
industry
participants
and
serves
the
broader
economy
by
ensuring
market
integrity
and
financial
stability
many
issues
raised
in
the
proposal
relevant
to
gaming
or
the
sports
betting
industry
are
not
novel
to
our
ongoing
dialogue
with
the
commission
since
december
2018
we
have
engaged
in
thoughtful
discussions
with
the
cftc
and
its
staff
consistently
providing
written
materials
addressing
potential
concerns
on
these
matters
we
have
provided
continuous
feedback
and
plan
to
continue
with
future
dialogue
in
the
hope
that
we
can
find
the
solution
that
serves
both
the
public
interest
and
the
legal
sports
betting
market
industry
interest
we
hope
that
this
comment
letter
furthers
that
purpose
contracts
involving
gaming
are
not
categorically
contrary
to
public
interest
nowhere
in
the
cea
including
in
the
dodd
frank
provisions
relating
to
event
contracts
in
section
is
it
stated
that
contracts
involving
the
enumerated
activities
are
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
statute
does
not
establish
a
blanket
prohibition
on
contracts
involving
gaming
recognizing
that
not
all
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
view
is
supported
by
commissioner
mersinger
dissenting
statement
which
states
the
proposal
would
allow
the
commission
to
make
the
substantive
policy
determination
that
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
regardless
of
their
terms
and
conditions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
consequences
of
such
a
determination
are
severe
a
complete
prohibition
on
exchanges
ability
to
list
event
contracts
and
on
market
participants
ability
to
trade
them
if
congress
had
intended
for
the
commission
to
wield
this
immense
authority
surely
it
would
have
said
so
similarly
we
cite
former
sec
general
counsel
cftc
general
counsel
and
former
cftc
commissioner
dan
berkovitz
statement
related
to
review
of
erisx
certification
of
nfl
futures
contracts
in
which
he
states
the
following
notably
however
the
cea
gaming
provision
does
not
require
the
commission
to
prohibit
contracts
involving
gaming
or
to
prohibit
a
contract
simply
because
it
involves
gaming
it
provides
the
commission
with
the
discretion
to
prohibit
them
in
my
view
the
commission
should
recognize
the
significant
growth
of
sports
betting
as
a
legalized
activity
in
recent
years
with
significant
underlying
commercial
activity
the
commission
should
permit
a
dcm
to
list
contracts
involving
sports
events
where
a
dcm
demonstrates
that
such
contracts
have
an
economic
purpose
and
hedging
utility
related
to
such
commercial
activity
because
in
many
states
sports
betting
is
now
legal
under
both
state
and
federal
law
it
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
the
commission
to
permit
the
listing
of
sports
event
contracts
if
an
exchange
can
demonstrate
that
the
contracts
will
be
used
to
hedge
commercial
risks
arising
from
lawful
commercial
activity
related
to
sports
betting
it
should
be
noted
that
commissioner
berkovitz
comments
were
published
in
april
2021
when
only
25
states
plus
the
district
of
columbia
had
legalized
sports
betting
many
of
which
were
in
only
their
first
or
second
year
of
having
operational
markets
the
industry
has
significantly
matured
in
the
meantime
much
of
which
we
touch
upon
through
this
comment
letter
cea
section
grants
the
commission
discretion
to
prohibit
an
event
contract
from
being
listed
for
trading
on
an
exchange
1
if
the
contract
involves
one
of
five
enumerated
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
or
v
2
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
public
interest
the
same
cea
section
also
provides
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
the
discretion
to
determine
that
an
event
contract
involves
other
similar
activity
to
the
five
enumerated
activities
to
be
contrary
to
public
interest
the
section
was
added
to
the
cea
in
2010
by
the
dodd
frank
act
one
year
after
dodd
frank
enactment
rule
was
adopted
by
the
commission
to
implement
these
provisions
proposed
rule
89
fr
48968
amends
rule
rule
prohibits
the
listing
of
an
agreement
contract
or
transaction
that
involves
relates
to
or
references
the
enumerated
activities
rule
provides
for
a
90
day
review
period
for
any
such
contract
that
the
commission
determines
involves
an
enumerated
activity
referenced
in
the
proposal
among
other
things
folds
the
two
distinct
discretionary
determinations
of
cea
section
into
one
by
the
mere
fact
of
involving
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
such
an
event
contract
is
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
on
its
face
we
take
this
to
mean
that
the
enumerated
activities
themselves
are
in
some
sense
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
interpretation
goes
beyond
the
statutory
text
even
if
the
enumerated
activities
list
demonstrates
congressional
intent
to
empower
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contracts
that
would
effectively
serve
as
a
wagering
vehicle
subject
to
a
commission
determination
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
public
interest
as
the
commission
states
that
does
not
support
a
blanket
prohibition
of
all
contracts
involving
gaming
however
defined
the
statute
itself
recognizes
that
not
all
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
requiring
a
separate
determination
additionally
one
of
these
five
enumerated
activities
is
not
like
the
others
and
the
others
are
all
markedly
like
each
other
among
the
five
enumerated
activities
gaming
is
the
only
activity
that
currently
has
a
widespread
legal
and
regulated
industry
in
many
jurisdictions
whether
on
a
nationwide
or
international
level
and
which
a
enjoys
a
high
degree
of
participation
among
americans
the
other
items
on
the
list
are
either
strictly
illegal
like
assassination
and
terrorism
or
in
the
case
of
war
not
a
commercial
industry
in
the
conventional
sense
of
the
term
all
three
pertain
to
some
form
of
political
violence
which
is
universally
abhorred
additionally
we
consider
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
to
be
a
purposeful
means
of
ensuring
that
the
commission
has
the
discretion
to
prohibit
an
event
contract
involving
activities
either
not
worthy
of
explicit
consideration
by
congress
or
not
within
the
present
or
future
consideration
of
congress
at
the
time
of
writing
the
items
on
this
list
created
in
2010
illustrates
the
congressional
intent
to
ensure
markets
would
not
be
used
to
facilitate
or
promote
illegal
activity
the
inclusion
of
gaming
as
an
enumerated
activity
in
this
list
is
thus
a
relic
of
time
buried
by
legal
developments
in
the
form
of
widespread
legalization
and
regulation
of
gaming
the
commission
interprets
gaming
activity
presence
on
the
enumerated
activities
list
as
congressional
intent
to
empower
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contracts
that
would
effectively
serve
as
a
wagering
vehicle
subject
to
a
commission
determination
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
public
interest
because
gaming
was
identified
as
an
enumerated
activity
separate
and
apart
from
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
footnote
115
of
the
proposal
in
so
doing
the
commission
relies
on
a
2010
colloquy
between
the
late
senator
diane
feinstein
and
senator
blanche
lincoln
regarding
the
proposed
dodd
frank
act
provision
that
ultimately
was
enacted
as
cea
section
commission
needs
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivatives
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
supposed
event
contracts
ibid
with
respect
to
gaming
being
included
separate
and
apart
from
activity
illegal
under
any
federal
or
state
law
we
believe
that
this
distinction
likely
reflects
congress
intent
to
make
its
specific
concerns
explicit
for
instance
terrorism
is
by
definition
illegal
and
so
could
have
just
as
easily
fallen
under
the
umbrella
of
an
activity
illegal
under
federal
or
state
law
nevertheless
congress
included
it
as
an
enumerated
activity
in
order
to
necessitate
that
the
commission
evaluates
any
contract
involving
terrorism
according
to
the
public
interest
standard
and
to
make
its
specific
concern
with
respect
to
terrorism
evident
we
concur
with
commissioner
mersinger
sentiment
expressed
in
her
dissenting
statement
on
the
proposal
i
admit
that
i
am
not
going
to
lose
sleep
over
a
determination
that
all
event
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination
and
war
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
similar
analysis
can
be
extended
to
assassination
and
war
as
well
by
including
gaming
as
an
enumerated
activity
congress
intended
to
make
its
concerns
clear
regarding
gaming
involved
contracts
qua
a
broadly
illegal
and
federally
banned
activity
at
the
time
dodd
frank
act
was
passed
the
colloquy
provides
evidence
of
this
both
in
form
and
substance
as
a
matter
of
substance
congress
mandated
the
commission
exercise
discretion
to
evaluate
gaming
related
contracts
according
to
the
public
interest
standard
rather
than
mandating
blanket
prohibition
precisely
because
such
contracts
could
predominantly
function
to
inappropriately
enable
gaming
at
the
time
when
gaming
was
broadly
illegal
and
sports
betting
was
banned
from
being
legalized
in
any
state
where
it
was
not
already
legal
in
46
out
of
50
states
delaware
nevada
oregon
and
montana
were
exempt
from
parts
of
paspa
delaware
oregon
and
montana
hosted
sports
lotteries
permitted
sports
pools
rather
than
sports
betting
in
the
typical
sense
of
the
term
but
that
function
is
longer
the
potentially
predominant
one
we
agree
with
the
commission
that
the
cited
colloquy
sentence
is
particularly
instructive
as
a
matter
of
determining
intent
but
we
respectfully
believe
that
deeper
analysis
leads
to
a
different
implication
than
the
commission
own
the
2010
colloquy
occurred
in
a
vastly
different
legal
landscape
with
respect
to
gaming
and
sports
betting
when
the
professional
and
amateur
sports
protection
act
paspa
banned
states
from
legalizing
sports
betting
with
nevada
being
the
primary
exception
we
respectfully
correct
the
commission
statement
that
there
were
casino
sportsbooks
in
new
jersey
when
cea
section
was
enacted
paspa
was
at
issue
before
the
supreme
court
in
murphy
national
collegiate
athletic
association
2018
because
new
jersey
attempted
to
legalize
sports
betting
have
legalized
sportsbooks
casinos
included
in
this
context
the
capacity
for
derivatives
contracts
to
predominantly
function
as
a
means
to
enable
gaming
rather
than
as
legitimate
hedging
tools
was
significantly
heightened
due
to
the
extremely
limited
legal
sports
betting
industry
this
was
so
in
two
immediate
respects
first
the
want
of
a
legal
hedging
mechanism
for
the
sports
betting
industry
was
minor
relative
to
today
precisely
because
of
the
limited
nature
of
sportsbook
operations
which
were
confined
to
nevada
as
a
result
sportsbook
operators
which
themselves
were
casinos
faced
less
absolute
exposure
and
risk
from
the
outcomes
of
sporting
events
second
that
only
nevada
held
legal
sports
betting
markets
meant
that
most
prospective
bettors
were
unable
to
place
legal
bets
in
their
resident
states
leaving
them
wanting
for
some
legal
means
to
do
so
like
a
derivatives
market
existent
only
predominantly
to
enable
gaming
the
use
of
the
phrase
predominantly
to
enable
gaming
is
especially
noteworthy
in
the
colloquy
it
implies
facilitating
an
activity
that
faces
substantial
barriers
or
impediments
in
this
case
the
near
universal
prohibition
of
sports
betting
under
paspa
now
the
premise
underlying
the
2010
statement
has
been
fundamentally
altered
such
impediments
are
no
longer
the
sports
betting
industry
now
in
its
sixth
year
of
legal
existence
has
evolved
into
a
robust
economic
sector
with
legitimate
risk
management
needs
and
a
wealth
of
consumers
across
nearly
40
states
on
this
latter
point
we
cite
an
illustrative
example
by
the
american
gaming
association
aga
who
reported
that
a
record
million
american
adults
26
were
expected
to
bet
on
super
bowl
lviii
a
35
percent
increase
from
2023
further
statistics
show
that
million
american
adults
plan
to
place
a
traditional
sports
wager
online
at
a
retail
sportsbook
or
with
a
bookie
up
41
percent
from
2023
and
that
million
adults
or
11
percent
intend
to
place
online
wagers
using
a
legal
sportsbook
ibid
in
this
new
context
there
is
scant
functional
need
for
derivatives
markets
that
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gaming
because
gaming
or
sports
betting
is
now
widespread
and
legally
accessible
in
most
states
even
still
those
who
do
not
have
access
to
legal
markets
in
their
resident
state
readily
find
illegal
offshore
online
platforms
through
which
they
can
wager
on
sports
but
which
do
not
offer
them
or
their
state
any
of
the
protections
or
benefits
of
a
regulated
platform
advertisements
for
offshore
online
bookies
abound
on
the
internet
and
are
often
interspersed
among
advertisements
for
legal
and
regulated
sportsbooks
with
no
evident
distinction
between
the
legal
status
of
the
two
platforms
this
is
an
issue
that
the
legal
sports
betting
industry
has
been
combatting
crucially
the
causal
relationship
expressed
in
the
statement
that
potential
contracts
may
exist
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
warrants
careful
examination
the
function
of
predominantly
enabling
gaming
was
the
very
reason
these
contracts
were
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
however
today
this
potential
function
is
completely
vestigial
if
the
primary
reason
for
these
contracts
being
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
no
longer
relevant
with
broad
legalization
and
regulation
of
sports
betting
in
most
states
and
illegal
offshore
online
platforms
illicitly
enabling
gaming
in
the
others
to
the
detriments
of
those
states
and
their
residents
it
follows
that
the
event
contracts
are
no
longer
contrary
to
the
public
interest
on
these
grounds
the
entire
gaming
landscape
has
changed
there
is
no
need
for
event
contracts
to
exist
to
predominantly
enable
gaming
because
gaming
is
already
broadly
accessible
now
the
predominant
function
of
such
event
contracts
would
be
to
serve
legitimate
hedging
purposes
for
the
sports
betting
industry
such
that
they
can
better
manage
their
financial
risks
and
stay
competitive
with
the
illegal
offshore
bookmakers
who
predate
on
american
citizens
both
purposes
protect
the
interests
of
american
citizens
and
the
states
in
which
they
live
and
therefore
the
public
interest
we
respectfully
urge
the
commission
to
consider
the
current
economic
and
legal
reality
of
the
gaming
industry
rather
than
the
sentiments
of
a
restrictive
legal
landscape
that
more
than
a
supermajority
of
states
have
displaced
while
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
prohibit
certain
gaming
related
contracts
that
it
determines
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
authority
does
not
extend
to
a
blanket
prohibition
the
text
of
the
statute
the
statements
of
current
and
former
commissioners
the
changed
legal
landscape
and
the
legitimate
economic
purposes
of
such
contracts
all
support
a
more
nuanced
approach
that
considers
each
contract
on
its
merits
ii
the
sports
betting
industry
needs
hedging
tools
the
commission
offers
in
its
proposal
two
statements
addressing
the
potential
for
event
contracts
involving
gaming
to
be
used
as
legitimate
hedging
tools
both
with
which
we
contend
below
1
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
others
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
including
the
outcome
of
such
a
contest
or
game
generally
is
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
price
of
commodities
or
other
financial
assets
or
instruments
limiting
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
an
event
contract
involving
such
an
occurrence
2
that
the
commission
believes
that
contracts
involving
such
occurrences
are
likely
to
be
traded
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
and
can
not
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
commission
both
evidence
and
industry
members
have
contradicted
such
notions
the
need
for
a
legitimate
hedging
tool
is
inherent
to
how
sportsbook
conduct
operations
and
is
quantifiably
foreseen
for
each
event
sportsbooks
do
not
themselves
engage
in
wagers
or
bets
on
the
outcome
of
sporting
events
operators
instead
aim
to
create
a
balanced
book
where
the
money
wagered
on
both
sides
of
a
sporting
event
outcome
are
equal
usually
by
incentivizing
or
disincentivizing
prospective
bettors
one
way
or
the
other
through
more
attractive
or
less
favorable
odds
respectively
this
means
that
on
an
event
where
the
money
on
each
side
is
equal
the
money
from
the
loser
goes
toward
paying
the
winner
no
matter
which
group
is
which
in
this
ideal
scenario
the
sportsbook
revenue
is
captured
in
minor
odds
disparities
this
revenue
known
in
the
industry
as
the
vigorish
or
vig
is
essentially
the
sportsbook
commission
for
facilitating
the
wager
for
example
in
a
typical
point
spread
bet
with
odds
on
both
sides
a
bettor
must
wager
110
to
win
100
if
the
book
is
perfectly
balanced
and
is
bet
on
each
side
the
sportsbook
collects
total
when
paying
out
to
the
winning
side
the
sportsbook
retains
100
as
its
vig
or
commission
representing
a
theoretical
hold
of
about
of
the
total
amount
wagered
this
commission
structure
allows
sportsbooks
to
generate
revenue
regardless
of
the
event
outcome
provided
they
maintain
a
balanced
book
but
there
is
a
reason
this
situation
is
only
an
ideal
one
sportsbooks
frequently
encounter
situations
where
there
a
disproportionate
amount
of
money
wagered
on
one
side
of
an
event
when
such
an
imbalance
occurs
the
sportsbook
adjusts
its
odds
they
typically
respond
by
making
odds
more
attractive
for
the
less
popular
side
and
less
favorable
for
the
heavily
backed
side
to
encourage
a
more
balanced
distribution
of
wagers
this
may
mean
losing
bettors
to
other
sportsbooks
or
offshore
operators
as
a
result
the
state
by
state
regulatory
scheme
of
the
sports
betting
industry
amplifies
this
issue
consider
the
following
example
new
york
licensed
sportsbooks
are
prohibited
from
accepting
out
of
state
wagers
creating
a
natural
imbalance
in
the
book
on
any
given
game
involving
a
home
team
bills
fans
the
majority
of
whom
are
presumably
in
new
york
would
rarely
consider
betting
against
their
team
especially
on
a
home
game
and
the
same
could
be
said
for
fans
of
the
giants
or
jets
for
these
games
the
sportsbook
must
either
operate
with
an
imbalanced
book
or
offer
unattractive
odds
in
an
attempt
to
artificially
balance
it
attempts
which
are
rarely
successful
as
fans
are
more
likely
to
turn
to
another
platform
or
forego
the
bet
altogether
this
imbalance
is
readily
perceptible
and
easily
identified
as
exposure
to
the
outcome
of
the
sporting
event
because
if
the
bills
win
the
sportsbook
may
not
have
enough
money
on
the
other
side
to
cover
the
winnings
more
attractive
odds
are
generally
insufficient
to
induce
fans
to
overcome
hometown
sentiments
this
scenario
demonstrates
why
sportsbooks
need
effective
risk
management
tools
the
exposure
is
quantifiable
foreseeable
and
directly
linked
to
specific
sporting
event
outcomes
sportsbook
operations
strive
to
be
outcome
indifferent
by
design
but
aspects
of
the
current
regulatory
landscape
and
consumer
tendencies
often
prevents
them
from
achieving
this
goal
in
contrast
other
entities
in
the
sports
industry
such
as
stadium
owners
and
other
vendors
necessarily
have
a
vested
interest
in
their
home
team
performance
and
which
they
have
no
means
to
attempt
to
mitigate
or
offset
like
sportsbooks
their
economic
success
is
inherently
tied
to
how
well
a
team
does
creating
a
different
kind
of
exposure
that
could
also
benefit
from
risk
management
tools
for
instance
potential
playoff
prospects
especially
deep
ones
energize
a
fanbase
into
higher
attendance
ticket
prices
and
merchandise
sales
among
other
things
for
regular
season
games
home
playoff
games
are
themselves
boons
to
revenue
in
like
manner
these
effects
are
also
present
downstream
for
businesses
like
hotels
and
restaurants
within
radius
of
the
stadium
and
the
home
team
city
as
individuals
from
within
the
state
or
fans
from
out
of

to
watch
games

put
so
appropriately
in
his
comments
concerning

in
this

these

the
like
in
order
to
secure
a
future
profit
that
is
uncertain
and
the
success
of
which
depends
on
factors
beyond
their
control
their
team
collapse
is
the
sporting
equivalent
of
a
drought
induced
crop
failure
an
event
that
may
undo
even
the
most
diligently
executed
business
plan
the
contracts
are
a
mechanism
for
the
venue
owners
and
vendors
to
hedge
their
risk
exposure
in
the
same
way
that
farmers
use
the

to
protect

commissioner

herself
has
also
substantiated
this
notion
with
respect
to

securing

to

in
her
dissenting
statement
on

combats

that

and
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
or

interest
therein
commissioner
mersinger
states
the
following
these
assertions
are
entirely
conjectural
as
the
proposal
does
not
cite
any
support
for
these
statements
one
can
readily
envision
an
event
contract
involving
whether
a
particular
us
city
will
be
awarded
the
summer
or
winter
olympic
games
in
a
given
year
which
would
be
used
by
hotel
and
restaurant
owners
as
well
as
other
businesses
that
would
make
money
if
their
city
gets
the
olympics
but
not
if
the
olympics
are
awarded
elsewhere
such
an
event
contract
would
not
necessarily
be
used
predominantly
for
entertainment
or
speculative
purposes
exposure
to
the
outcome
of
sporting
events
is
not
isolated
to
the
quality
of
performance
of
a
relevant
home
team
however
there
is
also
a
general
tendency
for
an
imbalance
to
exist
on
the
basis
of
which
team
is
favorited
to
win
no
matter
the
states
or
sportsbooks
in

aggregated

shows
that
these

this

jason

is
a
direct
response
to
the
growing
challenge
of

taxes

the

legitimate

they
not

bolster

by
allowing

to

also
benefit

both
of

we
believe

is
quantifiable
predictable
and
directly
correlated

furthermore
we
contend
that

none
the
well
known
scandal
involving
dodgers
superstar
shohei
ohtani
and
his
former
translator
ippei
mizuhara
is
a
perfect
example
of
everything
wrong
with
offshore
industry
and
everything
right
with
the
regulated
industry
mizuhara
was
the
well
known
interpreter
and
best
friend
of
the
world
biggest
baseball
star
whom
everyone
in
the
sports
world
anticipated
to
be
receiving
the
largest
sports
contract
in
history
mizuhara
offshore
bookmaker
certainly
exploited
these
facts
in
choosing
to
allow
mizuhara
to
steep
himself
deeper
and
deeper
in
debt
despite
clear
signs
of
gambling
addiction
ohtani
likely
would
have
never
been
roped
in
at
least
not
more
than
by
association
by
the
very
nature
of
operating
illegally
the
bookmaker
evades
the
very
consumer
protections
and
regulatory
accountability
inherent
in
heavily
regulated
industries
like
sports
betting
legalized
sportsbooks
do
offer
credit
so
mizuhara
would
have
never
been
able
to
accumulate
such
mountainous
debt
if
he
could
and
would
have
used
one
and
further
responsible
gaming
regulations
and
protections
would
have
long
prevented
such
monumental
losses
and
chasing
behavior
since
legalized
sportsbooks
are
obligated
by
law
to
actively
identify
potential
problem
gamblers
and
prevent
them
from
betting
in
a
hypothetical
and
hopefully
future
world
where
illegal
off

bookmakers
do
operate
in
the
mizuhara
issues
would
have
never
reached
scandalous
heights
put
this
way
mizuhara
himself

without

by

the
operational

and
allowing

sportsbooks
to
offset
their
risk
we
combat
the
offshore
industry
and
protect
the
public
interest
offshore
sportsbooks
may
offer
more
attractive
odds
than
their
regulated
us
counterparts
due
to
the
offshore
industry
ability
to
operate
with
fewer
restrictions
and
access
to
foreign
exchanges
whereby
they
can
hedge
risks
caused
by
imbalanced
wagers
they
also
benefit
from
a
single
global
pool
of
bettors
unencumbered
by
state
by
state
regulations
and
divisions
by
sidestepping
regulatory
compliance
taxes
and
consumer
protection
measures
these
offshore
operators
may
seem
to
provide
better
odds
to
bettors
but
in
reality
they
pose
significant
risks
to
the
public
interest
they
operate
without
accountability
leaving
bettors
vulnerable
to
potential
fraud
or
non
payment
of
winnings
moreover
they
contribute
nothing
to
state
economies
depriving
communities
of
tax
revenue
that
could
fund
essential
public
services
their
lack
of
responsible
gaming
measures
also
puts
vulnerable
individuals
at
greater
risk
of
developing
gambling
problems
in
essence
while
offshore
books
might
occasionally
offer
superficially
attractive
odds
they
do
so
at
the
cost
of
public
safety
economic
contribution
and
social
responsibility
that
regulated
sportsbooks
are
required
to
uphold
enabling
regulated
sportsbooks
to
hedge
risks
associated
with
the
outcomes
of
sporting
events
means
that
they
can
offer
more
competitive
odds
and
products
enhancing
their
ability
to
compete
with
offshore
operators
this
in
turn
would
help
protect
consumers
ensure
responsible
gaming
practices
contribute
to
state
economies
through
tax
revenue
and
maintain
the
integrity
of
sports
betting
all
while
operating
within
a
regulated
framework
that
prioritizes
public
interest
and
safety
without
such
a
mechanism
the
offshore
industry
has
a
head
start
such
contracts
serve
the
public
interest
directly
because
the
regulated
industry
protects
the
public
interest
directly
the
regulated
sports
betting
industry
also
prevents
violations
of
sports
integrity
and
therefore
market
manipulation
as
the
contended
in
the
proposed
rule
in
the
case
that
event
contracts
involving
outcomes
on
sporting
events
were
approved
by
the
commission
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
cftc
to
oversee
or
regulate
sporting
events
doing
so
would
be
entirely
superfluous
because
there
are
already
state
gaming
regulators
who
ensure
the
integrity
of
sports
betting
markets
and
their
relations
to
each
other
sports
integrity
and
sports
betting
markets
are
each
heavily
policed
and
monitored
and
entire
companies
exist
within
the
industry
to
support
regulators
and
sportsbooks
in
their
efforts
to
maintain
integrity
we
echo
the
sentiments
of
commissioner
mersinger
in
this
regard
after
all
the
cftc
has
anti
fraud
and
anti
manipulation
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
futures
contracts
on
broad
based
security
indices
but
that
does
not
mean
the
cftc
regulates
the
securities
markets
or
that
it
is
tasked
with
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
securities
markets
or
enforcement
of
securities
laws
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sec
does
all
that
the
cftc
similarly
has
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
natural
gas
and
electricity
since
there
are
futures
contracts
on
those
commodities
but
that
does
not
mean
the
cftc
regulates
the
transmission
of
natural
gas
or
electricity
or
that
it
is
tasked
with
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
physical
natural
gas
or
power
markets
or
enforcement
of
the
natural
gas
act
or
the
federal
power
act
the
federal
energy
regulatory

ferc
does
all
that
integrity
a
technology
driven

that
provides

and
the
trusted
partner
to
over
95
operators
150
colleges
and
universities
50
gaming
suppliers
and
25
professional
sports
leagues
provides
evidence
that
the
concerns
broached
by
the
proposal
are
misplaced
in
his
comment
letter
regarding
the
review
of
proposed
rsbix
nfl
futures
contracts
matthew
holt
president
of
integrity
stated
that
the
company
does
not
believe
that
the
trading
of
these
contracts
will
create
incentives
for
the
manipulation
of
sporting
event
outcomes
there
is
already
in
place
a
robust
set
of
mechanisms
to
prevent
such
manipulation
the
advent
of
lawful
licensed
sports
betting
throughout
much
of
the
country
has
lead
to
an
increase
in
resources
and
attention
devoted
to
these
efforts
a
national
futures
market
of
the
sort
contemplated
here
will
neither
add
to
the
incentive
for
unlawful
activity
nor
make
it
more

contrary
to
common
misconceptions
regulated
sportsbooks
play
a
vital
role
in
maintaining
sports
integrity
their
comprehensive
data
collection
and
betting
market
monitoring
practices
serve
not
only
their
commercial
interests
but
also
act
as
a
safeguard
against
potential
manipulation
of
sporting
events
these
sportsbooks
effectively
function
as
integrity
watchdogs
often
working
in
tandem
with
companies
like
integrity
and
professional
sports
leagues
this
collaboration
stems
from
a
shared
vested
interest
both
entities
depend
on
fair
and
unpredictable
sporting
outcomes
to
maintain
the
integrity
and
profitability
of
their
respective
products
as
such
regulated
sportsbooks
contribute
significantly
to
the
detection
and
prevention
of
suspicious
betting
patterns
or
potential
match
fixing
attempts
thereby
bolstering
rather
than
undermining
sports
integrity
efforts
the
legalization
of
sports
betting
has
been
a
boon
to
the
data
visibility
and
analytics
used
to
sniff
out

over

to
flag
the

even
after
the

less
favorable

such
as
for

moreover
us
integrity
analysis
revealed
a
disproportionate
volume
of
bets
specifically
on
nuerdanbieke
to
secure
victory
in
the
first
round
an
outcome
that
ultimately
materialized
this
betting
pattern
particularly
the
continued
influx
of
wagers
despite
worsening
odds
and
the
specific
focus
on
a
first
round
win
raised
significant
suspicions
about
the
integrity
of
the
event
nuerdanbieke
won
by
technical
knockout
67
seconds
into

minner
threw
a

kick
then
visibly
winced
and
grabbed
his

surprisingly
he
immediately
kicked
with
the

leg
again
nuerdanbieke
quickly
capitalized
on
minner
apparent
injury
leading
the
referee
to
stop
the
fight
reports
stated
that
rumors
circulated
before
the
fight
that
minner
injured
his
left
leg
and
betting
insiders
attempted
to
seize
the
opportunity
following
these
suspicious
betting
patterns
regulatory

took
swift
action
on
november

the
nevada
state
athletic

nsac
suspended
the
corner
license
of
james

and
remains
suspended
to
this

known
for

through

new

division

njdge
prohibited
its

in

the

took
decisive
action
they
released

from

banned
krause
from
attending
or
cornering

furthermore
they
prohibited
any
of
krause
trainees
from
participating
in

while
under
his
guidance
taking
away
the
need
for
regulatory
action
similar
to
that
of
njdge
statistics
also
do
away
with
concerns
over
sports
integrity
in

sportradar
integrity
services
division
released
its

corruption
and

report
analyzing
approximately
sporting
events
across
70
sports
the
findings
revealed
suspicious
matches
in
2023
spanning
11
sports
in
105
countries
a
slight
increase
from
the
suspicious

detected
in
2022
notably
of
sporting

showed
no
suspicious

activity
and
no

ratio
exceeding
1
importantly
only
35
of
the
matches
exhibiting
suspicious

activity
in
2023
occurred
in

these
statistics
underscore
both
the
effectiveness
of
existing
monitoring
systems
and
the
relatively
low
incidence
of
suspicious
activity
in
the
vast
majority
of
sporting

importantly
these
incidents
are
only
of
suspicious
activity
rather
than
confirmed
cases
of
match

or

this
distinction
is
crucial
as
it
highlights
the
proactive
nature
of
integrity
monitoring
systems
in
flagging
potential
issues
for
further
investigation
rather
than
definitive
proof
of
wrongdoing
commissioner
mersinger
discussion
within
her
dissenting
statement
on
the
same
point
highlights
the
inconsistency
in
the
commission
approach
to
event
contracts
on
sporting
events
versus
traditional
futures
contracts
she
notes
that
the
proposal
rationale
for
deeming
these
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
potential
for
athletes
or
coaches
to
spread
misinformation
could
equally
apply
to
many
traditional
exchange
traded
futures
contracts
for
example
she
cites
that
oil
companies
or
agricultural
firms
also
have
access
to
media
combined
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regarding
the
oil
or
other
industry
that
could
be
used
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
and
yet
futures
contracts
in
these
sectors
are
permitted
and
widely
traded
the
commissioner
rightly
questions
this
inconsistency
pointing
out
that
while
an
event
contract
allowing
players
or
coaches
to
trade
would
indeed
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
proposal
overreaches
by
concluding
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
even
when
their
terms
and
conditions
explicitly
prohibit
these
individuals
from
trading
it
is
already
standard
practice
in
the
sports
betting
industry
to
prohibit
players
coaches
and
other
potential
insiders
from
wagering
on
their
own
sport
this
prohibition
is
typically
enforced
through
league
policies
state
regulations
and
sportsbooks
own
terms
of
service
demonstrating
that
such
restrictions
are
both
feasible
and
effective
in
maintaining
market
integrity
companies
such
as
us
integrity
play
an
integral
role
in
enforcing
this
practice
this
stance
seems
to
disregard
the
effectiveness
of
contractual
prohibitions
and
regulatory
oversight
that
are
common
practice
in
other
futures
markets
and
applies
a
different
standard
to
sports
event
contracts
without
clear
justification
this
comparison
underscores
a
critical
flaw
in
the
proposal
reasoning
it
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
regulated
sports
betting
industry
like
traditional
futures
markets
has
developed
robust
mechanisms
to
detect
and
prevent
market
manipulation
as
we
shown
the
collaboration
between
sportsbooks
integrity
monitoring
services
and
regulatory
bodies
has
created
a
vigilant
ecosystem
capable
of
quickly
identifying
investigating
and
addressing
suspicious
activities
given
the
statistical
evidence
we
presented
on
the
low
incidence
of
suspicious
activity
in
sports
betting
and
the
industry
demonstrated
ability
to
self
regulate
effectively
we
contend
that
sports
event
contracts
should
be
evaluated
using
the
same
nuanced
approach
as
other
futures
contracts
the
regulated
sports
betting
industry
ability
to
effectively
monitor
and
address
integrity
concerns
coupled
with
the
statistical
evidence
of
low
incidence
of
suspicious
activity
demonstrates
that
event
contracts
on
sporting
events
do
not
pose
a
unique
or
outsized
risk
to
market
integrity
moreover
these
contracts
serve
the
public
interest
by
enhancing
the
competitiveness
and
risk
management
capabilities
of
regulated
operators
especially
in
their
fight
against
the
offshore
industry
all
of
which
in
turn
strengthens
consumer
protections
and
contributes
to
state
economies
we
respectfully
urge
the
commission
to
consider
the
robust
safeguards
already
in
place
within
the
sports
betting
ecosystem
the
public
interest
benefits
of
a
well
regulated
industry
and
to
approach
the
evaluation
of
sports
event
contracts
with
the
same
nuanced
perspective
applied
to
other
futures
markets
iv
conclusion
the
sports
betting
landscape
in
the
united
states
has
undergone
a
seismic
shift
since
the
enactment
of
cea
section
in
2010
what
was
once
a
predominantly
illegal
activity
is
now
a
legal
thriving
regulated
100
billion
plus
industry
that
serves
the
public
interest
through
consumer
protections
economic
contributions
and
integrity
safeguards
the
commission
proposal
to
categorically
prohibit
event
contracts
involving
gaming
however
defined
fails
to
account
for
these
fundamental
changes
and
overlooks
the
legitimate
hedging
needs
of
industry
participants
we
respectfully
urge
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
approach
to
event
contracts
involving
sporting
event
outcomes
and
gaming
more
broadly
the
text
of
the
cea
does
not
mandate
a
blanket
prohibition
and
such
a
sweeping
measure
would
be
contrary

in
the
context
we
discussed
throughout
this
letter
instead
we
advocate
for
a
nuanced
evaluation
of
each
contract
on
its
merits
taking
into
account
the
changed
legal
landscape
the
demonstrated
and
declared
hedging
utility
for
industry
participants
and
the
robust
integrity
monitoring
systems
already
in
place
by
allowing
cftc
regulated

the
commission
would
empower
the
legal
sports
betting
industry
to
better
manage
risks
compete
more
effectively
with
illegal
and
unregulated
offshore
operators
and
ultimately
better
serve
and
protect
american
