event

pose
difficult
issues
as
the
cftc
contends
with
limited
resources
an
epic
expansion
of
its
regulatory
authority
under
the
dodd
frank
act
and
the
evolution
of
financial
markets
the
utility
risks
and
legal
status
of
event

all
pose
complex
questions
that
have
to
be
addressed
in
a
context
of
inadequate
legislative
guidance
and
consideration
posing
additional
challenges
for
the
cftc
in
this

i
address
some

all
of

clarifying
and
correcting
drafting
in
cea
section
and
the
definition
of
excluded
commodity
any
rulemaking
implementing
section
must
first
construe
that
subsection
intent
this
exercise
is
difficult
because
the
legislature
was
not
thoughtful
or
careful
when
drafting
this
and
other
language
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
simply
put
the
lawyerly
ambition
of
eliciting
congressional
intent
from
the
language
of
the
statute
is
too
optimistic
regarding
the
legislative
process
notwithstanding
that
congress
wields
tremendous
power
over
the
economy
and
the
livelihoods
that
depend
on
it
repeated
experience
with
drafting
shows
that
this
power
is
sometimes
used
in
a
neglectful
manner
with
little
thought
or
care
expert
agencies
such
as
the
cftc
are
left
with
the
task
of
asserting
congressional
intent
and
then
dressing
up
chaotic
realities
in
the
garb
of
legislative
intent
through
reasoning
or
rhetoric
it
is
for
you
and
your
colleagues
to
engage
in
the
linguistic
and
hopefully
somewhat
logical
task
through
which
principle
and
reality
somewhat
cohere
of
course
that
coherence
is
strained
when
the
agency
is
mired
in
political
disagreement
the
mix
of
debate
and
agitation
expose
the
weaknesses
and
artifice
in
agency
efforts
to
achieve
sensible
regulatory
aims
that
congress
fails
to
specify
enable
further
eroding
legitimacy
in
this
regard
i
recall
the
statement
then
commissioner
quintenz
issued
when
erisx
withdrew
its
three
proposed
contracts
that
would
settle
on
nfl
games
a
substantial
thrust
to
his
critical
observations
was
that
the
cftc
was
playing
too
great
a
role
in
defining
public
interest
as
a
matter
of
theory
that
is
supposed
to
be
embodied
in
our
representative
democracy
there
is
substantial
merit
to
the
arguments
quintenz
then
made
but
as
a
pragmatic
matter
his
vision
and
the
vision
of
inexperienced
conservative
judges
he
cites
is
unachievable
and
corrosive
it
is
for
the
cftc
to
do
the
hard
non
democratic
work
of
defining
public
interest
and
otherwise
making
law
because
if
the
cftc
does
do
this
work
no
one
with
any
competence
will
many
decades
of
poor
draftsmanship
in
the
cea
confirm
this
with
that
background
there
are
basic
textual
issues
that
should
be
resolved
in
addressing
restrictions
on
event
contracts
first
there
is
the
interpretation
of
the
reference
to
section
in
the
following
language
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
price
rate
value
or
levels
of
a
commodity
described
in
section
by
a
designated
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
certain
matters
prior
cftc
releases
such
as
the
initial
rulemaking
have
assumed
or
argued
that
the
reference
to
section
is
a
reference
to
the
first
part
of
the
excluded
commodity
definition
in
section
this
is
reflected
in
public
commentary
on
this
question
as
well
such
as
the
article

the
reference
to
is
nonsensical
the
authors
believe
that
congress
instead
meant
to
refer
to
cea
a
reading
consistent
with
cea
focus
on
excluded
commodities
i
share
the
general
impression
that
here
congress
made
a
typo
particularly
due
to
the
large
but
incomplete
overlap
between
the
language
used
in
section
and
the
language
in
as
a
reminder
the
latter
subsection
includes
a
reference
to
section
where
the
inexplicable
reference
to
section
occurs
likely
some
congressional
staffer
hit
a
few
wrong
keys
and
although
dozens
of
reviewers
were
supposed
to
catch
this
mistake
none
bothered
enough
to
do
the
job
they
are
supposed
to
do
there
is
a
second
interpretive
challenge
however
here
that
does
get
as
much
attention
there
is
likely
an
error
in
the
definition
of
excluded
commodity
in
section
specifically
there
is
an
extra
negation
in
clause
section
reads
as
follows
with

in
my
view
that

intends
to
cover
products
that
are
not
based
on
an
interest
rate
exchange
rate
currency
security
macroeconomic
variables
and
other
items
referenced
in
section
otherwise
section
would
cover
only
contracts
based
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
occurrence
of
contingency
related
to
a
variable
listed
in
section
this
result
would
make
section
largely
redundant
to
and
would
make
a
reference
to
it
in
the
context
of
section
make
little
sense
without
this
correction
to
which
would
strip
out
an
extra
not
contracts
on
various
contests
elections
nfl
games
emmys
would
not
fall
under
section
and
thus
be
treated
as
exempt
commodities
this
result
would
treat
these
event
contracts
like
contracts
on
energy
products
and
metals
this
result
would
also
put
them
outside
of
the
ambit
of
section
which
is
inconsistent
with
any
congressional
purpose
of
having
the
cftc
pay
extra
attention
to
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
etc
as
part
of
this
rulemaking
the
cftc
should
clarify
the
definition
of
excluded
commodities
in
section
it
appears
that
the
cftc
has
implicitly
accepted
that
section
includes
an
extra

omitting

in
the

excerpt
the
cftc
is
proposing
to
amend
and
to
refer
to
agreements
contracts

or

in
excluded

based
on
the

other
than

of

described
in

of
the
act
notably
the
same
confusing
and
likely
erroneous
drafting
occurs
in
section
and
should
also
be
clarified
as
part
of
this
rulemaking
due
to
the
centrality
of
the
excluded
commodity
definition
to
section
for
the
same
reason
and
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
applying
reasonable
corrective
revisions
to
the
cea
i
read
the
scope
of
potential
section
prohibitions
as
excluding
products
covered
under
section
such
as
those
based
on
a
economic
indicators
including
the
cpi
and
other
price
indices
the

with
another

i
do
not
view
numerical
values
produced
through
the
lawmaking
effort
as
opposed
to
decentralized
economic
activity
as
falling
within
the
scope
of
section
for
example
corporate
tax
rates
tariff
levels
allocations
for
industrial
subsidies
and
similar
variables
are
produced
through
centralized
decision
making
and
may
be
within
the
scope
of
section
there
is
ample
scholarship
demonstrating
the
weakness
of
markets
in
producing
accurate
pricing
with
respect
to
political
decisions
as
discussed
below
contracts
settling
on
the
basis
of

decisions
typically
exhibit
highly
noisy
pricing
and
do
not

may
quite
rationally
choose
not
to
trade
in

where
there
is
a
high
degree
of
insider
information
for
example
despite
the
high
intrinsic
interest
in
who
a
supreme
court
nominee
will
be
markets
on
this
topic
have
routinely
failed
and
there
are
common
sense
concerns
with
corruption
manipulation
and
the
appearance
thereof
when
contracts
settle
on
the
basis
of
decisions
by
small
groups
of
elected
individuals
and
their
representatives
a
better
candidate
for
a
derivative
contracts
falling
under
cea
section
would
be
one
that
settled
on
the
basis
of
observed
effective
tax
rates
among
companies
this
metric
unlike
the
de
jure
corporate
tax
rates
would
be
substantially
the
product
of
economic
activity
as
opposed
to
governmental
policymaking
more
generally
and
as
discussed
below
i
urge
the
cftc
to
ban
trading
of
products
based
on
outcomes
attributable
to
the
deliberate
decisions
of
identifiable
individuals
or
organizations
subject
to
a
limitation
where
the
group
becomes
sufficiently
large
an
industry
or
a
set
of
firms
composing
a
broad
index
of
securities
naturally
questions
will
be
raised
as
to
where
individual
decisionmaking
aggregates
to
macro
relevance
but
the
cftc
together
with
the
sec
has
ample
experience
with
this
question
in
the
context
of
security
indices
an
arbitrary
line
will
have
to
be
drawn
but
in
the
core
examples
of
organizational
decisionmaking
the
risk
that
market
positions
influence
insiders
decisions
is
both
too
high
and
too
unlike
the
nature
of
risks
the
cftc
has
experience
and
expertise
policing
moreover
in
these
contexts
markets
are
weak
price
aggregators

defining
as
a
policy
matter
which
categories
of
products
will
be
prohibited
under

the
proposing

requests
comments
on
what
products
should
be
treated
as
those
involving

that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
admittedly
this
requires
the
cftc
to
engage
in
considerations
beyond
its
typical
remit
of
caring
for
the
health
of
derivatives
markets
and
related
cash
markets
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
a
broad
reading
of
the
prohibition
would
be
appropriate
because
enabling
the
listing
of
socially
controversial
products
suspends
the
application
of
state
law
through
preemption
and
puts
pressure
on
cftc
resources
as
primary
watchdog
for
the
products
while
the
cftc
is
ill
equipped
to
make
these
public
interest
determinations
it
is
even
less
well
equipped
to
supervise
trading
where
it
has
implications
for
mental
health
gambling
addiction
foreign
policy
elections
war
assassination
and
terrorism
government
integrity

war
assassination
terrorism
and
other
matters
whose
social
relevance
is
to
a
great
extent
beyond
the
boundaries
of
commerce
and
finance
furthermore
lack
of
clarity
provides
a
disservice
to
the
platforms
interested
in
listing
the
contracts
for
the
benefit
of
their
outside
lawyers
while
there
is
uncertainty
applications
will
be
made
denied
and
only
law
firms
will
profit
while
clients
lose
money
and
cftc
resources
are
exhausted
a
bright
line
rule
has
significant
advantages
over
product
by
product
determinations
regarding
the
term
gaming
i
agree
that
the
term
should
cover
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one

more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or

this
definition
should
be
clarified
to
include
other
contests
such
as
legal
adjudications
who
will
win
a
certain
trial
races

from

similarly
events
and
contingencies
based
on
cessation
of

reduction
in

should
also
be
excluded
from
the
permissible
subjects
for

products
whether
ukraine
joins

whether
a
bilateral
treaty
is
reached
and
perhaps
whether
humans
succeed
in

a
specie
extinction
simply
put
these
events
result
from
prices
too
idiosyncratic
to
analogize
to
products
traditionally
within
the
cftc
remit
under
section
products
based
on
these
types
of
underliers
raise
issues
of
moral
hazard
and
their
ability
to
assist
in
hedging
or
price
discovery
is
too
limited
and
instead
these
products
are
too
likely
to
be
used
for
gambling
gaming
in
addition
products
on
market
share
like
products
on
specific
merger
or
acquisition
transactions
as
well
as
products
on
factors
relevant
to
a
specific
firm
costs
revenues
or
other
financial
features
should
not
be
regulated
without
input
from
the
sec
as
insulation
from
court
challenge
products
discussed
in
this
paragraph
should
also
be
treated
as
products
banned
under
state
law
and
products
in
similar
activity
to
those
listed
in
section
as
a
reminder
while
many
states
have
expanded
legal
gambling
in
recent
years
some
have
not
and
as
the
proposing
release
notes
a
number
of
states
have
definitions
of
illicit
gambling
or
gaming
that
are
broader
than
the
proposed
definition
care
should
be
taken
however
in
prohibiting
products
that
involve
activities
that
violate
state
law
the
cftc
should
not
enable
one
or
few
states
to
shut
down
national
derivatives
markets
to
the
detriment
of
innovative
commercial
practices
the
suite
of
products
banned
under
any
section
rulemaking
should
include
products
based
on
any
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
law
however
subject
to
specified
and
narrowly
tailored
exceptions
the
scope
of
the
ban
should
not
cover
products
based
on
activities
that
are
unlawful
only
under
one
or
a
few
states
laws
as
a
bright
line
the
per
se
ban
under
section
may
be
imposed
if
at
least
ten
10
states
laws
ban
the
activity
with
contract
specific
review
applicable
where
fewer
than
ten
10
states
ban
the
relevant
activity
in
addition
when
defining
the
scope
of
prohibited
products
other
similar
activity
should
cover
events
such
as
fires
at
specific
locations
whether
or
not
due
to
arson
a
health
status
event
for
an
individual
such
as
illness
incapacitation
or

of
what
may
or
may
not
have
been
a
crime
these
kinds
of
adverse
events
are
best
left
to
insurance
markets
which
have
mechanisms
for
investigating
occurrences
and
distinguishing
between
bad
luck
and
foul
play
in
economic
terms
these
contracts
both
pose
moral
hazard
and
are
generally
unfit
for
market
listing
due
to
low
value
from
a
hedging
or
price
discovery
perspective
and
high
likelihood
of
noisy
pricing
to
be
clear
while
contracts
on
a
fire
at
a
specific
building
should
be
banned
contracts
as
to
the
number
of
significant
fires
in
a
geographic
area
over
a
period
of
time
could
be
permitted
again
there
is
a
line
drawing
problem
but
the
cftc
should
not
put
itself
in
a
position
where
inquiring
into
market
manipulation
is
synonymous
with
pursuing
traditional
law
enforcement
concerns
investigating
a
fire
as
potential
arson
in
the
course
of
an
inquiry
whether
a

participant
inappropriately
influenced

how
should
the
cftc
assess
public
interest
in
the
context
of
section
there
are
many
factors
that
inform
whether
a
product
listing
is
in
the
public
interest
and
these
factors
vary
by
category
of
contract
that
said
the
cftc
must
always
consider
whether
a
contract
serves
hedging
or
price
discovery
functions
when
assessing
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
permit
listing
of
the
product
on
a
designated
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
that
obligation
arises
under
section
of
the

which
provides
with
emphasis
added
a
transactions
subject
to
this
act
are
entered
into

and
are

a
national

what

is
also
implicitly
stating
what

are
outside

and
remain
subject

only
the

advancing
the

beyond

threshold
are
outside
of
the
cea
as
developed
in
my
draft
article
included
in
the
appendix
to
this
comment
letter
although
congress
referenced
specific
types
of
event
contracts
in
the
dodd
frank
act
when
it
added
section
congress
did
not
rescind
section
or
affirm
that
previously
authorized
contracts
were
consistent
with
section
the
public
interest
that
the
cea
is
intended
to
achieve
can
be
divided
between
managing
and
assuming
price
risks

and
discovering
prices
or
disseminating
pricing
information
enabling
cash

pricing
on
the
basis
of
prices
developed
in
derivatives
markets
this
statement
of
purpose
was
adopted
with
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
cfma
of
2000
at
the
time
it
replaced
a
statement
of
purpose
that
is
traceable
to
the
1920s
and
1930s
era
long
before
the
cftc
was
founded
and
when
commodity
derivative
regulation
was
in
service
of
agricultural
markets
while
one
may
argue
the
price
discovery
goals
referred
to
in
the
cfma
language
relate
to
aggregating
information
through
pricing
as
a
goal
in
itself
without
regard
to
cash
markets
as
background
economic
theory
drawing
on
hayekian
insights
sometimes
uses
the
term
price
discovery
to
refer
simply
to
the
capacity
of
markets
to
aggregate
information
about
supply
and
demand
through
the
price
formed
through
market
interactions
under
this
definition
any
price
is
itself
valuable
as
an
aggregation
of
information
many
prediction
markets
have
designed
products
so
that
their
pricing
reflects
dispersed
estimates
of
event
likelihoods
highlighting
the
value
of
a
market
set
price
without
more
however
price
discovery
in
this
hayekian
sense
is
foreign
to
the
cea
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
history
of
the
language
used
in
section
throughout
the
1990s
and
in
the
runup
to
the
enactment
of
the
cfma
regulators
and
other
professional
commentators
referred
to
discovering
prices
and
disseminating
pricing
information
as
functions

commodity

provide
a

to
construct

adjust

on
all
types
of

and
financial

cheaply
in

because
the

of
a

is
derived
from

for

there
are

their

them
for
the
privilege

under
the

under

to
be
clear
the
cftc
has
no
authority
to
regulate
a
product
that
does
not
have
significant
hedging
or
price
discovery
functions
just
as
the
cftc
would
have
no
authority
to
regulate
cars
or
avocados
should
a
designated
contract
market
or

facility
launch
sales
of
vehicles
or
vegetables
it
may
be
that
some
products
listed
on
one
or
more
regulated
platforms
do
not
qualify
as
commodity
interests
and
are
instead
subject
to
state

regulation
for
these
reasons
but
while
prior
self
certifications
may
have
been
lightly
reviewed
this
is
a
good
time
to
take
stock
and
reassert
the
boundaries
of
the
cea
in
this
regard
it
is
useful
to
reference
the
long
history
of
trading
in
futures
under
state
law
for
non
agricultural
products
until
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
act
of
1974
famously
expanded
the
definition
of
commodity
for
example
silver
futures
traded
for
at
least
half
a
century
outside
of
the
cea
and
instead
subject
to
state
law
event
contracts
like
other
products
that
do
not
exhibit
significant
hedging
or
price
discovery
utility
should
not
get
the
benefit
of
preemption
accorded
to
listed
products
regulated
under
the
cea
respecting
this
limitation
is
not
just
a
matter
of
legislative
prescription
it
also
reflects
sensible
policy
in
the
millennia
long
history
of
social
evolution
and
adaptation
markets
mediated
through
a
common
currency
are
an
epic
innovation
markets
are
capable
of
managing
supply
and
demand
and
enabling
mutually
beneficial
exchange
market
price
can
provide
substantial
insight
into
the
terms
at
which
exchange
is
mutually
beneficial
however
decades
of
study
have
identified
limitations
on
the
utility
of
markets
and
derivation
of
prices
in
particular
in
financial
markets
price
is
meaningful
to
the
extent
that
it
reflects
future
performance
of
the
relevant
financial
product
different
regulators
focus
on
different
types
of
financial
products
and
distinct
dimensions
of
product
performance
for
example
the

primarily
concerned
with
securities
securities

transacted
in
for
two
overwhelming
purposes
capital

and

regulators
are
primarily
concerned
with
balancing
the
entertainment
value
of
gambling
with
its
addictive
and
exploitative
potentials
while
minimizing
illicit

that

the

neither

defining
the
purpose
of
commodity
derivative
regulation
in
a
manner
that
was
verbose
and
focused
on
grain
products
but
conceptually
tracked
current
section
of
the
cea
through
a
focus
on
hedging
and
assisting
cash
market
pricing
it
is
worth
repeating
that
the
current
cea
statutory
purpose
as
reflected
in
section
is
substantially
the
same
as
the
purpose
of
the
original
grain
futures
act
and
that
legislative
history
of
amendments
to
section
shows
no
intention
to
depart
from
those
goals
instead
the
textual
changes
made
in
2000
broadened
the
language
beyond
grain
products
and
updated
archaic
phrasing
of
the
importance
of
futures
markets
for
hedging
in
the
agricultural
sector
and
establishing
prices
for
cash
market
transactions
in
that
sector
historically
the
primary
reason
commercial
market
participants
turn
to
futures
markets
and
later
option
and
then
swaps
markets
is
for
hedging
and
historically
there
has
been
an
important
line
between
products
governed
by
the
cea
and
gaming
market
integrity
relies
on
the
price
formation
mechanism
which
in
turn
relies
on
interactions
between
informed
traders
and
other
participants
in
the
market
these
interactions
may
be
direct
but
are
often
intermediated
through
market
makers
prices
become
accurate
in
financial
markets
through
traders
developing
and
trading
on
private
information
through
informed
trading
informed
buying
updates
prices
upward
and
informed
selling
updates
prices
downwards
informed
trading
however
can
not
by
itself
produce
substantial
market
liquidity
if
everyone
in
the
market
is
informed
and
knows
they
are
trading
against
other
informed
traders
rationality
will
dampen
willingness
to
trade
for
similar
reasons
where
accurate
price
must
be
based
on
information
that
is
only
available
to
a
few
potential
market
participants
is
guarded
as
a
terrorist
cell
may
guard
information
about
its
plots
through
threats
of
physical
harm
to
those
revealing
the
plot
or
as
a
government
body
may
guard
information
about
future
policy
through
disciplinary
measures
against
employees
revealing
such
information
reliable
pricing
is
unlikely
to
emerge
while
a
particular
trader
has
information
believes
is
not
known
to
other
market
participants
and
influences
future
returns
from
the
product
that
same
trader
also
knows
that
other
market
participants
will
take
the
opposite
position
only
if
they
hold
private
information
that
leans
in
the
opposite
direction
while
informed
traders
may
lead
to
more
accurate
prices
their
presence
in
the
market
suppresses
liquidity
instead
liquidity
derives
from
trading
that
is
motivated
by
other
purposes
in
other
words
price
tuning
through
informed
trading
relies
on
non
informed
traders
participating
in
the
market
for
purposes
other
than
to
make
profits
from
private

the
tradeoff
between
liquidity
and

in

has
been

through

millions

programs
which
result

of

these

take
place
not
because
the
savers
have
private
information
about
the
firms
issuing
such
shares
but
because
we
have
become
comfortable
with
the
premise
that
in
the
long
term
investors
receive
substantial
returns
for
parking
their
savings
in
public
securities
markets
via
a
passive
mutual
fund
that
tracks
a
broad
equity
index
these
investors
do
not
care
if
they
are
paying
a
few
dollars
more
or
less
for
a
particular
share
than
its
worth
because
in
the
long
run
they
will
receive
returns
far
in
excess
of
those
few
dollars
that
they
may
be
losing
to
exploitation
of
their
informational
deficiencies
this
liquidity
from
passive
investors
enables
informed
traders
to
make
profits
through
research
and
informed
trades
it
is
the
presence
and
substantial
liquidity
from
uninformed
investors
that
invites
informed
trading
ultimately
leading
to
improved
price
accuracy
in
public
securities
markets
similar
dynamics
take
place
in
gambling
contexts
gamblers
are
driven
by
entertainment
goals
as
well
as
addiction
and
other
psychological
factors
and
for
this
reason
do
not
care
that
when
they
wager
the
objective
expectation
is
that
they
will
lose
money
to
the
extent
there
is
informed
trading
in
gambling
markets
beyond
the
intermediaries
the
behavior
of
nonsophisticated
participants
those
gambling
for
entertainment
addicts
provides
the
liquidity
for
predictors
to
do
the
research
and
enter
the
market
the
same
tradeoffs
between
liquidity
and
price
accuracy
enable
successful
derivatives
markets
under
the
cftc
purview
informed
trading
follows
the
participation
of
traders
whose
first
priority
is
not
taking
advantage
of
private
information
as
to
the
future
performance
of
a
financial
product
historically
in
derivatives
markets
these
liquidity
generating
traders
have
been
hedgers
while
commodity
positions
can
be
used
to
track
inflation
they
do
not
typically
generate
beta
in
the
manner
of
securities
products
products
on
broad
based
security
indices
and
other
security
related
products
are
omitted
from
this
discussion
they
may
exhibit
dynamics
distinct
from
other
products
within
the
cftc
purview
and
may
deserve
separate
study
on
the
part
of
the
cftc
some

it

such

that
generate
liquidity
and
it
is
their

cftc

historically
have
generated
liquidity
from

and
thus
failed
to

although
it

not

i
have
looked
into
deeply
i
am

somewhat
skeptical
of
micro
contracts
as
well
because
few
retail

appear
to
be

for
retail
participants
at
the
same
time
many
of
the
new
contracts
settle
on
the
basis
of
newsworthy
events
that
receive
attention
from
amateur
prognosticators
unless
these
contracts
have
significant
hedging
utility
they
have
no
prospect
of
surviving
except
through
cultivating
a
mentality
among
retail
traders
that
engaging
with
these
contracts
is
a
form
of
personal
consumption
entertainment
education
these
are
not
the
purposes
cftc
regulated
markets
have
served
and
these
are
not
the
participant
goals
that
the
cea
is
designed
to
protect
the
cea
has
never
been
about
furthering
markets
devoted
solely
to
speculation
furthermore
this
business
model
on
the
part
of
exchanges
will
encourage
marketing
to
retail
investors
that
ultimately
undermines
public
faith
in
cftc
regulation
if
this
business
model
can
not
be
restricted
through
per
se
rules
such
as
those
being
considered
in
the
proposing
release
it
should
be
deterred
through
filing
fees
the
costs
of
experimenting
with
retail
products
are
too
low
given
the
impact
on
cftc
resources
and
derivatives
market
participants
one
approach
would
be
to
impose
substantial
fees
per
new
product
listing
where
part
of
the
fee
is
returned
after
the
platform
demonstrates
a
history
of
substantial
trading
in
the
product
these
fees
could
both
deter
exchanges
from
throwing
pasta
at
the
wall
in
product
innovation
and
offset
the
drain
on
cftc
resources
from
these
new
launches
to
sum
up
unless
an
event
contract
has
hedging
utility
it
will
either
a
fail
to
attract
liquidity
and
the
informed
trading
that
contributes
to
price
accuracy
or
b
come
to
rely
on
consumption
motives
among
retail
investors
for
its
survival
neither
kind
of
market
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
the
cea
had
in
extending
federal
regulation
and
preempting
state
law
where
there
is
a
genuine
question
as
to
whether
a
product
has
hedging
utility
it
is
reasonable
to
expect
that
the
platform
submitting
the
product
to
the
cftc
will
have
internal
studies
demonstrating
the
hedging
utility
as
part
of
product
development
platforms
interview
potential
customers
and
in
particular
the
community
that
may
use
a
product
for
hedging
purposes
for
example
in
launching
event
contracts
on
heating
and
cooling
degree
days
the
cme
interviewed
utility
companies
to
identify
the
temperature
at
which
air
conditioning
and
heating
systems
are
activated
thereby
arriving
at
the
65
degree
fahrenheit
baseline
see
cme
overview
of
weather
markets
available
online
at
a
degree
day
is
a
measure
of
how
much
a
day
temperature
deviates
from
65
degrees
fahrenheit
or
18
degrees
celsius
this
baseline
temperature
was
established
by
utility
companies
after
observing
that
air
conditioners
and
furnaces
are
usually
turned
on
when
the
temperature
rises
above
or
falls
below
this
benchmark
without
documented
interests
on
the
part
of
potential
customers
a
product
should
not
launch
regulatory
certification
or
approval
for
a
well
designed
product
with
bona
fide
hedging
potential
is
not
a
high
risk
proposition
and
thus
can
procedurally
follow
the
other
stages
of
product
development
if
at
the
time
of
regulatory
submission
there
is
a
question
as
to
the
hedging
utility
of
a
product
the
surveys
and
other
marketing
information
the
platform
developed
prior
to
submission
can
be
referenced
to
assess
hedging
utility
this
marketing
information
may
be
qualitative
but
frequently
includes
quantitative
components
the
cftc
should
engage
with
ex
employees
of
major
derivative
exchanges
marketing
and
product
development
departments
and
through
those
consulting
arrangements
obtain
a
realistic
understanding
of
the
internal
information
an
exchange
should
be
expected
to
have
substantial
upfront
fees
when
filing
a
product
followed
by
earnouts
based
on
product
usage
could
also
help
bond
exchanges
to
responsible
innovation
as
an
alternative
or
complement
to
ex
ante
evidence
of
hedging
utility
ex
post
data
on
market
utilization
of
the
products
could
be
used
where
an
exchange
can
submit
information
to
the
cftc
identifying
through
customer
data
how
a
product
is
being
used
to
hedge
the
exchange
would
be
refunded
a
portion
of
a
hefty
fee
that
is
paid
at
the
time
of
product
submission
via
either
the
self
certification
or
approval
pathway
to
clarify
first
at
the
time
of
product
submission
the
exchange
would
pay
a
substantial
fee
and
second
when
the
exchange
submits
evidence
of
customers
using
the
product
to
hedge
part
of
the
fee
would
be
refunded
exchanges
are
better
positioned
than
the
cftc
to
collect
customer
data
on
product
usage
and
are
likely
to
want
to
do
this
in
any
case
so
as
to
further
product
development
and
support
the
cftc
can
leverage
exchange
access
to
customer
usage
information
towards
assessing
hedging
utility
and
other
features
of
interest
before
moving
on
it
is
important
to
note
that
once
a
type
of
product
is
permitted
for
gambling
or
other
personal
consumption
purposes
there
is
a
natural
demand
for
hedging
this
kind
of
bootstrapping
should
not
be
permitted
for
example
once
a
number
of
states
legalized
sports
gambling
local
bookies
built
books
those
books
had
imbalanced
exposure
due
to
among
other
reasons
home
teams
generally
being
overly
preferred
by
gamblers
as
a
result
bookies
in
california
and
new
york
had
reason
to
offset
risk
through
swapping
exposure
with
one
another
and
narrowing
spreads
indeed
this
was
the
theory
behind
the
three
contract
types
erisx
tried
to
list
platforms
legal
under
state
law
draft
kings
fan
duel
caesars
however
should
not
be
able
to
always
turn
to
federally
regulated
derivatives
markets
for
hedging
commercial
exposure
for
this
reason
i
disagree
with
statements
from
ex
commissioner
berkovitz
on
the
erisx
certification
if
this
was
enabled
there
would
be
no
limiting
principle
for
example
if
a
state
or
foreign
jurisdiction
successfully
legalized
platforms
where
wagers
were
taken
on
future
wars
or
assassinations
those
platforms
would
have
hedging
needs
but
should
federally
regulated
derivatives
markets
serve
those
needs
i
think
the
answer
is
plainly
no
it
is
for
this
reason
that
gaming
and
a
number
of
other
items
were
carved
out
under
irrespective
of
whether
or
not
they
violate
federal
or
state
law
in
other
words
a
bona
fide
hedging
need
is
generally
a
necessary
but
insufficient
reason
for
approving
a
product
a
single
jurisdiction
legalizing
wagering
on
an
event
or
otherwise
permitting
an
anti
social
activity
enables
a
good
faith
argument
that
there
is
a
hedging
need
in
relation
to
positions
related
to
that
activity
but
this
should
not
be
enough
for
product
approval
the
utility
of
a
product
for
hedging
or
price
discovery
purposes
is
not
the
only
consideration
that
is
relevant
in
the
course
of
a
public
interest
analysis
as
cftc
regulated
derivative
markets
evolve
new
risks
need
to
be
considered
these
risks
will
vary
based
on
the
type
of
product
additional
considerations
may
include
concerns
regarding
moral
hazard
interference
with
states
police
power
the
competencies
and
resources
of
the
cftc
the
jurisdiction
and
authority
of
the
cftc
public
perceptions
of
regulated
markets
protecting
market
participants
from
fraud
and
manipulation
as
well
as
other
matters
of
market
integrity
the
reliability
of
prices
for
the
product
whether
relevant
information
is
available
only
to
a
few
individuals
is
guarded
as
secret
the
risks
of
corruption
or
perception
thereof
with
respect
to
public
and
private
bodies
and
other
matters
the
evolution
of
event
contract
products
poses
a
classic
case
of
where
law
struggles
to
keep
up
with
markets
changes
on
various
dimensions
including
technology
scale
commercial
practice
and
cultural
attitudes
to
financial
market
participation
have
prompted
products
that
challenge
assumptions
the
cea
and
its
regulatory
framework
have
been
built
on
the
cftc
has
a
difficult
role
in
making
the
cea
fit
new
possibilities
for
derivatives
trading
a
rational
approach
to
regulation
builds
on
information
and
enlists
the
assistance
and
input
of
interested
parties
i
applaud
your
work
and
appreciate
the
difficult
decisions
that
have
to
be
made
however
i
also
urge
you
to
invest
in
information
data
and
descriptive
resources
to
help
make
derivatives
markets
and
their
regulation
more
accessible
i
understand
the
cftc
is
strained
for
resources
however
the
website
has
deficiencies
that
make
it
difficult
for
researchers
such
as
myself
to
participate
in
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
processes
or
otherwise
enrich
the
regulatory
environment
for
example
the
cftc
purports
to
list
previously
approved
and
self
certified
products
however
the
data
the
cftc
provides
to
the
public
is
incomplete
among
other
things
the
cftc
database
fails
to
include
documentation
for
many
of
the
contracts
it
lists
despite
having
received
this
documentation
from
dcms
making
submissions
while
it
would
take
work
on
the
part
of
the
cftc
to
complete
the
public
database
of
designated
contract
market
products
the
cftc
would
also
benefit
from
third
parties
then
using
this
data
to
study
derivatives
markets
and
inform
the
cftc
as
another
example
the
commitments
of
traders
data
is
poorly
formatted
and
difficult
to
use
more
devastatingly
the
cftc
updates
the
data
on
a
weekly
basis
deleting
past
data
as
a
result
any
longitudinal
analysis
is
impossible
short
of
making
foia
requests
for
the
data
that
gets
hidden
every
week
when
new
data
is
added
it
would
be
relatively
easy
for
the
cftc
to
provide
the
commitments
of
traders
data
in
a
format
usable
in
statistical
analysis
packages
and
to
make
historical
data
available
in
other
words
help
well
meaning
researchers
help
you
the
cftc
is
uniquely
positioned
to
gather
and
disseminate
information
on
derivatives
markets
contributing
not
only
to
transparency
but
fundamental
understanding
i
believe
these
kinds
of
investments
are
worth
it
and
in
addition
to
providing
data
the
cftc
would
do
well
to
engage
in
concept
releases
that
revisit
and
organize
thinking
on
core
issues
informing
derivative
market
regulation
i
would
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
at

these
and

matters

the

industry
traces
its
origin
to
agricultural
commodities
trading
in
the
1860s
since
their
inception
futures
did
not
exist
for
their
own
sake
but
instead
to
assist

discussing
cash
or
spot
market
for
grain
for
example
early
wheat
futures
required
one
party
to
buy
a
specified
amount
of
a
grade
of
wheat
at
a
specified
time
and
location
and
the
other
party
to
sell
that
wheat
at
the
specified
time
and
location
part
infra
as
discussed
in
part
i
below
this
enabled
the
management
of
risk
and
establishment
of
prices
with
respect
to
transactions
in
wheat
all
over
the
part
infra
for
example
a
farmer
could
go
short
through
the
futures
contract
sell
the
grain
under
the
contract
to
neutralize
her
risk
that
grain
prices
fluctuate
through
selling
wheat
under
the
futures
contract
the
farmer
sells
at
today
prices
with
settlement
taking
place
in
the
future
through
an
exchange
of
the
referenced
commodity
for
cash
if
prices
for
wheat
increase
the
farmer
will
i
lose
money
under
the
futures
contract
because
the
price
of
wheat
at
the
time
of
delivery
under
the
futures
contract
exceeds
what
she
sold
it
for
but
ii
experience
increased
revenues
from
the
harvest
if
on
the
other
hand
prices
fall
the
farmer
will
i
profit
under
the
futures
contract
and
b
suffer
offsetting
losses
as
she
sells
her
harvest
at
the
lower
price
a
bakery
can
similarly
use
grain
futures
to
guard
against
prices
fluctuations
the
bakery
would
go
long
through
the
futures
contract
buy
the
grain
this
would
mean
that
if
wheat
prices
decline
the
bakery
loses
under
the
futures
contract
but
is
able
to
procure
its
ingredients
at
a
lower
cost
and
reciprocally
if
grain
prices
increase
the
value
of
the
bakery
futures
position
increases
although
its
procurement
costs
rise
these
examples
of
a
farmer
and
baker
using
a
futures
contract
are
quintessential
examples
of
hedging
risk
transfer
trade
in
futures
contracts
also

prices
how
much
do
parties
in
the

to
take
a

derivatives
are

invalidate
a

of
traditional

a

history
of
derivatives
regulation
the
origins
of
derivatives
markets
and
their

are
in
agriculture
and
in
particular
grain
from
its
outset
derivatives
regulation
struggled
to
draw
a
boundary
between
gambling
and
justifiable
speculation
in
the
context
of
financial
transactions
the
birth
of
futures
trading
in
the
united
states
the
chicago
board
of
trade
cbot
was
established
in
1848
initially
it
served
as
a
wholesale
market
for
grain
cbot
charter
permitted
it
to
set
rules
for
membership
and
these
rules
permitted
members
to
trade
on
their
own
behalf
as
well
as
on
behalf
of
customers
while
mandating
certain
practices
meant
to
facilitate
trading
within
a
few
decades
cbot
developed
sophisticated
trading
and
risk
management
processes
based
on
self
regulation
under
its
illinois
charter
among
other
things
cbot
introduced
standardized
contracts
that
required
the
delivery
of
grain
of
a
certain
grade
at
a
certain
location
one
or
more
months
in
the
future
at
the
price
prevailing
in
the
market
at
the
time
of
execution
in
this
manner
cbot
transitioned
from
being
a
cash
or
spot
market
where
execution
and
settlement
were
largely
contemporaneous
to
being
a
derivatives
market
where
traders
could
take
positions
based
on
future
prices
of
grain
and
transfer
the
risk
of
price
fluctuation
the
cbot
federal
regulation
preceded
the
regulation
of
the
first
stock
exchange
as
discussed
in
more
detail
below
these
standardized
contracts
came
to
be
called
futures
as
distinct
from
the
tailored
bilateral
agreements
for
future
delivery
of
an
asset
referred
to
as

forwards

a

believes
that
around

the

clearinghouse
the
board
of
trade

corporation
botcc
became
the
first
true
mechanism
for
addressing
counterparty
credit
risk
through
a
centralized
guarantee
system
which
other
futures
exchanges
came
to
emulate
pursuant
to
clearing
exchange
members
entering
into
a
future
transaction
effectively
split
the
transaction
into
two
one
between
the
first
member
and
a
clearinghouse
and
a
second
between
the
clearinghouse
and
the
second
member
the
clearinghouse
is
typically
an
affiliate
of
the
exchange
the
clearinghouse
acts
as
guarantor
of
both
transactions
standing
in
between
the
parties
and
standardizing
credit
risk
similarly
to
how
the
delivery
terms
of
the
future
standardize
market
risk
risk
related
to
the
price
of
the
referenced
asset
before
introducing
a
clearinghouse
to
manage
and
standardize
credit
risk
across
its
futures
cbot
employed
techniques
that
came
to
be
known
as
compression
in
settling
members
obligations
through
ring
or
multilateral
compression
members
would
identify
rings
of
redundant
obligations
and
cancel
them

were

to

through

a

on
a

price
of

changes
if
for
example
the
expected

goes
up
by
one
dollar
per
bushel
the
contract
price
should
increase
by
this
represents
a
gain
to
prior
purchasers
of
grain
delivery
under
the

and
a
loss

prior
sellers

margin
requirements
the
seller
in

if

exporter
is
obligated
to
deliver
bushels
of
hard
red
winter
wheat
in
six
months
at
then
prevailing
market
prices
the
exporter
faces
a
risk
first
she
does
not
have
the
grain
and
needs
to
procure
it
second
if
the
price
of
grain
declines
after
procurement
and
before
the
export
the
decrease
will
be
a
loss
to
the
exporter
to
address
these
circumstances
the
exporter
may
enter
into
two
transactions
first
the
exporter
enters
into
a
forward
purchase
agreement
for
the
bushels
of
wheat
at
a
fixed
price
six
months
ahead
of
the
export
obligation
second
the
exporter
hedges
against
price
declines
through
selling
futures
contracts
on
bushels
to
be
settled
in
six
months
time
pursuant
to
the
combination
of
the
forward
and
future
position
1
if
prices
for
wheat
increase
the
exporter
will
gain
based
on
the
differential
between
the
price
of
the
exported
grain
and
the
price
at
which
that
grain
was
procured
while
losing
money
on
the
futures
contract
and
2
if
prices
for
wheat
decline
the
exporter
will
lose
based
on
the
differential
between
the
price
at
which
the
grain
was
procured
and
the
lower
price
at
which
it
will
be
exported
while
profiting
on
the
futures
position
notably
1
and
2
only
note
that
the
performance
of
the
futures
position
dampens
the
gain
or
loss
on
the
commercial
transactions
the
combination
of
procurement
and
export
the
claim
is
not
that
the
futures
position
eliminates
the
risk
from
commercial
operations
that
is
because
of
basis
risk
which
refers
to
risk
that
prices
of
the
commodity
underlying
the
futures
transaction
develop
differently
from
prices
of
the
commodity
underlying
the
commercial
transactions
there
are
many
potential
sources
of
basis
risk
for
example
the
wheat
deliverable
under
the
futures
may
be
of
a
different
quality
than
the
wheat
the
exporter
must
ship
or
the
location
of
delivery
under
the
futures
contract
is
significantly
different
from
the
location
where
the
exporter
must
deliver
the
wheat
to
its
customer
and
this
difference
entails
greater
transportation
costs
or
the
delivery
deadline
for
the
future
and
the
forward
differ
these
types
of
slippage
in
pricing
between
the
commodity
in
its
commercial
settings
and
the
commodity
as
it
satisfies
futures
contract
delivery
requirements
mean
that
hedging
through
futures
addresses
risk
to
a
degree
and
that
degree
can
vary
in
this
respect
asking
whether
a
product
serves
a
hedging
purpose
is
somewhat
like
asking
whether
a
relationship
is
romantic
some
relationships
are
clearly
romantic
others
clearly

and
then
there
are
some
that
are
more

and
some

are

all
they

that

charged

wearing
the

of

nominally
putting
the

the

between

placed

placed

however
was
critical
brokered
orders
led
to
transactions
matched
through
the

of
an

that
transaction
would
be
with
a

decreased

understandably

the

against

on

holmes
made
three
observations
that

which
are

utility
of
hedging
to
commercial
market
participants
there
is
no
doubt
that
a
large
part
of
futures
contracts
are
made
for
serious
business
purposes
hedging
for
instance
as
it
is
called
is
a
means
by
which
collectors
and
exporters
of
grain
or
other
products
and
manufacturers
who
make
contracts
in
advance
for
the
sale
of
their
goods
secure
themselves
against
the
fluctuations
of
the
market
by
counter
contracts
for
the
purchase
or
sale
as
the
case
may
be
of
an
equal
quantity
of
the
product
or
of
the
material
of
manufacture
it
is
none
the
less
a
serious
business
contract
for
a
legitimate
and
useful
purpose
that
it
may
be
offset
before
the
time
of
delivery
in
case
delivery
should
not
be
needed

the

of
the

traces
to
the

and
the
role

it

only
the
cftc

of
1974
that
created
an
independent

modeled
on
the

to
regulate

markets

both

and
cftc

primarily
target
intermediaries
as

from
end

the
birth
of

coincided
with
the

it

the

that

those

guaranteed
by
the
gnma
which
effectively
has
the
backing
of

thus
is
not
subject
to

because
the
obligation
is

instruments
such
as

example
as
interest
rates
rise
the
value
of

declines

futures
as

further
below
pushed
further
on
the
traditional
role
of
cftc
regulated
futures
and
their
relation
to
cash
markets
the
eurodollar
contract
had
a
concrete
if
hypothetical
asset
it
referenced
for
purposes
of
calculating
settlement
price
namely
eurodollar
futures
settled
against
the
market
value
of
a
deposit
account
with
a
specified
balance
bearing
a
rate
of
interest
for
a
specified
term
the
deposit
account
was
an
asset
with
cash
spot
market
equivalents
namely
actual
deposits
made
for
specific
terms
in
london
and
other
financial
centers
outside
of
the
the
interest
rate
raised
a
complication
as
libor
represented
a
rate
synthesized
from
reported
interest
rates
rather
than
a
rate
observed
in
cash
market
transactions
however
because
libor
was
a
widely
published
and
used
reference
for
interest
rates
it
was
relevant
to
cash
markets
stock
index
futures
differed
from
eurodollar
futures
due
to
the
multi
component
nature
of
their
referenced
index
admittedly
an
underlying
asset
is
recognizable
in
the
context
of
an
equity
index
futures
however
as
noted
already
equity
index
products
involve
slippage
between
cash
market
value
which
includes
rights
to
dividends
and
voting
rights
and
the
value
of
futures
but
this
asset
has
a
composite
nature
the
asset
is
not
based
on
one
transaction
purchase
of
grain
purchase
of
a
treasury
bond
extension
of
credit
through
making
a
term
deposit
but
instead
related
to
a
large
combination
of
transactions
500
distinct
purchases
of
shares
from
500
different
firms
in
the
case
of
the
index
no
single
cash
market
is
related
to
the
futures
contract
or
is
substitutable
for
the
futures
contract
as
a
result
pricing
of
the
futures
contract
does
not
serve
as
a
reference
for
pricing
in
cash
markets
at
the
time
holmes
wrote
the
majority
in
board
of
trade
christie
grain
stock
farmers
wholesalers
exporters
and
others
used
prices
established
through
futures
trading
on
the
cbot
and
other
exchanges
to
set
the
price
at
which
they
sold
or
purchased
grain
this
function
of
futures
markets
continued
and
was
expressed
in
section
3
of
the
grain
futures
act
and
then
the
commodity
exchange
act
this
function
is
wholly
absent
in
the
context
of
equity
index
futures
and
other
futures
that
use
an
index
reflecting
the
price
of
a
multi
transaction
basket
other
index

drifted
even
further
from
traditional
links
between
cash
and

markets

although
economically
of

conceptually
this

further
expanded
the
cftc
jurisdiction
to
products
with
attenuated
cash
market
linkage
to
be
fair
there
are
specific
consumer
expenditures
cash
market
activities
that
compose
the
cpi
however
these
transactions
are
myriad
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
which
gathers
the
cpi
explains
that
the
cpi
represents
changes
in
prices
of
all
goods
and
services
purchased
for
consumption
by
urban
households
user
fees
such
as
water
and
sewer
service
and
sales
and
excise
taxes
paid
by
the
consumer
are
also
included
income
taxes
and
investment
items
like
stocks
bonds
and
life
insurance
are
not
included
the
basket
of
purchases
that
the
cpi
tracks
is
extraordinarily
broad
and
as
with
the
initial
freight
index
it
is
unlikely
that
any
market
participant
will
be
exposed
to
the
changes
it
tracks
with
any
specificity
moreover
the
cash
market
is
incomplete
as
there
is
no
ability
to
short
components
of
the
cpi
such
as
housing
costs
and
groceries
that
is
not
to
say
that
cpi
futures
can
not
be
used
to
hedge
they
can
albeit
only
for
the
relatively
short
term
period
for
which
futures
are
available
however
the
multicomponent
nature
of
the
index
aggravates
basis
risk
a
farmer
selling
one
kind
of
wheat
but
hedging
using
cbot
wheat
futures
knows
roughly
the
relationship
between
her
wheat
prices
and
the
prices
of
the
wheat
underlying
the
cbot
contract
however
an
exporter
using
biffex
contracts
to
hedge
a
few
specific
routes
carries
substantial
basis
risk
that
the
index
price
changes
due
to
prices
of
routes
that
are
irrelevant
to
the
shipper
similarly
someone
purchasing
a
cpi
future
may
find
that
the
cpi
changes
due
to
changes
in
the
costs
of
services
or
goods
the
hedger
does
usually
use
this
is
an
important
point
it
may
be
that
the
hedger
housing
or
food
costs
evolve
differently
from
the
housing
or
food
costs
reflected
in
the
cpi
that
is
traditional
basis
risk
distinctions
in
prices
of
grain
by
grade
location
or
timing
multicomponent
indices
however
raise
a
distinct
type
of
noncorrelation
it
may
be
that
the
cpi
includes
expenditures
that
the
hedger
simply
does
not
make
such
as
car
related
expenses
where
the
hedger
lives
in
new
york
city
and
relies
on
public
transportation
this
slippage
between
indices
and
actual
exposure
may
be
more
of
a
difference
in
degree
than
a
difference
in
kindagain
basis
risk
is
as
old
as
futures
however
the
attenuation
is
important
in
observing
the
expansion
of
the
cea
reach
suitability
for
investment
is
an
additional
dimension
along
which
agricultural
futures
for
which
the
cea
was
established
differ
from
the
futures
markets
the
cftc
enabled
by
the
end
of
the
1980s
investors
are
distinct
from
hedgers
and
speculators
investors
have
savings
which
they
seek
to
grow
at
market
rates
this
is
distinct
from
hedgers
who
seek
to
transfer
risks
incurred
in
the
course
of
their
business
or
other
activity
and
it
is
distinct
from
informed
traders
who
seek
to
make
above
market
returns
based
on
private
information
while
agricultural
futures
are
not
suitable
investment
products
futures
the
cftc
authorized
since
1974
have
features
that
may
allow
them
to
function
as
investment
instruments
derivatives
are
not
a
monolithic
asset
class
as
already
shown
and
will
continue
to
be
explored
in
reviewing
the
history
of
futures
authorization
products
have
different
features
and
have
evolved
over
time
the
underlying
a
futures
contract
are
important
for
understanding
the
behavior
and
potential
uses
of
the
contract
foodstuffs
are
perishable
goods
that
result
from
a
production
process
that
has
become
more
efficient
through
time
this
is
reflected
in
the
prices
of
agricultural
commodities
for
example
the
price
of
wheat
increases
by
less
than
one
percent
per
year
falling
short
of
inflation
while
agricultural
commodities
may
have
been
suitable
for
short
term
speculation
in
anticipation
of
sharp
supply
changes
war
crop
disease
weather
they
can
not
be
used
for
investment
as
a
result
people
do
not
use
agricultural
futures
to
park
their
savings
the
expansion
of
regulated
futures
to
other
tangible
commodities
as
well
as
financial
assets
however
expanded
the
potential
uses
of
futures
to
investment
annual
returns
on
gold
oil
government
and
private
debt
and
perforce
baskets
of
public
equities
substantially
exceed
returns
on
foodstuffs
figure
below
illustrates
returns
on
assets
referenced
in
popular
futures
contracts
to
provide
a
general
sense
of
how
vastly
their
returns
outperform
the
sub
inflation
returns
on
agricultural
commodities
investment
using
futures
products
is
admittedly
non
trivial
relative
to
investment
through
funds
and
cash
markets
an
investor
can
buy
shares
or
warehouse
receipts
for
tangible
nonperishable
commodities
and
hold
them
in
a
brokerage
account
alternatively
a
person
can
invest
in
a
fund
that
holds
these
assets
and
perhaps
other
assets
in
contrast
an
investor
using
futures
markets
has
to
regularly
incur
transaction
costs
as
futures
expire
settlement
takes
place
and
new
futures
have
to
be
purchased
this
is
particularly
true
as
typically
futures
with
longer
expiration
periods
have
lower
liquidity
and
higher
transaction
costs
putting
aside
these
practical
considerations
however
the
observation
stands
unlike
agricultural
products
the
assets
underlying
regulated
futures
after
the
cftc
was
established
became
suitable
for
investors
willing
to
take
market
returns
rather
than
just
cash
market
participants
seeking
to
hedge
and
speculators
seeking
to
outperform
the
market
this
was
a
reason
that
the
cftc
began
a
turf
battle
with
the
sec
which
had
traditionally
overseen
instruments
through
which
firms
obtained
capital
and
investors
allocated
savings

further
and
further

these
were

days
for
those
arguing
against

in

by
1995
the
interstate

commission
was
abolished
prior
to
that
the
berlin

fell
and
the

these

these

the

consisted
of

the

expressed

over

under

the

proxied

profitability
of
a

of
policies
it
was
a
ratio
that
captured
important
features
of
insurers
cost
and
revenue
structures
notably
the
index
did
not
purport
to
measure
profitability
among
other
things
it
did
not
account
for
investment
returns
from
the
premia
or
the
sales
and
administrative
costs
of
policies
the
index
was
not
based
on
the
price
of
any
product
instead
reflecting
a
partial
measure
of
financial
performance
premia
are
the
prices
of

however
the
index
was
not
based
on
premia
alone
rather
it
included
claims
histories
and
tracked
the
extent
to
which
premia
covered
those
claims
histories
contemporaneously
the
cftc
approved
similar
products
for
health
insurance
and

insurance
with
the
approval
of
these
products
the
cftc
effectively
announced
that

could
be

prices
in
the

period
hayekian
philosophy
concerning

bloomed
into

naturally
the
first
to

in

were
academic

in
june
1988
the

during

initially
the

electronic

was
called
the

market
the
market
offered
participants
a

of
four
contracts
it
sold
for
two
dollars
and
fifty
cents
there
was
one
contract
for
each
of
the
main
three
candidates
and
one
for

rest
of
the
field
market
participants
could
unbundle
and
sell
the
contracts
via
the
exchange
following
the
election
each
contract
would
pay
a
product
determined
by
multiplying
by
the
relevant
share
of
the
popular
vote
because
the
popular
vote
would
sum
to
100
across
the

the
bundle
of
contracts
would
necessarily
pay
at
settlement
however
the
price
of
each
individual
contract
within
the
bundle
fluctuated
based
on
how
much
of
the
popular
vote
the
referenced
were
expected
to
receive
for
example
if
a

received
10
of

the

market

they
would

the

the

the

the

the

the

prior

the

submitted
a
request
for
a

to
the

which
the
cftc
granted
on
february

notably
the

as
to
whether
iem
markets

a
component
of
the

proposed
a

on

of
major

these
were
clearly
linked
to

and
the
cftc
cautioned

that

as

that

these

in

that

also
received

to

various
options
referencing
similar

terms
with

based
on
crop
yields
of
specific
agricultural
products
in
specific
areas
yield
futures
demonstrate
both
a
gap
in
traditional
agricultural
futures
and
a
step
beyond
them
the
prototypical
farmer
could
use
traditional
grain
futures
to
hedge
against
fluctuations
in
the
price
of
grain
for
example
at
the
time
of
planting
the
farmer
could
enter
into
a
contract
to
deliver
bushels
in
the
september
or
december
following
the
summer
the
farmer
would
be
paid
based
on
current
prices
of
wheat
when
selling
those
futures
in
exchange
the
farmer
would
deliver
the
wheat
in
lieu
of
selling
it
at
september
or
december
prices
or
alternatively
offset
the
futures
obligation
through
buying
inverse
futures
at
the
time
of
settlement
and
then
delivering
her
grain
to
the
market
based
somewhat
on
the
price
of
the
offsetting
futures
this
enabled
the
farmer
to
shed
price
risk
but
this
transaction
did
nothing
about
yield
risk
or
the
farmer
uncertainty
as
to
the
volume
of
her
harvest
how
could
the
farmer
know
when
planting
how
many
bushels
of
wheat
she
would
have
to
sell
if
she
used
her
historical
averages
she
may
oversell
futures
in
a
bad
season
or
remain
partly
exposed
to
market
price
fluctuations
in
a
good
season
as
a
result
farmers
generally
waited
long
after
planting
to
get
a
sense
of
their
harvest
yield
before
hedging
price
yield
futures
addressed
this
distinct
source
of
risk
for
example
the
cbot
introduced
futures
covering
the
harvest
of
corn
in
illinois
within
specific
periods
the
cftc
approved
similar
contracts
on
harvests
in
indiana
ohio
nebraska
and
the
whole
of
the
united
states
similarly
it
approved
contracts
on
soybean
winter
wheat
spring
wheat
and
other
crop
harvests
these
contracts
were
designed
to
substitute
for
crop
insurance
that
was
already
available
at
the
time
of
the
futures
development
these
contracts
settled
on
whether
actual
yields
exceeded
or
fell
short
of
historical
averages
crop
yield
futures
were
not
price
based
instead
they
settled
based
on
growing
and
harvest
season
end
reports
of
yield
from
the
department
of
agriculture
the
unit
of
trading

were

purposes
to

but
as

the
extent

has
hedging
utility
is
a
question
of
degree
even
traditional

impose

risk
the
extent
to
which
a

evolves
inversely
with
a

exposure
is
a
highly
context
dependent
question
and
can
only
be
observed
in

with
all
the
defects
of
hindsight
bias
thus
conditioning
contract
approval
on
a
level
of
hedging
utility
poses
difficult
questions
for
the
cftc
the
cftc
could
obtain
assistance
in

these
complex
judgments
through
requiring
submission
of
information
developed
in
product
design
including
copies
of
marketing
studies
exchanges
conduct
when
assessing
whether
and
how
market
participants
may
use
a
proposed
product
how
are
the
lawyers
and
economists
at
the
agency
to
judge
whether
a
proposed
product
would
meaningfully
serve
market
participants
hedging
needs
to
what
extent
should
the
cftc
be
too
liberal
or
too
conservative
in
permitting
contracts
particularly
given
the
myriad
reasons
even
contracts
with
substantial
hedging
utility
fail
the
cftc
could
choose
to
err
in
favor
of
being
too
deferential
to
markets
and
approve
contracts
with
scant
hedging
functions
or
it
could
err
in
favor
of
being
too
strict
and
reject
contracts
that
could
have
had
substantial
uses
in
neutralizing
risk
instead
of
taking
time
to
reflect
and
formulate
a
comprehensive
policy
on

into

the

possible
explanations
for
the
cftc
failure
to
invest
in
long
term
guidance
one
story
would
point
to
the
cftc
being
resource
constrained
and
using
the
bandwidth
it
had
to
deal
with
pressing
demands
such
as
addressing
applications
from
market
participants
overseeing
registrants
and
enforcing
the
cea
cftc
employees
can
only
be
expected
to
work
so
much
and
the
cftc
did
get
budget
for
additional
employees
or
other
resources
and
the
chairs
and
commissioners
may
be
more
interested
in
delivering
high
level
talks
in
fancy
forums
and
preparing
for
their
next
career
step
than
analyzing
granular
reports
on
law
or
markets
from
cftc
staff
let
alone
engaging
in
the
difficult
systemically
nourishing
project
of
technocracy
another
story
points
to
how
the
cftc
benefits
from
approving
products
as
discussed
above
the
1974
amendments
to
the
cea
enabled
the
cftc
to
expand
its
jurisdiction
to
all
traded
futures
options
and
underlying
cash
markets
as
a
result
authorizing
novel
products
expanded
the
cftc
jurisdiction
making
the
agency
and
the
agricultural
committees
in
congress
more
relevant
this
helped
all
of
the
primary
decisionmakers
drawing
lobbyists
to
congressional
committee
members
and
creating
career
opportunities
for
those
at
the
cftc
the
industry
oversight
committees
the
chair
the
commissioners
and
staff
at
the
cftc
all
had
personal
reasons
to
grow
the
cftc
jurisdiction
through
expanding
the
range
of
regulated
instruments
moreover
growth
into
areas
traditionally
regulated
solely
under
state
law
as
opposed
to
products
within
the
sec
jurisdiction
or
relevant
to
the
treasury
or
banking
regulators
allowed
the
agricultural
committees
and
the
cftc
to
expand
power
without
wrestling
it
away
from
other
congressional
committees
a
third
story
is
that
consensus
was
simply
lacking
the
scope
of
contracts
that
could
be
approved
under
the
cea
is
not
obvious
and
requires
complex
judgment
informed
by
law
and
market
activity
there
is
genuine
and
substantial
room
for
debate
and
in
lieu
of
consensus
on
a
framework
the
individuals
involved
took
a
case
by
case
approach
the
fact
that
the
chair
and
commissioners
have
fiveyear
terms
and
typically
arrive
with
little
sense
of
priorities
and
more
frequently
than
one
would
hope
applicable
law
and
industry
practice
shortens
the
timeframe
during
which
investment
in
policy
could
take
place
even
if
there
was
an
appetite
for
it
whatever
the
explanation
the
result
was
a
step

step
expansion
in
the
permissible
types
of
contracts

the

supra
prior

that
it
that

would
allow
institutions

that

do

did

at

after
more
than
two
years
of
analysis
and
a
resubmission
the
application
from

was
granted
hedgestreet
was
a
unique
contract
market
when
it
was
formed
it
included
a
clearing
facility
which
was
approved
together
with
the
exchange
the
clearing
facility
was
trivial
because
of
how
hedgestreet
designed
its
contracts
as
detailed
in
its
rulebook
exchanges
seeking
cftc
designation
submit
the
rules
that
would
govern
trading
in

products
among
other
things
hedgestreet
listed
only
binary
options
hedgestreet
designation
at

describing
the
binary
options
that
hedgesteet
would
offer
these
were
contracts
similar
to
what
the
iex
had
designed
which
required
no
margin
or
other
sophisticated
risk
management
because
they
were
fully
prepaid
parties
to
the
contract
did
not
have
contingent
payment
obligations
because
of
how
the
binary
options
were
designed
exchange
participants
did
not
have
contingent
obligations
to
the
exchange
if
it
did
have
those
obligations
they
would
have
to
be
valued
and
collateralized
on
a
daily
basis
which
is
an
expensive
proposition
furthermore
the
exchange
was
relatively
cheap
to
operate
because
it
targeted
retail
market
participants
that
required
little
in
the
way
of
product
features
and
customer
support
and
could
be
obtained
through
internet
marketing
furthermore
because
it
was
all
electronic
hedgestreet
did
not
need
to
incur
the
real

and
other
expenses
of
running
trading
floors
hedgestreet
sold

bundles
and
supported
trading
in
the
individual

the
components
of
the

were
designed

all
potential
outcomes

goldman

operated
the
exchange
without
cftc
approval
i
believe
possibly
under
an
exemption
for
markets
with
only
eligible
contract
participants
a
class
of
sophisticated
persons
many
of
these
contracts
reproduced
futures
already
being
traded
on
cbot
or
cme
subject
to
one
alteration
instead
of
transferring
the
magnitude
of
risk
as
commonly
done
through
futures
the
hedgestreet
product
transferred
risk
in
a
binary
manner
for
example
these
products
although
purportedly
designed
for
hedging
did
not
distinguish
between
a
crop
yields
falling
short
of
a
threshold
by
a
little
or
an
asteroid
hitting

all

storms
causing
a

more
damage
than
the
threshold
and
an
unprecedented
hurricane
season
that
led
to
widespread
bankruptcies
among
insurers
and
general
economic
collapse
or
c
a
slight
softening
of
the
job
market
that
triggered
the
threshold
and
a
massive
loss
of
jobs
due
to
an
unprecedent
pandemic
such
as
covid19
the
hedgestreet
products
were
by
design
crudely
binary
and
aimed
at
retail
traders
while
it
is
difficult
to
say
that
the
products
lacked
hedging
utility
they
were
far
from
as
tailored
in
how
they
transferred
risk
than
preexisting
products
were
although
it
transferred
risk
in
a
crude
fashion
the
hedgestreet
product
model
did
have
a
justification
traditional
futures
which
expose
market
participants
to
continuous
ranges
of
risk
require
margining
the
same
is
generally
true
of
swaps
and
the
sale
as
opposed
to
the
purchase
of
non
binary
options
margining
among
other
things
requires
parties
to
a
futures
transaction
to
post
or
receive
collateral
on
a
daily
basis
see
24
supra
and
surrounding
text
the
following
example
illustrates
the
relevance
of
margining
to
traditional
futures
as
distinct
from
event
contracts
in
the
form
of
binary
options
consider
a
futures
contract
on
the
price
of
grain
if
the
futures
contract
is
executed
at
current
market
prices
of
grain
for
settlement
in
two
months
time
each
party
is
exposed
to
a
continuous
range
of
risk
the
party
that
sold
the
grain
is
subject
to
the
risk
that
the
price
increases
the
price
could
theoretically
increase
to
infinity
so
there
is
no
upper
bound
on
the
seller
exposure
no
amount
of
prepayment
would
be
sufficient
and
instead
derivatives
markets
have
traditionally
required
the
posting
of
variation
margin
to
cover
increases
in
price
as
they
occur
the
long
position
is
distinct
but
also
exposed
to
a
continuous
range
of
risk
prices
can
decline
which
results
in
losses
to
the
purchaser
up
to
a
maximum
where
prices
reach
zero
and
the
purchaser
loss
converges
to
the
price
at
execution
for
every
cent
the
price
of
referenced
grain
declines
the
purchaser
of
the
futures
loses
a
cent
there
is
precedent
for
prices
falling
below
zero
such
as
when
during
the
covid19
pandemic
oil
purchasers
were
paid
to
take
barrels
of
oil

although
a
purchaser
could
prepay
for
all
potential
losses
on
the
futures
by
initially
depositing
an
amount
that
would
be
deliverable
if
prices
reach
zero
for
efficiency
because
prices
rarely
fall
so
much
and
the
additional
capital
costs
on
futures
purchasers
would
deter
trading
that
historically
has
not
been
done
risk
management
generally
does
not
seek
to
eliminate
risk
but
to
adequately
mitigate
it

achieve
a
non

of

losses
instead
purchasers
like
sellers
post
variation
margin
as
prices
change
to
continue
the
example
consider
two
binary
options
instead
of
a
futures
contract
the
first
binary
option
pays
100
if
the
price
of
grain
is
below
6
bushel
at
the
time
of
settlement
the
second
binary
option
pays
100
if
the
price
of
grain
is
equal
to
or
above
6
bushel
at
the
time
of
settlement
these
binary
options
can
be
fully
prepaid
with
a
payment
of
100
plus
any
transaction
fees
this
is
the
structure
that
iem
developed
which
is
discussed
above
and
this
structure
does
not
require
margining
over
the
lifetime
of
the
trade
because
no
party
to
the
options
contract
can
incur
any
additional
liability
over
its
lifetime
the
maximum
payable
under
both
options
is
100
which
is
paid
at
the
outset
being
responsive
to
margin
calls
on
a
daily
basis
as
futures
require
is
expensive
and
not
something
retail
and
other
smaller
traders
can
generally
support
that
is
why
from
an
administrative
or
operational
perspective
binary
options
are
better
suited
to
retail
participants
the
costs
of
calculating
obtaining
transferring
and
custodying
collateral
are
avoided
making
the
products
cheaper
to
supportboth
for
traders
and
intermediaries
and
as
already
explained
binary
options
can
be
used
to
hedge
but
in
a
far
more
limited
way
than
the
futures
contracts
when
a
farmer
buys
options
that
pay
if
prices
go
below
6
bushel
and
sells
options
that
pay
if
prices
are
at
or
above
6
bushel
the
farmer
does
obtain
a
limited
hedge
the
farmer
makes
money
from
her
harvest
if
prices
increase
and
makes
money
from
the
options
if
prices
decrease
below
6
however
while
the
amount
she
loses
on
her
harvest
falls
continuously
as
prices
approach
0
per
bushel
the
amount
she
receives
as
compensation
on
the
options
does
not
change
the
payout
is
the
same
whether
prices
are
at
5
bushel
or
1
bushel
at
the
cost
of
additional
transaction
fees
the
farmer
could
use
binary
options
to
better
approximate
the
continuous
price
risk
she
faces
on
her
harvest
this
could
be
done
through
purchasing
additional
options
that
pay
if
prices
go
lower
for
example
one
option
that
pays
if
prices
fall
below
6
bushel
another
option
that
pays
if
prices
fall
below
bushel
another
option
that
pays
if
prices
fall
below
5
bushel
and
so
on
in
practice
however
these
strategies
tend
to
be
impractical
because
fees
on
transactions
are
high
and
the
distinct
strike
prices
at
which
contracts
are
available
are
relatively
far
from
each
other
the
price
risk
between
wheat
selling
at
6
bushel
and
bushel
is
significant
this
makes
the
hedge
relatively
crude
but
a
crude
hedge
may
be
better
than
no
hedge
if
a
trader
ca
access
traditional
products
as
is
the
case
for
many
retail
participants
if
products
such
as
those
developed
by
hedgestreet
can
be
justified
from
a
customer
perspective
this
is
generally
how
they
would
be
justified
they
offer
hedging
opportunities
where
practical
alternatives
do
not
exist
market
based
pricing
as
a

iii
why
most
event
contracts
are
ineligible
for
trading
under
the
cea
as
introduced
in
part
ii
in
the
early
1990s
the
cftc
began
approving
futures
that
settled
without
reference
to
market
prices
since
their
development
in
the
second
half
of
the
1800s
futures
contracts
had
consistently
set
prices
in
related
cash
markets
from
the
birth
of
futures
regulation
through
over
half
a
century
only
futures
that
referenced
actual
market
prices
were
permitted
this
began
to
change
with
the
approval
of
indexed
products
which
strained
and
ultimately
broke
the
connection
between
futures
and
prices
in
cash
markets
however
the
futures
without
connection
to
any
cash
markets
that
were
approved
in
the
1990s
retained
substantial
hedging
utility
at
least
on
a
theoretical
level
amp
france
catastrophe
futures
a
better
hedge
for
insurers
at
579
for
example
the
insurance
products
described
above
did
offer
an
alternative
to
reinsurance
for
unusually
high
losses
due
to
catastrophes
or
other
events
even
the
hedging
utility
of
futures
however
began
to
slip
in
the
2000s
binary
options
offered
a
design
that
traded
low
operational
costs
for
low
specificity
because
binary
options
were
prepaid
they
did
not
require
margining
but
the
binary
settlement
outcomes
that
enabled
prepayment
also
limited
the
instrument
hedging
utility
as
the
cftc
approved
products
with
only
attenuated
connections
to
the
public
interest
that
expressly
motivates
the
cea
a
question
arose
as
to
what
if
anything
the
products
the
cftc
was
approving
achieved
for
the
public
there
is
perspective
that
comes
with
reviewing
the
history
of
derivatives
evolution
each
step
away
from
statutory
assumptions
about
the
role
of
derivatives
looks
relatively
small
and
justifiable
but
in
the
aggregate
the
steps
trace
a
path
that
has
led
to
many
products
being
authorized
despite
having
scant
if
any
connection
to
the
goals
of
derivatives
regulation
the
cftc
has
ignored
its
decades
long
jurisdictional
drift
the
agency
should
undertake
a
review
of
traded
products
to
delist
those
that
have
only
attenuated
connection
to
the
purposes
of
the
cea
many
products
should
not
benefit
from
preemption
and
instead
be
subject
to
state
law
including
restrictions
on
gambling
one
could
argue
that
the
cea
jurisdiction
extends
to
products
that
do
not
serve
the
cea
stated
purpose
in
that
case
this
article
continues
to
be
valuable
primarily
in
two
ways
first
it
empirically
traces
the
trajectory
of
derivatives
evolution
in
the
preceding
part
ii
second
as
a
policy
matter
one
may
nevertheless
agree
that
the
cea
jurisdiction
should
be
limited
to
achieving
the
purposes
of
hedging
and
pricing
in
related
cash
markets
the
policy
reasons
for
extending
state
law
protections
are
reviewed
in
part
below
if
the
current
language
of
the
cea
is
insufficient
to
prohibit
authorization
of
contracts
that
fail
to
adequately
advance
hedging
or
pricing
goals
the
following
examining
whether
cbot
insurance
futures
can
substitute
for
reinsurance
products
in
managing
risk
language
could
be
added
to
cea
which
governs
the
approval
of
new
products
no
product
may
be
listed
under
the
cea
that
does
not
materially
advance
the
public
interest
of
the
cea
as
provided
under
section
3
hereof
the
rest
of
this
part
iii
considers
interpretive
and
policy
argument
against
this
article
proposal
that
the
cftc
relinquish
control
over
products
with
limited
hedging
and
pricing
utilities
so
that
they
return
to
state
regulation
these
arguments
stem
from
a
distinct
predictive
function
of
financial
products
which
the
iem
and
subsequent
prediction
markets
developed
before
turning
to
the
legal
and
policy
reasons
against
a
retrenchment
of
the
cftc
reach
the
predictive
role
of
financial
products
is
introduced
and
examined
how
financial
products
aggregate
information
and
enable
prediction
the
significance
of
price
is
a
central
and
illuminating
insight
in
the
study
of
economics
friedrich
hayek
is
a
standard
bearer
for
the
power
of
prices
to
aggregate
information
as
cass
sunstein
observed
in
2006
deliberation
is
one
way
to
aggregate
privately
held
information
but
there
are
many
other
possibilities
an
obvious
alternative
is
to
rely
on
the
price
signal
which
has
a
similar
aggregative
function
as
hayek
emphasized
the
price
mechanism
is
a
kind
of
marvel
because
it
combines
widely
dispersed
information
held
by
diverse
people
and
if
an
emphasis
is
placed
on
the
information
aggregating
properties
of
markets
it
would
seem
plain
that
to
improve
on
the
answer
produced
by
deliberating
groups
we
might
consider
an
increasingly
popular
possibility
create
a

the
importance
of
price
in
financial
markets
is
both
intuitive
and
heavily
theorized
as
quoted
above
writing
well
before
hayek
justice
holmes
understood
that
when
a
person
has
private
information
about
the
value
of
a
financial
instrument
the
person
may
profitably
trade
on
that
information
and
thereby
indirectly
share
that
private
information
with
others
as
pricing
adjusts
40
supra
and
surrounding
text
for
example
if
a
biologist
discovers
a
strain
of
poisonous
bacteria
spreading
through
american
wheat
fields
the
expert
can
buy
grain
futures
on
the
expectation
that
grain
prices
will
increase
due
to
diminished
supply
this
is
an
example
of
what
justice
holmes
refers
to
as
competent
speculation
or
prophesizing
that
leads
to
equalizing
prices
between
the
present
and
the
future
finance
scholars
have
long
studied
how
privately
held
information
is
absorbed
into
the
prices
of
financial
products
through
transactions
in
those
products
these
studies
which
will
be
expanded
on
below

from

and

supra
if
there
are

a

instrumentsone

the
first
outcome
occurs
and
the
second
paying
if
the
alternative
outcome
occurs
will
yield
expectations
as
to
the
two
outcomes
this
example
is
generalizable
to
where
there
are
three
or
more
potential
outcomes
through
separate
instruments
linked
to
each
outcome
as
iem
did
with
respect
to
1988
presidential
election
outcomes
provided
the
market
attracts
sufficient
liquidity
and
otherwise
functions
the
price
of
each
instrument
should
converge
to
the
product
of
the
likelihood
of
the
occurrence
and
the
payment
upon
the
occurrence
with
the
likelihood
being
based
on
traders
dispersed
beliefs
by
dividing

the

the

the

how

namely

and
ii

in

until
the

amended
the

in

these
twin
public
interests
were
unambiguously
the
justification
for
federal
derivatives
regulation
however
the
development
of
derivatives
markets
led
to
the
compact
abstract
and
arguably
ambiguous
language
of
present
day
section
a
transactions
subject
to
this
act
are
entered
into
regularly
in
interstate
and
international
commerce
and
are

with
a
national
public

or

information
through
trading
in

and
financially
secure
trading
facilities
although
this
language
from
the
cfma
provides
an
awkward
definition
the
national
public
interest
related
to
derivatives
should
not
be
construed
as
extending
beyond
their
contribution
to
hedging
and
cash
market
pricing
as
a
matter
of
logic
it
does
not
follow
from
section
that
if
a
transaction
does
not
serve
the
specified
public
interest
then
it
is
not
subject
to
the
cea
however
when
sense
is
added
to
logic
the
language
of
section
should
be
read
as
defining
transactions
subject
to
the
cea
as
exclusively
those
that
serve
the
public
interest
specified
in
section
pursuant
to
section
3
the
public
interest
in

markets
consists
of
managing

risks

these
phrases
are
considered
in
turn
one
may
argue
that
any
instrument
that
creates
risk
and
thereby
enables
a
party
to
assume
that
risk
satisfies
the
first
goal
on
reflection
this
position
should
be
seen
as
absurd
the
creation
of
risk
is
not
itself
beneficial
and
is
likely
to
be
harmful

in

although
assumption
of

is

that

is
combined
with
management
and
refers
to
the
fact
that
when
one
party
manages
risk
through
its

another

that

the

was

to

the

it

to

what
changes
in

markets
the

was
responding
to
by
the
time
of
the

other

primarily
swaps
had
become
popular
and
were
being

outside

frequently
as

the

notwithstanding
that
some

was
conducted
through

electronic

the

whether

for
the

for

required
it
was
the

that
introduced
the

and
in
context
those
terms
referred
to
the
discovery
and
subsequent
dissemination
of

relevant
to

it
is
possible
to
argue
that
predictive
instruments
enable
a
form
of
price
discovery
and
price
dissemination
specifically
these
instruments
by
their
design
aggregate
likelihoods
into
price
thereby
enabling
the
collection
and
dissemination
of
that
information
this
argument
would
recognize
a
novel
function
for

instruments
and
a
significance
to

price
that
congress
did
not
acknowledge
when
enacting

there

no

the

overviewing
irrational
determinants
of
financial
market
activity
uninformed
speculation
is
a
euphemism
for
gambling
however
in
the
context
of
financial
markets
gambling
is
permitted
the
reason
is
that
gambling
lubricates
markets
enabling
trading
for
other
socially
responsible
purposes
it
is
also
difficult
to
distinguish
gambling
from
other
market
activity
on
an
ex
ante
basis
so
it
is
hard
to
regulate
gambling
in
financial
markets
without
imposing
ex
post
penalties
on
those
whom
the
market
separately
punishes
gambling
in
derivatives
markets
subsidizes
hedging
and
pricing
just
as
gambling
in
securities
markets
subsidizes
capital
formation
and
investing
as
developed
in
parts
i
and
iii
however
the
permission
for
gambling
in
derivatives
markets
under
the
cea
is
not
limitless
it
is
conditional
on
the
instrument
serving
either
of
the
twin
public
interests
in
related
cash
markets
hedging
or
pricing
instruments
that
do
not
meaningfully
advance
either
interest
should
not
receive
the
benefits
of
regulation
under
the
cea
the
cftc
has
failed
to
articulate
boundaries
on
permissible
instruments
instead
taking
a

case
approach
to
product
approval
instruments
have

rather
to
the
extent
stock
index
futures
serve
the
goals
of
the
cea
it
is
because
they
have
hedging
utility
a
number
of
instruments
listed
since
then
may
lack
any
appreciable
hedging
utility
and
thus
represent
overreach
on
the
part
of
the
cftc
this
article
does
not
propose
a
means
for
measuring
the
hedging
utility
of
an
instrument
it
is
left
to
further
scholarship
the
cftc
or
other
policy
work
to
formulate
a
methodology
for
assessing
whether
the
hedging
utility
of
a
product
passes
a
de
minimis
threshold
that
hedging
utility
however
is
not
abstract
market
participants
know
why
they
are
purchasing
a
financial
product
and
disciplined
hedgers
track
the
performance
of
hedges
producing
records
that
show
the
inverse
correlation
between
a
variable
of
interest
such
as
revenues
or
costs
and
the
performance
of
the
hedge
such
as
an
event
contract
for
purposes
of
gauging
whether
continued
use
of
the
instrument
to
hedge
is
worthwhile
in
some
cases
it
is
clear
that
an
individual
is
purely
a
speculator
for
example
in
most
hands
a
contract
that
settles
on
the
basis
of
how
long
an
album
spends
at
the
top
of
the
billboard
200
is
speculation
there
is
no
identifiable
risk
that
is
being
offset
when
that
individual
is
a
member
of
the
music
industry
however
further
analysis
is
required
although
there
may
be
some
exceptions
in
most
cases
the
specific
and
binary
nature
of
the
payoff
will
prevent
the
contract
from
having
hedging
utility
but
ultimately
this
is
an
empirical
question
and
evidence
consisting
of
correlation
studies
should
be
considered
although
the
example
of
a
contract
settling
on
an
album
performance
may
be
an
easy
example
of
overreach
there
are
many
other
questionable
contracts
even
a
binary
option
on
the
reaching
a
specified
level
has
questionable
hedging
utility
this
option
has
no
capacity
to
distinguish
between
being
significantly
and
only
nominally
in
the
money
thereby
failing
to
neutralize
differences
of
degree
in
risk
manifestation
when
the
derivative
is
being
used
by
a
non
retail
audience
the
approach
to
measuring
hedging
utility
is
easier
firms
that
hedge
with
derivatives
typically
have
dedicated
analyses
to
tracking
products
hedging
performance
the
cfo
of
a
firm
or
equivalent
would
have
a
thesis
in
buying
a
product
and
test
that
thesis
over
time
that
thesis
and
its
assessment
can
be
referenced
to
understand
whether
and
to
what
extent
a
product
is
useful
for
hedging
the
cftc
has
access
to
information
as
to
whether
listed
derivatives
serve
either
hedging
or
pricing
goals
the
cftc
should
obtain
that
information
review
individual
products
starting
with
event
contracts
and
order
the
delisting
of
contracts
that
fail
to
sufficiently
support
either
of
the
cea
goals
a
subsidiary
question
in
this
analysis
would
be
whether
a
product
hedging
utility
should
be
assessed
in
a
standalone
fashion
or
within
the
context
of
other
hedging
products
in
other
words
a
product
that
has
hedging
utility
in
the
abstract
may
not
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
because
competing
products
are
more
adept
at
managing
risk
