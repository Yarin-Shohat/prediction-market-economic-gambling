betting
markets
are
useful
when
politics
is
chaotic
why
then
are
they
largely
outlawed
in
america
in
the
20th
century
for
brief
periods
the
most
frenetic
american
trading
pits
were
not
the
raucous
markets
in
which
stocks
were
traded
nor
the
venues
where
bonds
were
exchanged
the
real
action
was
in
the
market
for
betting
on
the
next
president
crowds
formed
in
the
financial
district
and
brokers
would
call
out
bid
and
ask
odds
as
if
trading
securities
write
paul
rhode
and
koleman
strumpf
two
economists
markets
were
deep
liquid
and
smart
in
15
presidential
elections
from
1884
to
1940
the
favourite
won
11
times
and
three
races
were
essentially
tied
in
odds
and
result
only
once
did
markets
miss
the
mark
lively
markets
in
political
betting
would
be
a
gift
today
since
they
have
taken
on
a
profound
importance
in
the
days
since
joe
biden
disastrous
debate
against
donald
trump
the
question
of
whether
mr
biden
should
drop
out
is
urgent
the
answer
influenced
by
his
chances
of
beating
mr
trump
polls
even
fast
ones
are
slower
than
markets
and
markets
moved
sharply
against
mr
biden
chances
of
continuing
in
the
white
house
and
being
the
democrat
nominee
before
recovering
a
little
in
response
to
the
president
obstinacy
see
chart
unfortunately
robust
political
betting
markets
all
but
vanished
in
america
around
the
time
of
the
second
world
war
owing
to
a
crackdown
on
gambling
and
the
rise
of
political
polling
today
they
are
mostly
illegal
since
it
is
thought
unseemly
to
sully
democracy
with
speculation
with
an
exception
for
not
for
profit
betting
exchanges
built
by
academics
to
generate
data
thus
the
only
betting
markets
that
remain
are
highly
restricted
operate
abroad
or
exist
outside
traditional
gambling
and
financial
markets
can
any
be
trusted
consider
academic
exchanges
first
the
main
restriction
on
these
is
that
they
must
cap
the
value
of
any
bet
at
500
on
the
iowa
elections
market
and
850
on
predictit
as
well
as
the
number
of
people
betting
on
any
question
as
a
result
crazy
bets
can
not
be
punished
by
a
big
trader
who
spots
an
opportunity
and
perhaps
not
by
anyone
if
limits
have
been
reached
venues
such
as
betfair
a
british
betting
exchange
are
populated
by
foreigners
who
may
be
less
well
informed
nate
silver
an
elections
forecaster
has
derided
taking
such
markets
seriously
as
checking
in
with
the
scottish
teens
there
is
a
crypto
exchange
run
on
ethereum
where
election
betting
takes
place
but
only
those
with
crypto
wallets
can
get
involved
all
these
suffer
from
what
david
rothschild
a
researcher
at
microsoft
calls
the
favoured
long
shot
issue
even
now
betting
markets
give
michelle
obama
a
5
chance
of
being
the
next
democrat
nominee
perhaps
her
chance
is
not
zero
but
it
is
close
to
it
these
bets
can
not
be
punished
by
big
trades
in
america
elsewhere
thin
markets
tend
to
lead
to
high
fees
which
eat
into
winnings
meaning
it
is
rarely
worth
taking
the
other
side
when
evaluating
mr
biden
such
problems
are
less
relevant
markets
might
not
price
ms
obama
appropriately
but
they
do
a
better
job
for
the
president
there
are
lots
of
bets
for
serious
money
on
his
chances
his
odds
shift
with
events
it
has
been
useful
to
know
in
real
time
how
his
chances
fare
it
might
be
even
more
useful
if
betting
were
open
to
all
let
crowds
form
in
the
financial
district
once
more
