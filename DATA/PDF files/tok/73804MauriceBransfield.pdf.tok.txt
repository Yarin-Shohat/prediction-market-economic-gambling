if

deter

prevent

background
event
contracts
are
binary
options
that
conclude
with
a
pre
determined
payout
based
on
the
outcome
of
an
underlying
occurrence
of
an
event
the
contracts
become
subject
to
an
additional
commission
review
process
separate
from
the
dcm
core
principles
and
other
requirements
if
they
involve
an
enumerated
activity
set
out
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
and
cftc
regulation
exchanges
are
prohibited
from
listing
these
contracts
where
the
commission
determines
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
the
proposal
would
alter
this
approach
if
adopted
all
event
contracts
involving
an
enumerated
activity
would
be
codified
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibited
from
being
listed
or
cleared
notably
the
commission
has
expressed
that
the
change
in
review
process
should
reduce
the
likelihood
that
contract
filings
that
raise
potential
public
interest
concerns
are
submitted
to
the
commission
event
contracts
proposal
at
emphasis
added
but
by
discouraging
registrants
from
proposing
or
listing
event
contracts
with
potential
public
interest
concerns
as
opposed
to
the
statutory
standard
of
being
determined
or
found
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
the
commission
has
introduced
additional
regulatory
risk
into
self
certifying
such
a
contract
and
furthered
its
chilling
effect
on
the
market
in
practice
pre
determining
that
all
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
with
an
arguably
broader
scope
due
to
the
breadth
of
the
proposed
gaming
definition
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
regardless
of
their
economic
purpose
or
pricing
utility
introduces
additional
uncertainty
for
cftc
registered
and
aspiring
exchanges
in
the
event

markets
space
as
well
as
unregistered
platforms
like
sportsbooks
currently
authorized
and
operating

under

the
proposal
follows
a
flurry
of
legal
and
regulatory
activity
impacting
the
event
contract
market
the
proposal
also
comes
in
response
to
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of

as

event

proposal
at
in
response
the
cftc
expressly
acknowledges
its
intent
in
the
proposal
to
reduce
the
amount
of
internal
resources
devoted
to
the
review
of
event
contracts
i
d
providing
that
from
a
resource
allocation
perspective
this
will
be
of
significant
benefit
to
the
commission
and
its
staff
since
in
the
commission

a
single
review
is
resource
intensive
and
consumes
hundreds
of
hours
of

the
cea

the

on
event

that
may
involve
an

activity
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
adopted
the
event

proposal
would
formally
alter
the

current

process
by
broadly
defining
the
scope
of

gaming

pre
determining
any
of
these

as
contrary

the

proposal
reiterates
the
commission
broad
interpretation
of
event
contracts
found
to
involve
an
enumerated
activity
more
specifically
the
proposal
finds
an
event
contract
to
involve
an
enumerated
activity
not
only
with
respect
to
the
contract
underlier
but
where
the
contract
also
involves
other
characteristics
merely
related
to
an

activity
event

proposal
at
stating
that
the
question
for
the
commission
in
evaluating
whether
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
or
prescribed
similar
activity
is
whether
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
involves
one
of
those
activities
the
interpretation
has
previously
raised
concerns
within
the
commission
with
some
commissioner
expressing
a
view
that
the
underlying
activity
such
as
political
control
must
itself
constitute
an
enumerated
activity
such
as
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
under
any
federal
or
state
law
for
the
commission
to
prohibit

ultimately
enacted
as

such
colloquies
are
often
used
during

to
engage
in
prearranged
discussions
between
two

more
senators
to
elaborate
on
specific

they
can
be

the
basis

the

that
an

must
be
considered
as
a

when
determining

it
then
proceeded
to
expand
the
definition
of
gaming
beyond
the
scope
defined
in
the

furthermore
the
proposal
does
not
mention
the
next
sentence
from

provides

regarding

that

these
types
of

would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
used
solely
for
gambling
defining
gaming
and
expanding
its
application
the
event
contract
proposal
would
codify
a
definition
of
gaming
for
the
first
time
in
general
the
proposed
definition
would
encompass
the
staking
or
risking
of
value
on
outcomes
and
occurrences
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
if
adopted
the
proposal
would
extend
the
reach
of
the
commission
event
contract
review
authority
beyond
its
current
interpretation
of
that
authority
this
expansion
is
most
notable
in
the
sports
betting
context
where
the
commission
event
contract
review
has
been
limited
to
game
outcomes
and
total
points
accumulated
see
for
example
the
cftc

and
the
third
on

nfl
games
available
at
the
commission
aims
to
reduce
the
number
of
individualized
contract
reviews
it
must
perform
but
notes
there
may
continue
to
be
instances
where
contract
specific
reviews
are
appropriate
to
evaluate
potential
gaming
contracts
event
contracts
proposal
at
relying
on
state
law
gaming
definitions
and
re
affirming
previous
interpretation
the
event
contract
proposal
defines
gaming
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
emphasis
added
it
is
difficult
to
reconcile
the
proposal
definition
of
event
contracts
associated
with
enumerated
activity
as
including
contracts
in
connection
with
enumerated
activity
with
the
cea
definition
of
event
contracts
associated
with
enumerated
activity
as
including
only
contracts
that
involve
enumerated
activity
applying
the
former
standard
will
likely
result
in
fewer
event
contracts
being
listed
than
suggested
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
specific
cftc
provided
examples
of
event
contracts
that
would
be
considered
gaming
event
contracts
include
the
following
i

which

in

including
the

importantly
the
commission
clarifies
that
certain
event
contracts
may
simultaneously
constitute
two

historically
the

has
used
an

notice
of

when
dealing
with
such
thorny
and
complex
issues
the

we
are

with

a

that
will
help
provide
some
much
needed
clarity
for
market
participants
this
could
be
significant
among
other
things
this
process
could
result
in
a
broader
array
of
event
contracts
being
categorically
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
inappropriate
for
trading
on
cftc
regulated
exchanges
relevant
factors
used
to
determine
activity
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
has
statutory
authority
to
determine
whether
a
contract
found
to
involve
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
event
contract
proposal
sets
out
several
factors
to
be
used
in
making
such
a
determination
which
will
predominantly
focus
on
a
contract
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
acknowledging
the
limited
legislative
history
of
the
event
contract
review
process
the
commission
relies
upon
the
colloquy
to
find
that
the
hedging
and
pricebasing
utility
of
a
contract
should
be
considered
as
relevant
factors
in
determining
the
public
interest
prior
to
2000
the
cftc
interpreted
contract
market
listing
and
the
public
interest
standard
to
include
an
economic
purpose
test
which
centered
on
whether
a
particular
contract
is
or
would
be
used
for
hedging
pricing
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
that
provision
was
removed
by
congress
with
the
passage
of
the
cfma
in
2000
and
there
is
no
longer
a
statutory
requirement
that
contracts
meet
a
hedging
or
price
basing
standard
to
trade
on
a
registered
exchange
the
commission
could
have
alternatively
interpreted
the
test
removal
as
establishing
an
intentional
omission
of
its
application
by
congress
such
an
interpretation
would
seem
to
be
more
in
line
with
the
semantic
canon
casus
omissus
which
generally
provides
that
a
matter
not
covered
by
a
statute
should
be
treated
as
intentionally
omitted

but
it
decided
to
conclude
without
support
that
the
cftc
should
consider
the
extent
to
which
a
proposed
derivative
contract
would
be
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
emphasis
added
comparing
the
colloquy
with
the
economic
purpose
test
the
event
contract
proposal
concludes
that
the
adoption
of
the
former
more
rigorous
hedging
standard
is
appropriate
event
contracts
proposal
at
in
assessing
the
hedging
or
commercial
interest
in
trading
an
event
contract
involving
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
finds
that
such
contracts
are
likely
to
be
traded
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
finds
that
such
contracts
usually
lack
an
underlying
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
increasing
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
acknowledges
that
the
trading
in
a
gaming
contract
may
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequences
but
believes
this
is
a
small
component
of
the
broader
universe
of
market
participants
expresses
a
view
that
retail
market
participants
are
most
likely
to
trade
for
entertainment
purposes
only
other
relevant
factors
include
national
security
and
the
public
good
the
extent
to
which
a
contract
brings
the
cftc
into
areas
outside
of
its
primary
regulatory
remit

characteristics
of
a

increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity

could
result
in
participants
profiting
from
harm

any
finally
when
reviewing
an

that
is
similar

the
