we
are
writing
on
behalf
of
the
coalition
for
political
forecasting
in
response
to
the
cftc
request
for
comments
on
its
proposal
on
event
contracts
the
coalition
for
political
forecasting
is
a
nonpartisan
nonprofit
organization
that
aims
to
liberalize
regulations
on
political
betting
in
order
to
serve
the
public
interest
the
coalition
advocates
for
a
community
of
researchers
traders
and
philanthropists
that
sees
real
money
prediction
markets
and
other
betting
platforms
as
advanced
forecasting
tools
that
can
help
humanity
navigate
an
uncertain
future
by
aggregating
and
refining
predictions
about
political
events
the
coalition
seeks
to
advise
the
policymaking
community
on
how
betting
on
political
events
can
improve
democratic
institutions
promote
economic
stability
and
facilitate
innovative
research

the
need
for
cftc
rulemaking
on
event
contracts
we
support
the
commission
decision
to
initiate
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
on
event
contracts
as
a
means
of
providing
regulatory
clarity
certainty
and
stability
in
the
space
the
cftc
remains
the
federal
agency
best
positioned
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
event
contracts
since
1992
when
cftc
registered
exchanges
increased
their
listing
of
event
contracts
the
commission
has
gradually
expanded
its
jurisdiction
over
the
space
it
is
true
that
event
contracts
do
not
fall
within
the
core
regulatory
remit
of
the
cftc
we
agree
for
instance
that
key
aspects
of
event
contract
regulation
would
be
a
better
fit
for
a
gaming
regulator
but
congress
addressed
the
cftc
authority
over
event
contracts
as
part
of
the
doddfrank
act
has
looked
to
the
commission
since
then
for
leadership
on
the
issue
and
has
shown
little
indication
to
roll
back
the
commission
jurisdiction
the
above
point
regarding
the
cftc
authority
over
event
contracts
is
critical
considering
how
frequently
the
proposed
rule
raises
concerns
about
the
commission
lack
of
specialized
experience
and
jurisdiction
on
questions
related
to
event
contracts
too
often
in
the
proposed
amendments
the
commission
cites
perceived
limitations
in
terms
of
its
expertise
and
authority
as
a
reason
for
curtailing
event
contracts
ironically
as
underscored
by
commissioners
mersinger
and
pham
the
commission
may
be
overcorrecting
by
exceeding
its
legal
authorities
in
restricting
event
contracts
given
the
absence
of
a
better
situated
agency
the
commission
should
instead
err
on
the
side
of
building
the
capacity
within
the
agency
to
manage
event
contracts
and
articulating
to
lawmakers
and
judges
why
an
updated
legal
regime
is
necessary
to
regulate
the
evolving
event
contract
space
the
cftc
should
draw
confidence
from
the
way
its
historic
regulation
over
event
contracts
has
allowed
the
space
to
mature
although
the
cftc
has
taken
a
restrictive
and
cautious
approach
to
regulating
event
contracts
it
has
also
provided
enough
leeway
for
the
space
to
develop
even
though
the
cftc
is
bound
by
a
regime
in
which
the
preponderance
of
federal
and
state
law
militates
against
event
contracts
the
agency
is
a
relative
outlier
among
its
international
counterparts
in
terms
of
how
much
it
has
permitted
event
contracts
to
be
offered
on
regulated
exchanges
platforms
with
no
action
relief
and
offshore
sites
the
iowa
electronic
markets
and
predictit
as
an
example
would
not
have
operated
with
regulatory
certainty
in
the
absence
of
the
cftc
no
action
letters
the
success
of
these
projects
has
inspired
entrepreneurs
to
build
event
contract
platforms
of
greater
sophistication
and
value
for
the
public
interest
we
disagree
with
those
who
believe
that
this
rulemaking
is
inherently
problematic
for
the
event
contract
space
in
light
of
the
commission
reservations
although
we
would
favor
a
more
laissez
faire
approach
to
event
contracts
than
what
the
commission
has
pursued
we
believe
that
a
lack
of
regulatory
certainty
and
clarity
is
perhaps
as
great
an
obstacle
to
the
development
of
the
event
contract
space
as
are
regulations
themselves
the
absence
of
clear
rules
has
harmed
the
event
contract
space
in
three
main
ways
first
it
has
deterred
market
entrants
from
participating
in
the
space
on
the
assumption
that
this
decision
would
entail
cost
prohibitive
compliance
measures
exposure
to
future
enforcement
actions
and
poor
returns
on
investment
second
regulatory
ambiguity
has
encouraged
market
participants
to
offer
and
wager
on
betting
lines
with
dubious
public
interest
benefit
thereby
inviting
not
only
regulatory
scrutiny
but
also
negative
public
attention

avoiding
regulatory
backlash
the
cftc
is
not
pursuing
rulemaking
in
a
vacuum
laws
regulations
court
rulings
and
precedents
are
not
the
only
factors
shaping
the
commission
decisions
as
they
pertain
to
event
contracts
the
core
dilemma
is
that
market
demand
for
event
contracts
is
growing
at
the
same
time
that
they
face
heightened
scrutiny
in
the
political
arena
the
most
politically
sensitive
event
contracts
those
pertaining
to
elections
are
precisely
the
ones
that
tend
to
draw
the
most
interest
by
market
participants
the
press
and
researchers
during
previous
reviews
the
commission
was
inundated
with
comments
by
members
of
congress
grassroots
organizations
and
powerful
lobbies
opposing
election
contracts
on
dcms
their
opposition
speaks
to
the
deep
and
widespread
fears
in
american
society
about
the
intersection
of
betting
and
democratic
institutions
as
reflected
in
the
strict
laws
that
govern
election
betting
at
the
state
level
chougule
and
sia

at
the
same
time
the
promise
of
event
contracts
is
being
realized
in
unprecedented
ways
event
contracts
related
to
elections
and
politics
are
thriving
primarily
due
to
the
efforts
of
companies
that
are
not
registered
as
dcms
that
are
not
pursuing
no
action
relief
from
the
cftc
we
believe
that
these
markets
would
be
more
efficient
if
they
operated
with
legal
certainty
and
were
more
directly
accessible
to
american
users
but
even
with
these
limitations
the
diversity
of
markets
that
are
now
available
and
the
volume
participation
and
attention
they
are
drawing
would
be
impossible
on
a
dcm
even
under
the
most
laissez
faire
of
commissions
we
continue
to
believe
that
event
contracts
on
elections
and
other
political
events
further
the
public
interest
however
we
disagree
with
advocates
of
event
contracts
who
are
encouraging
the
cftc
to
expend
political
capital
stretch
its
authority
and
test
the
limits
of
the
law
by
permitting
a
wide
array
of
political
event
contracts
this
is
because
the
greatest
threats
to
political
event
contracts
no
longer
come
from
cftc
regulation
more
concerning
is
the
possibility
that
highly
visible
deliberations
on
the
issue
at
the
cftc
will
harden
legal
precedents
against
event
contracts
and
invite
sweeping
restrictions
by
congress
that
usurp
the
cftc
prerogative
to
promote
responsible
innovation
in
the
event
contract
space
we
fear
likewise
that
enforcement
arms
of
the
government
will
seek
to
crack
down
not
only
against
companies
offering
event
contracts
but
also
users
on
these
platforms
indeed
the
highly
restrictive
legal
regime
in
which
event
contracts
are
mired
came
about
as
a
consequence
of
overzealous
industries
whose
poor
judgment
provoked
regulatory
backlash
in
the
form
of
laws
such
as
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
and
dodd
frank
we
therefore
encourage
the
commission
to
propose
amendments
that
are
not
only
consistent
with
the
law
but
are
also
attuned
to
a
political
environment
in
which
ignorance
strong
moral
intuitions
and
unfavorable
news
cycle
can
lead
to
overreaction
on
emotionally
charged
issues
such
as
election
betting
provided
that
the
commission
adopts
the
revisions
we
detail
below
we
believe
that
the
proposed
amendments
will
prevent
regulatory
backlash
allow
select
event
contracts
to
operate
on
dcms
provide
non
registered
entities
with
space
to
innovate
and
support
industry
actors
in
their
efforts
to
navigate
regulations
in
the
space
the
definition
of
gaming
as
noted
in
the
proposed
amendments
the
definition
of
gaming
as
it
pertains
to
event
contracts
is
ambiguous
while
we
favor
as
a
policy
matter
a
relatively
narrow
definition
of
gaming
we
believe
that
each
of
the
commissioners
as
well
as
lawyers
representing
the
cftc
kalshi
and
various
public
interest
groups
have
all
offered
reasonable
arguments
that
will
be
adjudicated
in
the
federal
courts
for
the
foreseeable
future
as
these
deliberations
proceed
we
would
encourage
the
commission
to
provide
clarity
on
two
of
the
most
important
types
of
event
contracts
that
could
be
prohibited
under
an
expansive
definition
of
gaming
mention
markets
one
is
mention
markets
among
the
most
important
event
contracts
for
the
public
interest
are
those
that
ask
whether
political
leaders
will
say
certain
words
on
occasions
such
as
debates
and
speeches
mentions
by
political
candidates
of
certain
companies
legislation
and
policy
agendas
can
provide
critical
clues
for
market
participants
seeking
to
hedge
or
otherwise
navigate
economic
risk
this
is
particularly
true
considering
how
sensitive
financial
markets
can
be
to
the
words
of
political
candidates
we
would
encourage
the
commission
to
indicate
clearly
that
these
markets
do
not
constitute
gaming
under
the
final
approved
amendments
legal
markets
the
second
is
markets
on
the
outcomes
of
legal
cases
we
are
pleased
to
see
that
the
commission
permits
kalshi
to
offer
markets
on
the
outcome
of
court
decisions
which
are
highly
pertinent
to
the
public
interest
4
we
are
concerned
however
that
an
expansive
reading
of
the
amendments
could
interpret
court
cases
as
constituting
a
contest
of
others
thereby
running
afoul
of
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
the
commission
should
explicitly
indicate
which
types
of
legal
markets
are
permissible
relatedly
it
would
be
helpful
for
the
commission
to
explain
why
legal
markets
are
acceptable
notwithstanding
the
perverse
financial
incentives
they
can
create
among
a
small
number
of
highly
influential
insiders
other
event
contracts
are
prohibited
on
these
grounds
despite
the
fact
that
the
alleged
perverse
incentives
to
manipulate
or
degrade
the
integrity
of
democratic
institutions
are
considerably
weaker
in
these
contexts
insofar
as
they
exist

to
be
clear
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
commission
should
prohibit
legal
markets
to
the
contrary
we
are
hoping
that
the
commission
will
bring
greater
clarity
and
consistency
by
treating
comparable
event
contracts
under
an
intuitive
regulatory
framework
economic
purpose
test
we
strongly
disagree
with
the
proposal
resurrection
of
the
economic
purpose
test
which
has
limited
relevance
to
event
contracts
the
proposal
relies
heavily
on
a
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
2010
there
is
little
evidence
that
either
these
senators
or
for
that
matter
the
staffers
who
may
have
inserted
the
language
into
the
congress
record
were
contemplating
dilemmas
associated
with
event
contracts
in
the
political
space
indeed
they
never
even
mentioned
elections
the
launch
of

was
more
than
four
years
away
neither
the
technologies
nor
even
the
concepts
on
which
crypto

exist
today
had
been
developed
the

and

utility
may
be
relevant
for
traditional
futures
markets
but
are
incidental
to
event
contracts
while
political
and
election
event
contracts
can
be
and
are
occasionally
used
for
hedging
and
price
basing
the
vast
majority
of
activity
in
these
markets
is
speculation
often
in
furtherance
of
price
discovery
risk
calculation
and
quantifying
uncertainty
over
the
past
two
decades
the
cftc
has
received
comments
from
distinguished
academics
and
market
participants
on
the
myriad
ways
event
contracts
relate
to
the
public
interest

novel

the
applications
of

are
continuously
being
explored

expanded
by
researchers

view
that

likewise
in
the
current
proposal
the
commission
concedes
that
approval
of
the
proposed
amendments
may
result
in
the
loss
of
informational
value
the
question
of
how
event
contracts
relate
to
the
public
interest
calls
for
a
test
that
is
far
more
holistic
comprehensive
and
nuanced
than
the
economic
purpose
test
our
recommendation
is
for
the
commission
to
oversee
a
separate
rulemaking
process
to
determine
an
appropriate
test
on
whether
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
believe
that
the
rulemaking
should
convene
after
the
2024
elections
the
commission
at
this
point
would
benefit
from
comments
that
draw
on
lessons
learned
from
the
performance
of
event

in

with
unprecedented

considering
the

strong
denunciation
of

markets
it
makes
little
sense
to
us
why
the
commission
is
explicitly
opting
in
the
proposal
not
to
define
war
in
many
of
the
most
consequential
conflicts
in
the
world
it
is
unclear
whether
a
war
is
even
occurring
without
a
definition
of
war
event
contract
platforms
will
have
little
guidance
on
whether
they
can
offer
markets
related
to
a
wide
array
of
current
events
proposing
a
clear
narrow
definition
of
war
would
help
mitigate
the
possibility
that
a
cftc
regulated
market
would
create
a
financial
incentive
to
carry
out
an
act
of
war
the
cftc
as
an
example
could
define
war
as
a
type
of
conflict
that
could
only
be
initiated
by
designated
leaders
of
a
country
through
formal
defined
government
processes
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
political
figures
decision
making
at
this
level
would
be
motivated
by
an
opportunity
to
profit
illicitly
from
a
small
investment
in
a
dcm
in
which
they
are
not
permitted
anyway
the
proposal
does
not
sufficiently
consider
that
event
contracts
related
to
war
could
be
designed
in
ways
that
would
be
highly
beneficial
to
the
public
interest
as
information
sources

making

for
example
migrant
flows
driven
by
international
conflicts
are
a
source
of
economic
risk
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
an
event
contract
on
a
question
like
the
number
of
refugees
entering
a
country
would
create
incentives
for
market
participants
to
carry
out
a
heinous
act
in
this
domain
much
less
how
they
would
act
on
these
incentives
yet
these
contracts
would
facilitate
price
basing
hedging
and
other
useful
information
in
furtherance
of
the
public
interest
we
assume
this
is
why
the
commission
already
permits
kalshi
to
offer
a
contract
on
the
number
of
credible
fear
asylum
cases
the
ongoing
conflict
between
russia
and
ukraine
illustrates
the
above
dilemmas
whether
or
not
the
conflict
had
escalated
into
a
war
was
a
matter
of
debate
in
the
early
years
of
the
conflict
when
russian
president
vladimir
putin
referred
to
the
country
intervention
as
a
special
military
operation
event
contracts
could
have
been
offered
on
the
question
of
when
if
ever
russia

that

the
commission
acknowledges
counter
arguments
that
were
offered
repeatedly
in
previous
comments
event
contracts
involving
occurrences
in
connection
with
political
election
contests
could
serve
as
a
check
on
misinformation
and
inaccurate
polling
stating
that
market
based
alternatives
tend
to
be
more
accurate
than
polling
or
other
methods
of
predicting
election
outcomes
the
commission
responds
by
noting
research
suggesting
that
election
markets
may
incentivize
the
creation
of
fake
or
unreliable
information
in
the
interest
of
moving
the
market
it
is
true
that
political
event
contracts
incentivize
both
attempts
at
manipulating
markets
with
misinformation
as
well
as
attempts
to
correct
inaccurate
information
however
available
evidence
suggests
that
incentives
to
correct
inaccurate
information
are
considerably
stronger
than
incentives
to
spread
misinformation
as
seen
by
how
quickly
markets
self
correct
after
reacting
to
these
sources
the
commission
has
never
provided
evidence
to
the
contrary
in
the
dc
federal
court
hearing
in
kalshi
cftc
for
example
judge
cobb
asked
about
the
economic
benefits
of
election

cftc
attorney
anne
stukes
responded
that
the
commission
determined
in
its
discretion
that
those
were
not
outweighed
by
the
very
serious
public
interest
stakes
regarding
election
integrity
neither
stukes
nor
the
proposed
amendments
explain
what
precise
balancing
test
the
commission
used
to
determine
the
relative
interests
on
both
sides
rather
than
prohibiting
election
contracts
on
the
basis
of
its
manipulation
concerns
we
believe
that
the
commission
should
develop
a
balancing
test
on
whether
incentives
to
create
inaccurate
information
are
outweighed
by
incentives
to
promote
truthful
information
of
value
to
the
public
interest
the
proposed
amendments
on
event
contracts
should
not
be
finalized
until
the
public
has
had
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
this
balancing
test
a
well
conceived
balancing
test
would
encourage
registered
entities
to
create
lines
that
further
the
public
interest
and
traders
and
other
market
participants
to
engage
these
contracts
with
integrity
implementation
timeline
we
strongly
encourage
the
commission
to
avoid
submitting
the
final
rule
amendments
for
publication
until
after
the
2024
elections
event
contracts
on
the
2024
election
will
provide
unprecedented
data
and
insights
that
should
inform
the
commission
deliberations
we
recommend
that
the
commission
provide
the
public
with
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposed
amendments
based
on
an
understanding
of
how
political
betting
markets
performed
in
the
elections
for
the
amendments
to
achieve
their
stated
goal
of
creating
regulatory
clarity
they
will
need
a
strong
bipartisan
political
mandate
this
will
be
difficult
to
achieve
without
knowing
the
outcome
of
the
2024
presidential
elections
this
election
is
unique
in
the
sense
that
one
of
the
major
party
candidates
is
a
former
president
whose
administration
oversaw
landmark
reforms
in
the
regulation
of
event
contracts
president
trump
is
exceptional
among
major
party
presidential
candidates
in
the
way
he
openly
and
frequently
references
political
betting
odds
on
the
campaign
trail
more
so
than
any
recent
presidential
election
a
contest
between
trump
and
kamala
harris
would
be
a
referendum
on
how
the
american
people
see
the
issue
of
political
event
contracts
differences
among
the
current
commissioners
fuel
perceptions
that
the
commission
is
divided
on
the
issue
of
event
contracts
along
partisan
lines
and
that
reforms
in
the
space
are
subject
to
change
depending
on
the
partisan
makeup
of
the
commission
while
we
agree
with
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
sentiments
in
the
open
meeting
that
the
commissioners
do
not
think
about
these
issues
through
partisan
filters
the
reality
is
that
the
historically
non
partisan
issue
of
event
contract
regulation
has
in
fact
become
more
ridden
by
partisan
divides
in
recent
years
as
seen
by
the
comments
the
commission
has
received
from
congress
we
believe
that
it
will
be
easier
for
the
commission
to
find
greater
consensus
on
the
issue
after
the
2024
elections
regardless
of
the
outcome
the
commission
is
more
likely
to
garner
public
approval
for
the
amendments
and
lay
the
groundwork
for
a
durable
regulatory
regime
if
it
waits
for
the
outcome
of
the
2024
election
integrates
lessons
from
the
elections
and
drives
greater
consensus
among
the
commissioners

is
hardly
unique
to
the
american
experience
many
countries
including
liberal
democracies
with
legal
regimes
electoral
processes
and
political
cultures
similar
to
the
united
states
have
undertaken
thoughtful
reviews
of
how
political
event
contracts
relate
to
their
electoral
processes
some
such
as
the
uk
and
australia
have
adopted
relatively
permissive
regulations
on
political
event
contracts
while
others
have
taken
a
more
stringent
approach
behnam
dubious
claim
speaks
to
a
larger
issue
that
has
undermined
the
commission
deliberations
on
event
contracts
the
totality
of
the
commission
reviews
on
event
contracts
have
been
undertaken
with
a
conspicuous
lack
of
curiosity
about
the
experiences
of
other
countries
not
surprisingly
the
proposal
does
not
even
make
passing
reference
to
markets
outside
of
the
united
states
we
believe
that
the
commission
should
convene
roundtables
with
experts
from
around
the
world
who
can
speak
to
how
their
countries
have
weighed
dilemmas
associated
with
the
relation
between
political
event
contracts
and
democratic
institutions
this
exercise
would
be
beneficial
to
the
commission
generally
given
its
growing
participation
in
international
initiatives
comparative
analyses
should
not
only
inform
any
amendment
in
this
space
but
should
be
explicated
by
the
commission
constitutional
objections
throughout
the
commission
review
of
event
contracts
critics
have
raised
constitutional
questions
that
the
commission
has
refused
to
address
in
our
previous
comments
we
have
raised
concerns
that
the
commission
regulations
on
political
event
contracts
violate
the
first
amendment
commissioner
pham
in
her
dissent
raises
compelling
arguments
pertaining
to
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
supreme
court
preemption
doctrine
the
commission
ought
to
address
these
constitutional
objections
as
part
of
any
final
proposal
responding
to
comment
letters
throughout
its
review
of
event
contracts
the
commission
has
not
engaged
sufficiently
with
arguments
raised
in
public
comments
the
only
indication
we
have
seen
that
the
commission
contended
with
our
arguments
came
not
through
the
commission
notice
and
comment
periods
but
rather
at
the
dc
federal
court
hearing
in
kalshi
cftc
where
jones
day
attorney
amanda
rice
referenced
our
comment
all
of
us
have
used
our
platforms
to
encourage
the
public
to
submit
comments
to
the
commission
on
the
assumption
that
the
agency
will
consider
them
in
good
faith
the
commission
failure
to
respond
directly
to
the
comments
that
we
and
others
have
provided
has
been
noted
by
high
profile
participants
in
the
event
contract
space
one
prominent
market
participant
told
us
that
he
now
regards
the
cftc
requests
for
comment
as
little
more
than
public
theater
and
is
looking
to
the
judiciary
to
provide
clarity
before
issuing
a
final
rule
the
commission
should
respond
directly
to
the
comments
it
has
received
doing
so
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
good
government
it
will
help
build
a
political
mandate
for
the
commission
final
amendments
markets
correlated
with
elections
even
if
the
commission
finalizes
the
amendments
demand
will
not
diminish
for
election
markets
this
creates
an
incentive
for
registered
entities
to
offer
event
contracts
that
are
ostensibly
about
economic
or
financial
indicators
but
are
so
highly
correlated
with
elections
that
they
function
as
proxies
for
election
contracts
the
commission
should
clarify
what
its
current
position
is
on
this
issue
and
how
the
proposed
amendments
would
speak
to
this
question
given
the
ease
with
which
correlated
markets
can
be
offered
and
marketed
we
are
skeptical
that
the
commission
could
effectively
regulate
them
out
of
existence
at
least
in
a
resource
efficient
manner
at
most
a
restrictive
cftc
rule
on
the
matter
might
create
transaction
costs
for
market
operators
in
reaching
low
information
retail
traders
enforcement
the
proposed
amendments
would
provide
clarity
for
the
relatively
small
number
of
market
operators
that
are
committed
to
playing
by
the
cftc
rules
inclined
to
err
on
the
side
of
caution
in
their
self
regulatory
responsibilities
and
willing
to
expend
the
resources
necessary
to
seek
commission
approval
in
our
estimation
there
is
currently
only
one
market
operator
kalshi
that
fits
this
profile
an
irony
of
the
cftc
approach
to
event
contracts
is
that
kalshi
more
than
any
other
market
operator
in
the
space
has
been
stymied
by
the
commission
those
platforms
that
have
chosen
not
to
register
with
the
cftc
and
avoid
or
evade
commission
rules
have
been
among
the
biggest
winners
in
the
space
the
demand
for
event
contracts
creates
incentives
for
market
operators
to
facilitate
investments
of
dubious
legality
by
offering
the
maximum
number
of
markets
possible
and
by
engaging
in
minimal
efforts
when
it
comes
to
enforcing
requirements
related
to
fraud
false
reporting
manipulation
market
integrity
and
other
cftc
concerns
this
dynamic
is
among
the
factors
that
led
to
litigation
between
the
cftc
and
predictit
while
finalizing
the
rule
would
impact
the
event
contract
space
the
ways
that
the
rule
is
enforced
in
our
judgment
will
prove
to
be
the
more
significant
factor
affecting
how
event
contracts
influence
the
public
interest
discussion
of
enforcement
is
conspicuously
absent
in
the
proposed
text
as
seen
from
the
commission
open
meeting
on
may
10
it
is
not
just
market
participants
but
also
the
commissioners
themselves
that
lack
clarity
on
the
enforcement
implications
of
the
rule
we
agree
with
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
that
the
refusal
of
the
cftc
enforcement
division
to
attend
the
meeting
is
very
disappointing
unacceptable
and
a
dereliction
of
their
duties
as
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
indicated
the
brief
statement
that
the
enforcement
division
submitted
did
not
allow
for
adequate

the
enforcement
division
absence
speaks
to
larger
issues
with
the
proposal
generally
it
seems
to
legitimate
the
points
commissioner
pham
made
in
the
open
hearing
as
well
as
her
dissent
about
the
need
for
reform
in
terms
of
how
the
commission
is
handling
rulemaking
processes
specific
to
event
contracts
it
indicates
that
the
commission
is
riven
with
internal
disagreement
this
is
neither
surprising
nor
problematic
per
se
given
the
complexities
and
uncertainties
associated
with
the
issue
indeed
the
absence
of
disagreement
would
point
to
a
more
concerning
lack
of
reflection
the
lack
of
agreement
within
the
agency
does
however
call
for
the
commission
to
take
a
slower
more
deliberative
approach
to
the
proposed
amendments
without
a
consensus
between
the
commissioners
the
staff
and
the
enforcement
division
of
the
cftc
the
commission
will
not
be
able
to
generate
enough
buy
in
for
the
proposal
to
create
stability
in
the
space
event
contract
regulation
will
instead
be
seen
as
a
tentative
political
question
that
is
up
for
grabs
depending
on
the
outcome
of
elections
and
the
make
up
of
the
commission
at
any
given
point
relying
on
tips
and
referrals
from
market
participants
for
the
underlying
information
sources
needed
for
enforcement
actions
presents
its
own
dilemmas
in
a
fledgling
but
competitive
somewhat
zero
sum
industry
this
type
of
enforcement
regime
creates
incentives
for
market
operators
and
aggrieved
traders
to
bring
opportunistic
complaints
to
the
commission
in
pursuit
of
market
advantage
we
believe
that
these
dynamics
have
been
at
play
in
kalshi
repeated
decision
to
draw
the
regulatory
attention
to
the
practices
of
its
competitors
a
business
strategy
that
dragged
the
entire
event
contract
space
into
a
political
quagmire
enforcement
actions
and
corresponding
litigation
in
the
event
contract
space
are
a
poor
use
of
the
commission
resources
while
the
commission
should
underscore
to
market
participants
their
responsibilities
related
to
self
regulation
it
should
also
set
realistic
expectations
with
congress
and
the
public
about
the
commission
limitations
in
the
enforcement
sphere
while
reliance
on
self
regulation
can
expose
the
public
to
risks
these
challenges
will
be
far
worse
if
the
commission
encourages
the
event
contract
space
to
migrate

response
to
cftc
request
for
public
comments
on
questions
related
to
kalshi
self
certified
congressional
control
contracts
we
are
writing
on
behalf
of
the
coalition
for
political
forecasting
in
support
of
kalshi
proposal
to
list
contracts
on
which
political
party
will
control
the
congress
the
coalition
for
political
forecasting
is
a
nonpartisan
nonprofit
organization
that
aims
to
liberalize
regu
on
political
betting
in
order
to
serve
the
public
interest
the
coalition
advocates
for
a
community
of
researchers
traders
and
philanthropists
that
sees
real
money
prediction
markets
and
other
betting
platforms
as
advanced
forecasting
tools
that
can
help
humanity
navigate
an
uncertain
future
by
aggregating
and
refin
predictions
about
political
events
the
coalition
seeks
to
advise
the
policymaking
community
on
how
betting
on
political
events
can
improve
democratic
institutions
promote
economic
stability
and
facilitate
innovative
research
all
three
of
us
submitted
comments
to
the
commission
on
this
issue
in
september
2022
our
previous
comments
address
most
of
the
questions
on
which
the
commission
again
seeks
public
comment
the
views
we
expressed
in
those
comments
have
not
meaningfully
changed
indeed
the
evolution
of
the
political
betting
industry
since
the
2022
midterm
elections
has
underscored
to
us
the
importance
of
allowing
kalshi
to
enter
the
space
in
this
comment
we
focus
on
providing
answers
to
the
commission
questions
that
did
not
appear
in
its
august
2022
request
we
hope
the
commission
will
also
find
informative

does
the

the

applicable
to

play
in
the

whether

or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
are
the
position
limits
reasonably
enforceable
the
minimum
order
sizes
and
position
limits
are
likely
to
deter
traders
interested
in
gaming
while
drawing
a
relatively
greater
degree
of
liquidity
from
skilled
traders
with
motives
other
than
gaming
such
as
hedging
of
the
three
categories
of
traders
delineated
in
kalshi
proposal
individuals
entities
and
eligible
contract
participants
individuals
appear
to
us
to
be
the
most
likely
to
enter
the
markets
with
gaming
motives
our
expectation
is
that
the
more
money
individuals
are
required
to
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
the
more
likely
they
are
to
approach
these
markets
either
with
a
long
term
edge
with
an
understanding
of
how
to
use
these
markets
for
hedging
and
price
basing
evidence
for
our
thesis
can
be
found
in
data
from
the
2020
elections
on
predictit
and
uk
based
markets
many
of
the
most
irrational
speculative
and
gaming
oriented
bets
we
observed
were
on
predictit
where
the
average
first
time
deposit
was
216
due
to
the
betting
limits
on
predictit
the
markets
had
limited
ability
to
correct
small
scale
speculators
who
wagered
on
highly
improbable
outcomes
such
as
the
possibility
that
trump
would
remain
president
despite
losing
the
election
as
the
markets
reached
new
heights
of
irrationality
the
gaming
frenzy
often
grew
traders
who
were
placing
these
types
of
bets
were
often
highly
vocal
on
social
media
where
they
broadcasted
their
wagers
in
the
hopes
of
eliciting
reactions
from
fellow
maga
enthusiasts
once
the
markets
were
settled
against
them
however
they
were
relatively
absent
from
political
betting
circles
on
betfair
exchange
by
contrast
which
does
not
have
position
limits
the
biggest
winners
were
smart
whales
who
took
advantage
of
mispriced
odds
driven
by
gaming
oriented
retail
traders
although
of
the
money
wagered
in
these
markets
was
on
trump
compared
to
for
biden
the
10
largest
bets
placed
on
betfair
were
for
biden
these
include
at
least
7
bets
on
biden
of
more
than
the
main
challenge
we
foresee
regarding
the
enforceability
of
kalshi
position
limits
is
the
unlikely
scenario
that
individual
speculators
will
falsely
claim
to
have
a
demonstrated
established
economic
hedging
need
so
that
they
can
wager
up
to
rather
than
being
limited
to
it
would
be
reasonable
of
the
commission
to
request
from
kalshi
greater
clarity
on
the
precise
means
and
methods
it
intends
to
use
to
exercise
sole
discretion
in
determining
whether
a
member
has
demonstrated
a
sufficient
economic
hedging
need
the
number
of
individuals
who
could
be
expected
to
wager
more
than
on
congressional
control
markets
is
relatively
small
and
only
a
small
percentage
of
those
would
do
so
with
a
genuine
hedging
need
especially
as
it
works
on
building
liquidity
on
its
platform
kalshi
could
be
tempted
to
accept
alleged
hedgers
with
minimal
scrutiny
more
transparency
on
kalshi
standard
would
also
set
a
precedent
for
future
market
participants
overall
however
we
see
minimal
concerns
regarding
enforceability
the
main
reason
is
that
kalshi
contracts
create
strong
incentives
for
self
regulation
at
least
in
terms
of
its
political
and
election
markets
kalshi
has
one
overwhelming
comparative
advantage
vis
a
vis
its
competitors
the
regulatory
certainty
it
can
provide
traders
by
virtue
of
its
status
as
a
dcm
and
its
strategy
of
hewing
closely
to
cftc
regulations
more
so
than
the
vast
majority
of
other
market
operators
in
the
political
betting
space
kalshi
in
our
assess
has
a
strong
motive
to
take
a
highly
conservative
risk
averse
approach
to
regulation
on
the
trader
side
the
small
number
of
individuals
seeking
to
wager
more
than
on
congressio
control
markets
can
easily
place
bets
on
other
platforms
with
far
less
scrutiny
of
their
motives
political
bettors
are
already
trading
political
contracts
on
a
growing
number
of
offshore
platforms
which
are
increas
keen
on
expanding
election
lines
as
vpns
and
other
technologies
advance
and
the
reality
becomes
clearer
that
the
government
has
a
minimal
capacity
and
political
will
to
pursue
enforcement
actions
against
small
scale
retail
traders
this
activity
will
likely
continue
to
grow
does
the
requirement
that
these
contracts
trade
in
multiples
of
5000
the
position
limits
applicable
to
the
contracts
affect
the
analysis
of
the
hedging
utility
of
the
contracts
we
believe
that
the
proposed
changes
to
the
contract
trading
requirements
bring
them
closer
in
line
to
practices
in
futures
markets
which
increase
their
likelihood
of
serving
price
basing
and
hedging
functions
although
the
vast
majority
of
political
event
contracts
are
used
for
speculation
we
have
seen
cases
of
retail
traders
using
these
markets
for
hedging
we
are
aware
of
young
professionals
for
example
who
use
kalshi
to
hedge
their
student
loans
our
concern
is
that
the
order
size
and
position
limits
will
deter
young
early
adopters
of
political
prediction
markets
from
exploring
their
hedging
use
case
with
small
amounts
of
money
if
kalshi
is
proposing
the
order
size
and
position
limits
at
the
request
of
the
commission
we
urge
the
cftc
to
grant
kalshi
more
leeway
what
is
the
price
forming
information
for
these
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
if
the
price
forming
information
includes
polling
and
other
election
prediction
information
is
that
information
regulated
how
does
the
price
forming
information
compare
to
informational
sources
government
issued
crop
forecasts
weather
forecasts
federal
government
economic
data
market
derived
supply
and
demand
metrics
for
commodities
market
based
interest
rate
curves
etc
that
are
generally
used
for
pricing
commodity
derivative
products
within
the
commission
jurisdiction
the
question
of
which
party
will
control
congress
is
determined
by
so
many
factors
that
the
price
forming
information
is
effectively
the
totality
of
the
american
and
global
political
discourse
the
vast
majority
of
price
forming
information
in
these
markets
can
not
be
regulated
by
the
government
polling
illustrates
why
price
forming
information
in
election
markets
is
nearly
impossible
to
regulate
polling
is
conducted
by
a
wide
array
of
sources
with
varying
degrees
of
reliability
and
motivations
even
if
the
government
were
to
find
ways
to
regulate
fraudulent
polls
it
would
need
to
contend
with
the
reality
that
it
is
often
not
polls
themselves
but
rather
the
interpretation
analysis
and
dissemination
of
polls
that
drive
market
prices
for
example
predictive
models
that
seek
to
turn
polling
data
into
quantified
forecasts
are
the
subject
of
trader
debates
due
to
the
way
they
weight
different
pollsters
price
forming
information
in
election
contracts
tends
to
be
based
more
on
qualitative
data
points
than
the
informational
sources
used
for
pricing
commodity
derivative
products
market
odds
of
a
party
controlling
the
house
and
senate
are
influenced
not
only
by
polls
election
models
and
other
quantitative
data
but
also
on
news
reports
and
political
commentary
related
to
national
trends
individual
races
and
other
potential
signals
opinions
and
analyses
by
a
wide
variety
of
experts
media
personalities
and
influencers
on
the
ative
strengths
of
weaknesses
of
parties
and
candidates
contribute
to
narratives
that
drive
movements
in
the
markets
this
is
why
market
prices
frequently
seem
to
be
incongruous
with
polling
and
other
data
price
information
in
congressional
control
markets
is
more
difficult
to
regulate
than
the
information
used
for
pricing
other
commodity
derivative
products
because
it
is
more
clearly
protected
by
the
first
amendment
predictions
broadcasted
by
politicians
pundits
and
other
political
commentators
inform
prices
in
election
contracts
even
when
these
predictions
may
be
misleading
in
the
sense
that
they
are
intended
to
shape
narratives
and
push
agendas
they
typically
can
not
be
regulated
because
they
are
constitutionally
protected
speech
should
and
if
so
how
would
the
registered
entity
listing
the
contracts
take
steps
to
address
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involving
the
price
forming
information
for
the
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
is
relatively
unusual
in
markets
on
the
control
of
congress
it
is
more
common
in
smaller
scale
lower
liquidity
markets
where
there
is
less
public
relevant
information
more
volatility
higher
degrees
of
uncertainty
and
short
deadlines
insofar
as
these
markets
would
be
targeted
for
manipulation
at
all
we
believe
this
would
happen
primarily
through
the
dissemination
of
misleading
news
reports
and
polls
given
how
quickly
market
participants
themselves
fact
check
these
sources
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
for
registered
entities
to
address
this
type
of
manipulation
more
effectively
than
the
markets
the
only
scenario
we
can
think
of
where
manipulation
would
have
a
meaningful
distorting
impact
on
price
forming
information
for
the
contracts
would
be
on
election
day
in
the
event
of
a
close
election
when
media
reporting
is
unreliable
and
jittery
traders
are
buying
and
selling
in
a
state
of
panic
manipulators
could
cause
major
movements
in
the
markets
the
easiest
way
a
registered
entity
could
address
possible
manipulation
is
by
refusing
to
host
discussion
boards
on
their
platforms
comments
sections
have
historically
been
among
the
most
common
vehicles
for
market
manipulators
to
affect
prices
on
predictit
the
amount
of
activity
in
these
comments
sections
makes
it
difficult
for
sites
to
police
them
do
kalshi
limitations
on
market
participation
affect
the
susceptibility
of
the
contracts
markets
for
the
contracts
to
manipulation
do
the
limitations
affect
the
extent
to
which
these
markets
could
be
used
to
influence
perception
of
a
political
party
or
candidate
or
otherwise
be
implicated
in
an
attempted
election
manipulation
are
the
limitations
reasonably
enforceable
in
rare
cases
political
insiders
buy
or
sell
positions
in
prediction
markets
to
manipulate
the
price
at
which
a
contract
is
trading
in
every
instance
we
have
seen
this
happening
this
manipulation
is
motivated
by
a
desire
to
generate
optimism
in
the
broader
political
conversation
about
an
individual
underdog
candidate
electoral
prospects
markets
that
are
targeted
for
these
efforts
typically
have
limited
liquidity
which
makes
market
manipulation
a
cost
effective
campaign
and
public
relations
strategy
we
are
highly
skeptical
that
anyone
would
have
sufficient
motivation
to
spend
the
amount
of
money
it
would
take
to
make
it
seem
as
if
the
republicans
or
democrats
have
a
marginally
higher
chance
of
achieving
overall
control
of
the
house
or
senate
the
nine
categories
of
individuals
kalshi
would
exclude
are
broad
and
diverse
the
degree
to
which
limitations
on
their
participation
can
be
enforced
likely
varies
depending
on
their
profile
employment
and
compensation
structure
the
important
point
from
our
perspective
is
that
kalshi
is
endeavoring
in
the
first
place
to
limit
market
participation
for
the
sake
of
advancing
democratic
norms
in
the
vast
majority
of
other
political
betting
platforms
market
participants
are
restricted
not
out
of
concern
for
election
integrity
but
because
they
are
winning
accounts
that
generate
more
accurate
odds
at
the
expense
of
bookmaker
profits
kalshi
decision
to
exclude
a
broad
array
of
market
participants
speaks
to
the
company
desire
to
work
with
regulators
to
assuage
concerns
about
the
threat
election
contracts
might
pose
to
democratic
institutions
if
the
cftc
prevents
kalshi
from
offering
these
markets
the
beneficiaries
will
be
other
platforms
with
few
qualms
about
enabling
election
manipulation
should
the
commission
be
responsible
for
surveilling
and
enforcing
against
possible
manipulative
or
false
reporting
activity
involving
the
price
forming
information
for
these
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
as
with
the
registered
entity
surveillance
and
enforcement
of
market
manipulation
by
the
cftc
would
generally
be
an
exercise
in
futility
these
attempts
would
serve
little
purpose
given
how
efficiently
kalshi
highly
liquid
congressional
control
markets
would
self
correct
there
is
only
one
type
of
surveillance
or
enforcement
we
believe
the
commission
should
take
responsibility
for
trading
in
these
markets
by
cftc
staff
a
strict
policy
prohibiting
cftc
staff
from
trading
in
these
mar
might
help
to
bolster
the
agency
credibility
as
a
regulator
it
would
assuage
doubts
that
commission
staff
have
a
motive
to
engage
in
manipulation
false
reporting
activity
in
these
contracts
could
trading
in
the
markets
for
the
contracts
obligate
the
commission
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
if
so
is
this
an
appropriate
role
for
the
commission
ever
since
chairman
behnam
raised
the
possibility
of
the
cftc
turning
into
an
election
cop
in
his
inter
on
the
odd
lots
podcast
we
have
interviewed
numerous
elections
and
compliance
officials
to
explore
this
issue
we
are
not
aware
of
anyone
in
congress
or
the
policymaking
community
who
believes
that
the
cftc
has
authority
to
be
an
election
cop
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
indeed
this
concern
is
so
speculative
that
it
provokes
suspicion
about
whether
it
is
merely
a
pretense
for
the
cftc
to
avoid
decisions
on
political
event
contracts
it
is
important
to
consider
that
the
cftc
has
had
oversight
over
several
political
prediction
markets
that
offered
contracts
for
the
2000
2020
and
2022
elections
in
each
of
these
years
election
disputes
were
litigated
across
state
and
federal
electoral
apparatuses
and
courts
notwithstanding
the
deep
widespread
and
in
some
cases
violent
public
reactions
that
these
disputes
engendered
they
did
not
require
any
meaningful
cftc
intervention
in
betting
markets
nor
did
they
even
generate
any
significant
legislative
or
public
demand
for
cftc
involvement
the
easiest
way
to
prevent
the
commission
from
becoming
involved
in
the
electoral
process
is
to
establish
clear
settlement
rules
for
the
contracts
we
believe
that
kalshi
and
other
political
betting
operators
need
to
prepare
for
the
possibility
that
election
disputes
could
leave
unresolved
the
question
of
which
party
controls
congress
well
after
election
day
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
commission
to
encourage
kalshi
to
develop
and
publicize
contingency
plans
for
this
scenario
clarity
among
traders
and
the
public
on
precisely
when
and
under
what
circumstances
the
contracts
will
pay
out
would
prevent
the
types
of
outcomes
that
could
invite
cftc
involvement
what
other
factors
should
the
commission
consider
in
determining
whether
these
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
perhaps
because
political
event
contracts
are
so
tightly
regulated
in
the

regulations
on

markets
today
are
more
uncertain
than
they
have
been
at
any
point
since
2014
the
prediction

community
has
so
far
failed
to
persuade
lawmakers
and
regulators
that
liberalization
of
the
space
serves
the
public
interest
argu
for
doing
so
have
been
undermined
by
the
mixed
performance
of
prediction
markets
in
recent
elections
the
national
political
environment
and
ineffective
business
deci
by
companies
in
the
space
while
the
congress
or
the

could
intervene
to
create
safe
harbors
for

liberalization
of
the
political

space
will
likely
require

many
of

the
refusal
of
the
states
the
district
of
columbia
and
territories
to
follow
suit
on
political
betting
leaves
unsettled
the
question
of
whether
the
political
betting
industry
could
pursue
a
regulatory
pathway
similar
to
the
one
undertaken
by
the
sports
betting
industry
somewhat
paradoxically
reporter
steve
bittenbender
who
has
covered
both
the
sports
and
political
betting
industries
extensively
believes
that
the
political
betting
industry
might
benefit
from
greater
federal
regulation
of
sports
betting
this
is
because
sports
betting
regulation
could
potentially
fall
under
the
purview
of
a
single
regulatory
body
such
a
body
could
in
turn
permit
sports
betting
operators
to
offer
political
lines
the
earliest
bittenbender
foresees
this
happening
is
in
the
run
up
to
the
2028
elections
ibid
creating
safe
harbors
for
political
betting
in
the
current
legal
regime
requires
regulators
and
elected
officials
to
adopt
controversial
positions
and
spend
considerable
political
capital
permitting
election
markets
could
expose
the
cftc
to
the
criticism
that
it
had
de
facto
preempted
state
laws
without
authorization
from

federal
and
state

advocating
for

in
the
absence
of

a
combination
of
personal
conviction
legal
precedent
and
bureaucratic
incentives
appear
to
be
steering
the

towards
a
restrictive
approach
on

there
appear
to
be
four
primary
considerations
weighing
on
their
calculus
first
behnam
is
disinclined
to
spend
the
political
capital
necessary
to
bring
clarity
to
the
space
in
public
remarks
in
october
2022
behnam
characterized
prediction
market
regulation
as
something
that
is
high
on
my
priority
list
ibid
however
policywise
his
higher
priority
as
commissioner
is
to
gain
new
funding
and
authorities
for
the
cftc
particularly
jurisdiction
over
the
regulation
of
digital
assets
delaying
a
decision
on
event
contracts
furthers
his
strategy
of
avoiding
litigation
or
confrontation
with
congress
and
the
public
while
he
pursues
his
priorities
second
cftc
officials
are
unpersuaded
that
they
can
allow
companies
to
offer
political
and
election
markets
in
a
way
that
is
consistent
with
federal
and
state
laws
and
that
advances
the
public
interest
even
where
the
cftc
has
opened
the
door
to
political
betting
markets
in
limited
ways
such
as
on
predictit
and
kalshi
the
cftc
has
struggled
to

and
other

dmo

interpretations
of

constricted
readings
have
prevailed
at

missteps
companies
seeking
to
offer
political
prediction
markets
have
made
strategic
choices
that
have
yielded
limited
success
in
liberalizing
the
regulatory
climate
the
choices
these
companies
have
made
have
led
regulators
to
approach
the
space
with
a
skeptical
eye
the
ways
that
they
have
navigated
the
regulatory
environment
are
not
only
questionable
in
retrospect
but
have
been
criticized
consistently
and
prophetically
by
a
wide
cross
section
of
the
political
betting
community
an
irony
of
their
missteps
is
that
they
are
replete
with
the
same
types
of
forecasting
errors
and
overreliance
on
experts
that
their
products
are
ostensibly
aimed
at
correcting
a

it
is
little
surprise
that
the
cftc
withdrew
predictit
no

letter
in
light
of
how
cavalierly
the

managed
its
relations
with
the

indeed
while
we
are
sympathetic
to

its

our

into

topic
left
us
wondering
how
predictit
even
managed
to
retain
no

relief
for
as
long
as
it
did
predictit
agreement
with
the
cftc
makes
clear
that
the
commission
was
granting
predictit
regulatory
relief
in
order
to
operate
a
non

educational
experiment
overseen
by
uni
faculty
which
would
offer
only
limited
political
event
contracts
whether
or
not
predictit
violated
the
letter
of
its
agreement
as
the
cftc
alleges
it
is
difficult
to
under
why
the
seasoned
washington
operatives
managing
predictit
concluded
that
the
company
business
practices
were
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
its
understanding
with
the
cftc
nor
is
it
clear
why
predictit
persisted
in
many
of
these
practices
even
after
being
confronted
repeatedly
by
cftc
officials
who
claim
unilateral
authority
to
rescind
its
no

chougule

cftc
makes
its

against

the

to
charge
fees
necessary

cover

operating

in
this
sense
the
rationale
behind

predictit

at

that

they

deter

phillips
conceded
the

distorting

nor
has
the
fee
structure
satisfied
cftc
concerns
about
whether
predictit
is
adhering
to
the
terms
of
its
no

letter
a
potential
explanation
for
why
predictit
persists
with
this
fee
structure
is
that
it
is
part
of
a
scheme
in
which
predictit
monetizes

its

he

that

that

at
a
time
when
cftc
commissioners
are
facing
criticisms
that
the
agency
is
too
indulgent
of
industry
interests
acquiescing
to
the
requests
of
kalshi
polymarket
and
predictit
all
of
which
retained
former
cftc
officials
risks
inviting
further
allegations
of
regulatory
capture
the
advice
these
companies
received
from
their
legal
and
political
advisors
likely
played
to
the
instincts
of
executives
who
were
prone
to
misjudging
the
regulatory
landscape
and
who
showed
little
interest
in
leading
grassroots
advocacy
campaigns
on
behalf
of
political

cftc
commissioners
lawyers
and
staff
as
an
example
made
frequent
public
appearances
in
forums
in
which
they
were
available
for
questions
and
conversation
these
events
proved
to
be
among
the
most
insightful
sources
of
information
during
our
study
they
provided
opportunities
for
candid
off
the
record
exchanges
with
those
close
to
the
decision
making
process
as
well
as
with
those
in
the
policy
community
and
in
the
public
with
an
interest
in
the
topic
yet
representatives
of
the
companies
rarely
attended
these
events
based
on
our
conversations
with
executives
and
lawyers
in
the
space
our
impression
is
that
they
were
too
quick
to
assume
that
cftc
officials
were
not
engaging
transparently
and
in
good
faith
in
their
public
appearances
and
that
engagement
in
these
forums
was
pointless
in
light
of
the
inside
tracks
they
believed
they
had
at
the
same
time
the
companies
have
failed
to
invest
sufficiently
in
their
advocates
in
the
prediction
market
community
they
have
provided
relatively
little
support
to
traders
content
creators
and
analysts
in
the
prediction
market
community
even
though
they
have
broken
news
with
limited
resources
their
analyses
have
proven
prophetic
and
their

has
drawn

attention

from
a

perspective
it
would
be
an
unfortunate
development
if
retail
traders
gravitate
to
offshore
books
the
business
models
and
incentives
of
offshore
sites
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
ways
comparable
to
prediction

many
bookmakers
move
aggressively
to
restrict
or

gamblers
from

political

they

in
this
respect

know
your

and
other
regulations
work

this
is
because
these
regulations
give
bookmakers
the
ability
to
deter
traders
with
a
perceived
edge
from
using
their
sites
by
burdening
them
with
onerous
intrusive
requests
to
verify
their
income
identity
and
other
information
while
there
are
offshore

that
are
committed
to
political

and
take
high
volumes
for
their
political
lines
such
as

and

the
tradeoff
is
often
big

that
are

the

liquidity
and

that

the
question
facing
regulators
is
not
whether

will
have
the
ability
to

but
rather
whether
prediction
markets
will
be
the
main
outlet
for
this
activity
liberalization
of
regulations
on
political
prediction
markets
before
the

will

require

the

be
simply
to

mersinger
also
notes
that
the

is
effectively
a
substitute
from
a

that
would
build
a
foundation
for

ibid
in
mersinger
view
the
unmistakable
take
away
for
dcms
in
the
absence
of
a
rulemaking
process
is
not
to
expend
resources
developing
innovative
event
contracts
because
the
commission
may
randomly
subject
them
to
a
public

without
providing
any
certainty

apply

congress
could

clarifying

position
on

the
most
likely
opportunity
for
congress
to
act
will
be
in
2023
as
part
of
its
deliberations
on
digital
asset
regulation
a
more
permanent
though
highly
improbable
legislative
solution
would
involve
repeals
of
pertinent
aspects
of
the
federal
wire
act
unlawful
internet
gaming
enforcement
act
dodd
frank
act
and
commodity
exchange
act
particularly
in
light
of
the
ftx
fallout
we
see
little
incentive
for
members
of
congress
to
complicate
legislation
on
digital
asset
regulation
and
other
pressing
issues
for
the
sake
of
a
contentious
debate
over
political
betting
markets
these
markets
generate
a
relatively
miniscule
amount
of
economic
activity
campaign
contributions
and
lobbying
pressure
when
compared
to
other
industries
kalshi
appears
not
to
be
making
a
strong
lobbying
push
in
this
respect
as
it
was
previously
considering
and
the
grassroots
activism
that
currently
exists
on
behalf
of
prediction
markets
is
likely
insufficient
to
overcome
inertia
in
congress
insofar
as
there
is
appetite
on
capitol
hill
to
act
on
this
issue
in
the
new
congress
we
believe
that
the
initiative
would
need
to
come
from
the
house
and
senate
agriculture
committees
as
well
as
from
massachusetts

kalshi
advocacy
as
well
as
the
comments
that
were
submitted
on

of

appear
to
have
overcome
some
doubts
among
agriculture
committee
members
and
staff
about
the
wisdom
of
approving
congressional
control
markets
the
possibility
however
that
senator
warren
will
publicly
denounce
political
event
contracts
is
among
the
factors
that
creates
political
risk
around
any
effort
to
advocate
for
liberalization
of
the
space
the
extent
to
which
the

has
been
influenced
by

and
her
office
on
issues
related

liberalizing

on

prediction
markets
in
the
united

and
creating
regulatory
certainty

space
in
all
likelihood
will

achieving
this
goal
by

could
be
a
reasonable
target
but
it
also
could
take
considerably
longer
depending
on
an
array
of
factors
below
are
areas
we
suggest
prioritizing
for
those
who
are
committed
to
the
challenge
contribute
to
cftc
public
comment
periods
in
the
current
regulatory
framework
the
cftc
is
the
agency
best
situated
to
liberalize
regulations
on
political
prediction
markets
public
comment
periods
commenced
by
the
cftc
on
event
contracts
gaming
and
related
issues
provide
opportunities
to
deliver
arguments
on
behalf
of
political
betting
markets
directly
to
the
most
powerful
regulators
with
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
cftc
comment
periods
are
the
rare
occasions
on
which
senior
officials
in
the
government
dedicate
time
and
resources
to
engage
on
this
issue
which
is
typically
niche
and
rarely
breaks
into
the
news
cycle
that
the
cftc
is
staffed
disproportionately
by
lawyers
helps
ensure
that
even
long
complex
comments
are
considered
by
government
officials
who
have
the
training
and
inclination
to
engage
complicated
issues
deliberately
the
questions
on
which
the
cftc
seeks
public
comment
are
highly
specific
and
indicative
of
the
concerns
weighing
on
regulators
concerns
that
otherwise
are
often
not
publicized
even
during
periods
when
the
cftc
leadership
is
inclined
toward
inaction
the
process
of
submitting
comments
contributes
to
the
long
term
effort
to
liberalize
regulations
formulating
responses
to
the
cftc
questions
spurs
dialogue
and
collaboration
which
leads
the
political
betting
community
to
refine
arguments
and
explore
areas
of
both
consensus
and
disagreement
the
comments
generate
earned
media
and
in
the
absence
of
clear
polling
and
other
metrics
the
quantity
quality
and
sources
of
the
comments
are
treated
as
a
barometer
of
public
sentiment
on
the
issue
the
totality
of
public
comments
submitted
to
the
cftc
on
event
contracts
notably
in
2008
and
2022
are
arguably
among
the
most
influential
body
of
work
that
the
political
betting
community
has
produced
for
the
direct
consumption
of
regulators
as

by

the

invest

platforms
to

potential

we

has
achieved
all
five
the
suboptimal
business
decisions
that
predictit
polymarket
and
kalshi
have
made
in
our
assessment
may
have
stemmed
from
the
fact
that
they
lacked
competitive
pressure
in
the
market
each
company
in
different
ways
tried
to
gain

mover
advantage
among
a
small
pool
of
competitors
in
an
uncertain
regulatory
environment
their
strategies
were
understandable
but
proved
imprudent
greater
competition
will
allow
for
more
innovation
in
all
respects
including
in
the
management
of
political
and
legal
risk
if
the
number
of
market
participants
with
a

greater
