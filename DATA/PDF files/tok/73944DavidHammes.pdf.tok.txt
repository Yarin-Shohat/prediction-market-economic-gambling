to
the
honorable
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
with
respect
to
event
contracts
and
rin
number
3038
af14
i
respectfully
request
that
you
cease
this
proposal
to
prevent
us
residents
from
participating
in
markets
for
the
following
reasons
1
this
was
an
incredibly
useful
learning
and
teaching
tool
for
me
when
i
was
teaching
financial
and
other
markets
as
a
professor
of
economics
at
the
university
of
hawaii
hilo
2
predictit
is
approaching
its
10
year
anniversary
making
it
one
of
the
biggest
and
longest
running
prediction
markets
in
american
history
3
for
people
who
do
know
predictit
works
by
drawing
in
thousands
of
individuals
who
buy
shares
of
a
contract
such
as
will
donald
trump
win
the
2024
us
presidential
election
at
a
price
between
and
1
each
contract
will
resolve
for
either
0
or
1
the
number
of
cents
per
contract
the
current
price
reflects
the
probability
that
the
contract
will
resolve
as
yes
in
effect
this
is
a
crowdsourced
probabilistic
forecast
4
predictit
trades
are
capped
at
850
per
user
per
contract
this
helps
to
keep
the
market
small
scale
and
ensures
that
wealthy
individuals
can
not
manipulate
markets
this
protects
the
sanctity
of
the
crowdsourcing
process
and
differentiates
predictit
from
other
financial
markets
that
are
dominated
by
hedge
funds
and
institutional
investors
5
in
its
10
year
history
predictit
has
made
these
crowdsourced
probabilistic
forecasts
available
to
the
public
and
makes
anonymized
trade
data
available
to
researchers
who
study
patterns
in
the
data
6
research
shows
that
these
forecasts
are
generally
accurate
and
are
generally
more
accurate
than
polling
especially
earlier
in
a
race
this
is
because
polls
are
a
snapshot
in
time
but
prediction
markets
allow
users
to
weigh
the
effect
of
factors
the
criminal
conviction
of
a
presidential
candidate
for
example
that
have
not
yet
fully
resonated
with
voters
7
because
of
its
accuracy
predictit
data
is
widely
cited
by
media
campaigns
and
financial
institutions
and
even
appears
on
the
bloomberg
terminal
8
the
research
also
shows
that
predictit
makes
users
more
likely
to
seek
out
factual
information
about
current
events
users
who
build
trading
strategies
around
factual
events
tend
to
do
better
than
those
who
trade
based
on
their
ideologies
or
misinformation
one
study
found
that
a
prediction
market
relating
to
climate
reduced
participants
skepticism
of
climate
change
in
an
era
where
both
liberal
and
conservative
commentators
are
alarmed
at
the
public
acceptance
of
fake
news
and
misinformation
these
markets
are
one
of
the
few
mechanisms
left
for
incentivizing
the
accumulation
of
true
and
accurate
information
an
antidote
to
fake
news
9
despite
the
inherent
public
good
that
these
markets
offer
the
cftc
is
currently
on
the
warpath
against
prediction
markets
the
cftc
is
both
aiming
to
shut
down
predictit
and
has
repeatedly
been
stopped
by
courts
including
the
second
highest
court
in
the
land
and
is
proposing
a
rule
that
would
ban
election
markets
in
the
united
states
perhaps
permanently
10
predictit
is
spearheading
an
effort
to
tell
the
cftc
why
these
markets
are
important
and
why
the
cftc
is
wrong
to
view
them
as
gambling
akin
to
sports
betting
or
a
spin
of
the
roulette
wheel
we
know
that
predictit
traders
invest
time
and
research
into
making
informed
opinions
about
some
of
the
most
economically
impactful
events
elections
of
their
lives
these
are
not
games
and
the
cftc
attempts
to
brand
them
as
gaming
are
wrong
we
need
your
help
to
submit
comments
and
force
the
cftc
to
rethink
this
proposal
please
cease
your
activities
against
and
similar
informational
sites
sincerely
