this

another

the

dozens

the

beginning

after

there
is

the

purpose
the
exchange
makes
the
following
points
as
well
1
elections
and
political
control
are
not
games
unlike
games
in
which
the
underlying
activity
has
no
inherent
economic
value
apart
from
the
money
wagered
on
it
political
control
has
an
obvious
and
large
economic
impact
as
it
heavily
influences
expectations
and
the
likelihood
of
public
policy
change
as
gregory
kuserk
noted
unlike
games
elections
are
events
that
are
very
important
to
the
public
and
there
is
a
very
strong
public
interest
in
having
accurate
data

elections
are
not
games
full
stop
indeed
the
nadex
order
did
not
identify
political
elections
themselves
the
core
of
american
democracy
as
being
a
game

trading
on
congressional
control
is
not
gaming
the
nadex
order
asserted
that
gaming
is
equivalent
to
placing
a
wager
or
bet
and
it
cited
a
federal
statute
that
defined
the
term
bet
or
wager
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
nadex
order
at
3
if
taking
a
position
on
a
congressional
control
contract
is
equivalent
to
a
wager
or
bet
because
it
places
money
on
an
event
outcome
that
would
imply
that
taking
a
position
in
any
event
contract
is
also
equivalent
to
a
wager
or
bet
some
commentators
appear
to
equate
speculation
with
gaming
and
do
not
sympathize
with
the
important
role
speculation
plays
in
price
discovery
and
risk
transfer
many
commodity
futures
markets
such
as
those
in
oil
often
feature
large
amounts
of
speculative
behavior
yet
clearly
do
not
constitute
gaming
contracts
this
is
not
true
in
law
while
gambling
is
illegal
in
many
states
and
interstate
betting
is
prohibited
event
contracts
are
legal
in
all
jurisdictions
as
former
commissioner
quintenz
wrote
gaming
describes
wagering
money
on
an
occurrence
that
has
no
inherent
economic
value
itself
other
than
the
money
wagered
on
its
outcome
for
instance
wagering
money
on
roulette
or
blackjack
should
be
considered
gaming
because
there
is
no
economic
significance
of
the
activity
apart
from
the
wager
itself
speculation
on
the
contrary
is
risking
value
where
the
underlying
activity
has
economic
consequences
which
then
means
the
speculative
activity
creates
valuable
societal
and
economic
benefit
from
a
price
discovery
and
risk
transfer
function
for
those
exposed
to
the
risk
of
that
underlying
activity
see
public
comment
on
kalshi
contracts
from
brian
quintenz
available
at
the
relevant
language
of
involve
relate
to
or
reference
comes
from
commission
regulation
13
this
language
can
not
be
broader
than
the
statutory
language
that
is
simply
involves
17
by
definition
if
the
regulation
applied
more
broadly
than
the
statute
it
would
per
se
violate
the
apa
and
be
invalid

2
what
role
does
the
requirement
that
the
contracts
trade
in
multiples
of
5000
the
position
limits
applicable
to
the
contracts
play
in
the
analysis
of
whether
the
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
are
the
position
limits
reasonably
enforceable
it
does
not
play
a
role
a
larger
order
size
will
likely
reduce
the
number
of
smaller
traders
and
trades
but
does
not
affect
the
contract
hedging
utility
the
position
limits
are
enforceable
kalshi
is
regulated
by
the
commission
who
can
monitor
such
behavior
other
exchanges
list
products
with
custom
order
sizes
notional
sizes
and
position
limits
as
well
there
is
no
reason
to
speculate
that
kalshi
will
somehow
not
be
able
to
enforce
this
indeed
the
division
is
well
aware
of
kalshi
ability
to
enforce
position
limits
additionally
it
is
not
clear
why
kalshi
ability
to
enforce
a
rule
is
appropriate
for
public
comment
how
is
a
member
of
the
public
supposed
to
have
information
on
kalshi
systems
and
procedures
and
internal
processes
for
compliance
it
would
seem
that
the
most
appropriate
party
to
address
this
question
to
is
kalshi
and
kalshi
notes
that
surprisingly
and
incongruously
the
commission
has
never
asked
kalshi
this
question
3
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
whether
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
1
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
no
the
commission
should
not
consider
this
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
gaming
and
subject
to
the
special
rule
for
event
contracts
for
four
reasons
1
presence
on
an
illegal
exchange
casino
or
sportsbook
does
not
by
right
cause
relation
to
gaming
for
example
if
corn
futures
become
widely
traded
in
casinos
and
sports
books
that
would
not
change
the
nature
of
the
corn
futures
contract
into
a
gaming
contract
the
converse
is
also
true
if
a
traditional
futures
exchange
started
a
roulette
parlor
the
bets
in
the
parlor
would
still
be
gaming
2
what
is
offered
at
such
venues
changes
over
time
for
example
if
we
used
this
nature
of
the
venue
determines
nature
of
the
product
standard
many
commodity
futures
and
securities
might
have
originally
been
considered
gaming
because
bucket
shops
traded
those
products
in
large
volumes
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
they
may
have
continued
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
bucket
shop
prohibitions
3
the
commission
prevented
congressional
control
contracts
from
being
listed
on
exchange
in
the
nadex
order
it
would
be
circular
to
use
the
fact
that
such
activity
has
persisted
off
exchange
as
evidence
the
activity
is
gaming
for
example
if
the
commission
prohibited
oil
futures
and
oil
futures
trading
moved
to
casinos
that
would
not
suddenly
change
the
economic
nature
of
oil
futures
4
the
commission
did
not
consider
the
venues
offering
for
example
bitcoin
contracts
prior
to
the
listing
of
bitcoin
contracts
on
dcms
if
the
commission
considered
this
inquiry
to
be
dispositive
that
something
is
gaming
those
contracts
would
be
gaming
contracts
because
of
their
large
presence
on
such
venues
however
even
if
the
commission
did
consider
venue
as
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
contracts
involve
gaming
congressional
control
is
not
offered
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
and
is
not
available
in
casinos
like

vegas

fivethirtyeight
2016
bets
on
the
control
of
congress
are
accepted
at
caesar
palace
or
the
bellagio
such
contracts
are
only
currently
offered
on
some
overseas
betting
services
and
illegal
or
unregulated
venues
in
the
united
states
instead
of
considering
venue
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
subject
of
the
contracts
involves
gaming
when
adjudicating
whether
a
contract
involves
gaming
per
kalshi
letter
on
the
special
rule
application
2
should
the
commission
consider
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
no
for
two
reasons
first
because
per
the
special
rule
only
the
underlying
event
congressional
control
should
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
contracts
involve
gaming
the
application
of
the
special
rule

this
question

available
at
taking

in

not

it

that

congress
has
repeatedly
recognized
that

therefore
state

that

laws
do
not
violate

and

all
of
this
shows
that
congress
and
the
states
understand
that
there
is
a
critical
distinction
between
betting
and
legitimate
federally
recognized
and
regulated
financial
activity
election
contracts
that
are
designed
for
price
formation
and
hedging
on
a
derivative
exchange
constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
give
consideration
of
the
definitions
under
state
and
federal
gambling
laws
as
these
laws
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to
contracts
like
kalshi
indeed
a
key
purpose
of
the
cea
and
granting
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over

was
to
authorize
and
promote
trading
of
futures
contracts
notwithstanding
state
laws
that
might
purport
to
prohibit
them
as
gambling
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
is
relevant
is
if
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
violates
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evasion
in
that
case
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
a
futures
contract
would
not
legitimize
that
activity
without
the
commission
considering
whether
trading
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
obviously
would
not
be
concerned
about
legitimizing
elections
even
if
the
focus
comes
to
legitimizing
the
trading
on
elections
as
part
of
the
ultimate
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
has
already
crossed
that
bridge
by
long
permitting
market
participants
to
trade
such
contracts
pursuant
to
no
action
letters
awarded
to
unregulated
markets
the
notion
that
allowing
a
regulated
exchange
to
offer
the
contracts
is
what
changes
the
public
interest
analysis
is
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
betting
the
wire
act
is
irrelevant
here
it
applies
only
to
sports
betting
and
wagering
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
addressed
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the
internet
it
carved
out
derivatives
contracts
both
on
exchange
and
over
the
counter
from
the
definition
of
betting
and
wagering
thereby
plainly
recognizing
that
derivatives
contracts
serve
economic
purposes
that
distinguish
them
from
gambling
gaming
the
unlawful
internet
gambling

act
of

not
include
any

conducted

taking
a
position
in
an
event
contract
is
not
equivalent
to
as
states
or
the
federal
government
may
define
it
wagering
or
betting
which
they
prohibit
this
is
not
true
legally
interstate
betting
is
illegal
and
betting
is
illegal
in

are
legal
in
all
jurisdictions

in

as
father

richard
sandor
wrote
in
his
comment
letter
a
major
misconception
that
still
prevails
among
the
public
is
the
equivalence
of
gambling
and
speculation
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
gambling
is
an
artificial
self
constructed
risk
created
for
recreation
speculation
is
the
assumption
of
risks
that
already
exist
in
the
real
and
financial
markets
the
recreational
risk
of
gambling
is
not
present
until
the
casino
or
racetrack
is
built
and
wagers
are
accepted
on
the
other
hand
risk
in
the
production
of
good
and
services
in
the
economy
are
real
and
will
exist
even
in
the
absence
of
futures
markets
the
same
can
be
said
for
equity
and
interest
rate
and
risk
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
the
risks
associated
with
policy
changes
from
different
election
outcomes
are
most
similar
to
the
latter
the
transfer
of
risk
by
hedgers
would
be
real
and
the
assumption
of
that
risk
by
speculators
would
be
proper
public
comment
by
richard
sandor
available
at
taking
a
position
in
an
event
contract
is
also
not
equivalent
to
the
unlawful
activity
such
laws
refer
to
because
such
laws
are
not
operative
on
cftc
regulated
products
federal
law
definitions
of
gaming
betting
wagering
carve
out
exemptions
for
cftc
regulated
products
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
not
include
any
transaction
conducted
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
registered
entity
or
exempt
board
of
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
31
2006
many
states
gaming
provisions
also
include
such
exemptions
for
example
washington
state
rcw
clarifies
that
cftc
regulated
transactions
are
not
affected
by
its
anti

provisions
states

provisions
are
preempted
explicitly
as
well
by
the
cfma
7
usc
covers
exclusive
cftc
jurisdiction
over
futures
and
swaps
so
any
state
laws
that
would
purport
to
regulate
or
prohibit
futures
or
swaps
would
be
preempted
the
cea
also
preempts

laws
with
respect
to

products
that
are

or

from

this
act
shall
supersede
and
preempt
the
application
of
any
state
or
local
law
that
prohibits
or
regulates
gaming
or
the
operation
of
bucket
shops
in
the
case
of
a
an
electronic
trading
facility
excluded
under
section
of
this
act
and
b
an
agreement
contract
or
transaction
that
is
excluded
from
this
act
under
provisions
of
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
or
exempted
under
section
of
this
act
even
derivatives
products
that
are
excluded
or
exempted
from
cftc
regulation
still
preempt
state
gaming
and
bucket
shop
laws
per
the
cfma
ibid
it
could
not
follow
more
plainly
that
cftc
regulated
derivatives
have
the
same
preemptive
effect
congress
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
futures
and
other
derivative
contracts
serve
economic
purposes
and
therefore
state
laws
that
purport
to
prohibit
or
regulate
futures
or
derivative
contracts
including
gaming
laws
do
not
violate
the
cea
and
are
preempted
all
of
this
shows
that
congress
and
the
states
understand
that
there
is
a
critical
distinction
between
betting
and
legitimate
financial
activity
election
contracts
that
are
designed
for
hedging
on
a
financial
market
constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
consider
the
contracts
as
involving
unlawful
activity
as
these
laws
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to
contracts
like
kalshi
a
key
purpose
of
the
cea
and
granting
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
futures
was
to
authorize
and
promote
trading
of
futures
contracts
notwithstanding
state
laws
that
might
purport
to
prohibit
them
as
gambling
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
is
relevant
is
if
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
violates
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evasion
in
that
case
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
a
futures
contract
would
not
legitimize
that
activity
without
the
commission
considering
whether
trading
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
obviously
would
not
be
concerned
about
legitimizing
elections
even
if
the
focus
comes
to
legitimizing
the
trading
on
elections
as
part
of
the
ultimate
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
has
already
crossed
that
bridge
by
long
permitting
market
participants
to
trade
such
contracts
pursuant
to
no
action
letters
awarded
to
unregulated
markets
the
notion
that
allowing
a
regulated
exchange
to
offer
the
contracts
is
what
changes
the
public
interest
analysis
is
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
betting
the
wire
act
is
irrelevant
here
it
applies
only
to
sports
betting
and
wagering
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
addressed
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the
internet
it
carved
out
derivatives
contracts
both
on
exchange
and
over
the
counter
from
the
definition
of
betting
and
wagering
thereby
plainly
recognizing
that
derivatives
contracts
serve
economic
purposes
that
distinguish
them
from
gambling
gaming
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
not
include
any
transaction
conducted
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
registered
entity
or
exempt
board
of
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
31
2006
congress
recognized
this
much
earlier
too

the
cftc

and

be

the

the
theory
that
there
are
state
laws

a
federal
law
prohibiting
gambling
wagering
on

and
that
wagering
is
equivalent
to
taking
a
position
on
an

that
would
mean
that
the
special

is
triggered
by
any

contract
because
many
state

laws
prohibit
wagering
on
the
outcome
of
any
future
event
that
interpretation
was
clearly
not
congress
intent
instead
congress
narrowly
defined
a
small
number
of
event
contracts
whose
underlying
event
involves
an
unsavory
activity
that
congress
did
not
want
the
cftc
to
legitimize
without
evaluating
whether
trading
a
contract
on
that
activity
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
per
the
text
which
isolates
a
selected
set
of
enumerated
events
to
target
time
and
time
again
congress
and
states
have
indicated
that
the
commission
has
the
decision
making
power
here
and
approval
of
kalshi
contract
has
no
involvement
with
unlawful
activity
any
more
than
an
event
contract
on
gross
domestic

or
whether
a

becomes
law
if
the
commission
chooses
to
isolate
these
contracts
as
involving

not
those
many
others
it
would
be
acting

in

while

not

alone
to
determine
the

it
is
undeniably
an
important
factor
that
the

should
consider
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
that
interest
it
is
unlikely
that
the

would
disagree
that
its
many
core
principles

lead

accordingly
there
is
significant
public
interest
in
having
these

available
on
regulated

similarly
especially
with
regard
to
congressional

it
is
important
that

not
be

there
are

a
tall

resources
the
breadth
of
these

and
the

accordingly
these

will
likely
continue
to
exist
the
question
is
whether
they
will
exist
also
in
a
regulated
market
or
remain
just
in
the
unregulated
shadow
market
this
is
of
course
not
a
reason
to
permit
the
contracts
independently
of
the
contract
economic
utility
but
it
is
an
undeniably
important
public
interest
consideration
because
the
breadth
of
the
current

is
a
more
recent
development
this
public

was

can
be

an

however
the

that

in

need
this
product
fills
1
should
the
commission
review
a
contract
hedging
function
there
is
no
requirement
from
congress
nor
mechanism
by
which
the
commission
can
or
should
determine
hedging
utility
as
a
metric
on
its
own
outside
of
the
public
interest
however
a
contract
hedging
utility
can
be
considered
as
supporting
the
public
interest
as
part
of
the
public

consideration
should
the

find
that
a
contract
involves
one
of
the

activities
of
the
special

2
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
theoretical
use
or
demonstrated
need
a
contract
hedging
utility
may
be
an
important
consideration
in
favor
of
finding
that
a
contract
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
the
commission
find
that
it
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
of
the
special
rule
hedging
is
in
the
public
interest
and
promoting
risk
mitigation
is
a
core
mission
of
the
cftc
the
exchange
notes
however
that
these
two
suggestions
theoretical
versus
demonstrated
need
are
more
like
opposite
ends
of
a
spectrum
and
there
are
variations
in
between
it
should
use
a
theoretical
use
standard
a
demonstrated
need
standard
could
inhibit
the
creation
of
new
products
with
smaller
or
less
clear
markets
has
no
clear
mechanism
by
which
it
can
be
determined
and
because
a
contract
only
theoretically
being
used
for
hedging
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
should
not
be
missed
that
the
standard
implied
in
the
last
part
of
this
question
some
minimum
required
amount
of
hedging
in
absolute
or
percentage
terms
would
be
likely
to
have
unintended
consequences
if
imposed
on
the
market
1
this
standard
has
not
been
imposed
on
any
other
contract
in
commission
history
including
any
event
contract
there
are
only
90
million
barrels
of
oil
produced
per
day
but
almost
1
billion

are

clearly
added
value
to
the
global
financial
system
2
the
percentage
of
the
contract
participants
hedging
will
no
doubt
vary
over
time
in
a
vibrant
dynamic
marketplace
as
risks
change
3
speculation
is
an
accepted
important
use
case
for
all
contracts
in
the
financial
markets
speculation
on
events
of
economic
purpose
is
not
equivalent
to
gaming
or
gambling
and
has
never
been
considered
that
non
hedgers
help
balance
out
any
differences
between
short
and
long
hedgers
and
provide
liquidity
to
the
hedgers
themselves
without
speculation
none
of
the
major
futures
and
derivatives
markets
would
be
as
liquid
as
they
are
today
and
thus
as
powerful
in
fulfilling
the
hedging
utility
as
they
are
speculation
improves
a
contract
hedging
utility
even
in
cases
where
the
non
hedgers
are
not
actually
matching
on
the
exchange
with
the
hedgers
they
are
providing
a
valuable
service
to
the
hedgers
the
price
offered
on
an
exchange
is
a
function
of
many
factors
including
demand
and
liquidity
non
hedgers
will
demand
a
greater
premium
if
they
know
it
will
be
harder
for
them
to
exit
their
positions
later
if
their
needs
change
so
the
presence
of
later
non
hedgers
willing
to
provide
liquidity
and
trading
volume
is
essential
to
encouraging
the
original
round
of
liquidity
providers
to
offer
more
competitive
prices
to
the
hedgers
since
the
original
liquidity
providers
know
that
they
will
not
have
an
issue
exiting
their
positions
later
as
commissioner
quintenz
put
it
whereas
bettors
participate
in
games
of
pure
chance
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
completely
reward
the
winner
and
punish
the
loser
for
an
outcome
that
would
otherwise
provide
no
economic
utility
think

speculators
in
the
derivatives
market
participate
in
non
chance
driven
outcomes
that
have
price
forming
impacts
upon
which
legitimate
businesses
can
hedge
their
activities
and
cash
flows
the
other
factor
which
makes
speculation
different
than
pure
chance
gambling
is
the
price
forming
impact
it
has
on
markets
which
allow

to
hedge
their

are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
the
commission
question
can
be
taken
to
imply
two
different
things
either
that
the
other
products
are
linked
directly
on
the
same
risks
that
the
contracts
would
be
used
for
hedging
or
that
market
participants
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedging
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instruments
assuming
the
former
the
answer
is
yes
there
are
risks
that
can
not
be
currently
hedged
first
as
noted
by
hehmeyer
and
other
commenters
and
in
the
exchange
submission
there
are
significant
direct
non
policy
related
economic
risks
such
as
the
risks
imposed
by
political
outcomes
on
the
fortunes
of
media
personalities
media
consultants
and
others
with
connections
and
ties
to
the
party
in
power
these
risks
can
not
be
otherwise
hedged
by
traditional
products
as
discussed
earlier
changes
in
general
risk
that
a
certain
congress
could
pose
to
various
industries
can
be
discerned
well
in
advance
of
knowledge
of
the
particular
policies
that
may
be
implemented
by
that
congress
and
provide
just
as
valid
a
hedging
rationale
this
difference
results
from
the
time
horizon
between
the
election
cycle
and
the
implementation
of
a
new
congress
specific
legislative
agenda
or
its
potential
responses
to
current
events
for
example
following
the
election
of
republicans
into
congress
in
2016
many
publications
speculated
that
trade
policy
would
become
more
restrictive
however
it
was
not
known
if
this
would
come
in
the
form
of
new
trade
deals
re
negotiating
existing
trade
agreements
new
tarrifs
and
if
so
on
what
goods
and
at
what
level
international
lawsuits
and
more
another
event
contract
or
future
on
taxes
or
public
policy
would
not
have
been
very
helpful
however
the
risk
of
a
more
restrictive
policy
was
there
because
of
who
would
win
the
election
exactly
what
kalshi
contracts
allow
traders
to
hedge
another
example
is
new
legislation
that
would
burden
a
market
participant
once
the
legislation
draft
is
released
the
impact
will
begin
to
be
felt
immediately
on
assets
cash
flows
and
partnerships
as
market
participants
price
in
risk
making
a
hedge
useless
the
downside
risk
has
already
had
much
of
its
effect
markets
are
forward
looking
and
hedging
products
should
reflect
that
even
just
a
statement
by
a
politician
can
be
very
damaging

additionally
a
single
market
participant
may
face
myriad
risks
from
elections
many
firms
and
individuals
are
negatively
affected
by
a
suite
of
a
party
policies
and
thus
wish
to
hedge
the
many
different
changes
in
risk
through
a
single
contract
for
example
an
oil
company
may
wish
to
hedge
the
risk
that
a
new
democratic
government
will
come
into
office
because
that
government
could
not
only
impose
new
regulations
on
them
but
also
change
the
composition
of
existing
regulatory
bodies
and
increase
their
labor
costs
through
raising
the
minimum
wage
supporting
unionization
or
mandating
greater
health
care
benefits
for
employees
only
kalshi
proposal
lets
them
hedge
the
risk
they
actually
face
democratic
government
if
the
question
is
asking
instead
whether
market
participants
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedging
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instruments
the
answer
is
they
can
not
many
retail
and
small
business
market
participants
do
not
have
access
to
these
other
instruments
and
the
inherent
friction
and
transaction
costs
in
arranging
these
types
of
complex
proxy
plays
is
prohibitive
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
commission
would
determine
it
in
the
public
interest
to
solely
rely
on
these
tools
that
are
inaccessible
to
many
of
the
market
participants
who
need
risk
management
tools
most
additionally
the
effectiveness
of
these
baskets
and
combination
of
instruments
to
hedge
the
risk
from
political
control
is
considerably
less
than
a
contract
directly
on
political
control
importantly
the
question
implies
that
its
answer
matters
but
does
not
explain
why
it
would
a
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
commission
is
saying
no
new
method
of
hedging
a
risk
should
be
permitted
if
there
are
other
existing
methods
of
hedging
that
risk
nowhere
in
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulations
is
there
such
a
standard
the
exchange
hopes
this
is
not
the
commission
view
as
it
has
not
been
the
exchange
experience
when
engaging
with
the
commission
on
prior
contracts
for
example
should
the
commission
say
farmers
can
buy
crop
insurance
therefore
they
should
not
have
access
to
agricultural
futures
products
furthermore
such
an
interpretation
would
be
highly
anti
competitive
such
an
interpretation
would
mean
that
if
one
firm
offers
a
contract
on
an
event
or
a
commodity
that
no
challenger
should
enter
the
market
with
a
similar
but
different
product
to
compete
with
it
in
fact
such
an
interpretation
would
consistently
punish
novel
or
innovative
products
in
many
cases
it
is
possible
to
construct
a
hedge
using
existing
products
and
attempting
to
do
so
might
be
expensive
or
incur
excess
basis
risk
the
fact
that
election
risk
has
implications
for
other
assets
is
in
fact
much
of
the
justification
for
the
contract
hedging
utility
and
would
work
in
concert
with
such
assets
many
similar
and
competing
products
are
listed
by
different
exchanges
in
order
to
promote
a
vibrant
and
competitive
marketplace
for
hedgers
this
is
also
an
important
component
of
the
contract
price
discovery
utility
discussed
in
a
later
question
such
an
interpretation
would
also
curtail
innovation
innovation
often
happens
through
iterating
on
already
successful
products
and
ideas
as
in
the
earlier
example
the
existence
of
insurance
products
would
have
inhibited
the
creation
of
futures
innovation
often
requires
creating
new
and
sometimes
flawed
products
in
order
to
try
and
optimize
use
cases
for
market
participants
hedgers
benefit
when
many
exchanges
are
launching
many
different
products
to
try
and
tailor
to
their
needs
they
suffer
when
the
government
limits
their
options
it
in
the
public
interest
for
such
innovation
to
occur
and
for
that
to
happen
the
commission
should
not
take
the
view
that
this
product
should
not
be
listed
because
it
purportedly
can
be
hedged
through
other
means

in
the
more
immediate
political
future
the
hedging
benefits
are
obvious
since
i
no
longer
employed
through
my
union
my
wife
no
longer
has
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seems
that
republicans
are
likely
to
take
control
i
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premiums
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
smaller
or
that
her
ability
to
purchase
insurance
at
all
is
taken
away

that
many
are
affected
regardless
of

for

media
personalities
and
companies
face
risk
from
congressional

and
elections
early
professionals
hoping
to
work
on
capitol
hill
know
there
are
far
more
positions
available
if
their
preferred

is
victorious
as
there
are
more
congressional
offices

committee
positions
for
them
to
staff
a
consultancy
that
specializes
in
specific
topic
areas
for
example
a
green
energy
consultancy
may
know
the
demand
for
their
services
will
decline
in
anticipation
that
their
issue
of
expertise
is
less
likely
to
be
operative
under
a
split
congress
these
risks
occur
regardless
of
the

that

passes
there
are
billions
of
dollars
at

surrounding

public
comment
by
christopher
hehmeyer
available
at
although
some
commenters
claimed
election
outcomes
are
predictable
enough
to
be
a
useful
hedge
that
in
no
way
contradicts
or
even
diminishes
those
who
say
the
opposite
at
most
those
commenters
do
see
hedging
utility
for
themselves
but
they
can
not
credibly
say
especially
given
the
comment
file
that
all
the
people
who
identify
how
they
would
use
the
contracts
for
hedging
and
managing
their
risk
are
mistaken
or
deficient
in
their
ability
to
recognize
risk
and
potential
tools
to
manage
or
mitigate
that
risk
it
would
be
arbitrary
for
the
commission
to
listen
only
to
those
who
assert
that
there
is
no
hedging
use
case
for
anyone
when
there
are
many
others
who
state
that
they
would
use
the
product
for
themselves
or
their
business
as
noted
by
hehmeyer
there
is
sufficient
impact
from
elections
themselves
independent
of
the
policy
implications
of
political
control
to
not
only
justify
these
markets
economic
utility
but
to
make
them
valuable
in
addition
markets
already
believe
that
the
policy
implications
of
elections
themselves
are
sufficiently
meaningful
so
as
to
be
worth
repricing
assets
suggesting
that
they
are
predictable
enough
elections
have
vast
consequences
which
directly
impact
the
likelihood
of
events
happening
or
not
happening
such
as
a
bill
being
passed
while
it
is
true
that
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
the
precise
implementation
of
any
given
law
by
a
new
congress
what
exactly
would
the
size
of
the
stimulus
checks
be
what
exactly
would
the
new
tax
rate
be
changes
in
probabilities
are
more
than
sufficient
for
hedging
purposes
in
addition
once
the
specifics
of
a
policy
risk
have
been
announced
like
the
text
of
a
bill
it
practically
impossible
to
hedge
because
of
the
high
cost
now
that
the
probability
of
the
event
has
increased
it
important
for
a
potential
hedger
to
hedge
in
advance
of
the
specifics
of
their
risks
being
announced
changes
in
general
risk
also
can
provide
a
strong
hedging
need
as
opposed
to
the
changes
in
risk
of
a
specific
outcome
if
one
party
is
in
complete
control
of
congress
there
is
likely
to
be
a
change
in
general
risk
on
carbon
based
energy
products
and
industries
and
an
opposite
change
in
general
risk
on
renewable
energy
products
and
industries
while
the
specific
policies
implemented
may
be
hard
to
know
in
advance
that
change
in
general
risk
has
been
discussed
at
length
in
comment
letters
and
is
hedged
extensively
by
larger
institutions
through
complex
products
public
comment

available

consider
a
concrete
example
of
probabilistic
change
from
the
bond
markets
ten
percent
of
the
catastrophe
bond
market
is
in
parametric
triggers
which
means
the
bond
pays
out
if
certain
meteorological
triggers
are
met
the
bond
issuer
does
not
know
for
certain
whether
the
storm
that
meets
the
threshold
will
cause
mass
flooding
power
outages
and
property
damage
and
conversely
it
possible
that
such
damages
could
occur
with
a
storm
that
does
not
meet
the
trigger
thresholds
yet
they
use
the
bond
to
hedge
nonetheless
because
other
features
of
the
bond
hedging
wind
speed
namely
are
more
important
to
them
than
eliminating
basis
risk
moreover
even
if
a
wheat
farmer
buys
a
contract
that
pays
out
if
the
price
of
wheat
falls
below
a
certain
threshold
there
is
still
some
uncertainty
as
to
whether
that
event
will
harm
them
it
possible
that
a
wheat
falls
below
a
certain
threshold
because
weather
conditions
are
so
great
that
there
was
a
bumper
crop
and
that
the
increase
in
their
supply
offset
the
loss
in
price
or
b
that
the
national
price
does
not
perfectly
correlate
with
the
local
price
they
received
but
they
can
use
the
product
nevertheless

it

the
only
consideration
hedging
is
in
the

and
promoting

mitigation
is
a
core
mission
of
the

and
kalshi
in
addition
whatever
standard
the
commission
uses
kalshi
contracts
are
permissible
as
evidenced
by
the
public
comments
the
intended
customer
base
is
a
mixture
of
hedgers
liquidity
providers
market
makers
forecasters
and
speculators
this
is
consistent
with
the
customer
base
of
some
of
the
world
largest
commodity
markets
and
is
thus
wholly
permissible
the
commission
would
be
speculating
to
suggest
otherwise
given
the
large
body
of
relevant
evidence

analysis
should
it

however
it
should
not
consider
an

this
would
be
very
speculative
customer
bases
change
over
time
in
many
cases
an
exchange
may
use
a
product
in
order
to
attract
a
new
customer
base
so
using
past
customers
as
the
foundation
for
guessing
what
the
intended
customer
base
is
would
be
erroneous
if
anything
this
test
would
inappropriately
penalize
any
novel
product
as
those
are
the
products
most
likely
to
have
an
intended
customer
base
most
different
from
the
existing
user
base
in
short
there
is
no
basis
in
law
for
the
commission
to
speculate
about
whether
an
exchange
intended
customer
base
meets
its
standards
trade
requirement
sizes
are
also
not
relevant
it
may
affect
the
number
of
parties
who
use
the
contract
for
what
purpose
and
in
what
capacity
but
nonetheless
the
contract
can
not
serve
less
of
a
hedging
function
because
of
the
proposed
trade
size
which
is
neither
exceptionally
small
nor
large

2
does
the
requirement
that
all
contracts
listed
on
kalshi
must
be
fully
collateralized
affect
this
analysis
whether
a
contract
is
fully
collateralized
or
margined
should
not
influence
the
commission
thinking
further
in
this
case
it
would
be
irrelevant
the
hedging
use
cases
shown
by
the
public
comments
and
other
evidence
provided
to
the
commission
by
kalshi
show
that
there
is
no
basis
to
conclude
that
full
collateralization
will
deter
or
preclude
hedging
behavior
individuals
small
businesses
and
medium
sized
businesses
are
all
interested
in
using
the
contracts
as
they
stand
and
as
kalshi
proposed
accordingly
even
if
the
commission
considered
the
full
collateralization
requirement
it
would
still
easily
pass
the
test
there
is
one
area
where
the
full
collateralization
requirement
becomes
relevant
and
that
is
in
regard
to
responsible
innovation
as
a
foray
into
quasi
new
territory
it
makes
sense
that
the
exchange
has
certified
only
a
fully
collateralized
product
this
requirement
will
prevent
excessive
leveraging
and
while
it
certainly
may
be
appropriate
to
have
margin
products
on
this
in
the
future
as
an
initial
product
it
is
prudent
and
sensible
to
maintain
kalshi
requirement
that
the
contract
be
fully
collateralized
indeed
kalshi
should
be
commended
for
its
cautious
approach
to
innovation
3
does
the
requirement
that
these

should

when
trying
to
assess
the
economic

of
the

as
noted
in
previous
responses
outside
of
the
public
interest
test
there
is
no
required
hedging
test
of
the
contract
nor
one
provided
by
congress
the
rules
or
the
regulations
hedging
may
be
an
important
consideration
as

of
a

public

test
should
the
commission
find
that
it
involves
one
of
the

though
it
need
not
be
its
only
consideration
as

of
that
test
hedging
is
in
the
public
interest
and
promoting
risk
mitigation
is
a
core
mission
of
the
cftc
in
addition
as
argued
above
the
commission
should
not
speculate
about
the
exact
amount
or
percentage
of
total
trading
that
will
be
used
to
hedge
instead
it
should
consider
whether
there
are
hedging
use
cases
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
the
contracts
to
be
utilized
for
hedging
as
often
as
the
market
sees
fit
to
hedge
many
contracts
listed
by
other
exchanges
are
traded
very
little
at
all
in
fact
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
the
market
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
contract
design
is
appropriate
for
hedging
not
the
commission
if
the
contract
design
is
a
poor
fit
for
hedging
needs
which
it
does
not
appear
to
be
especially
given
the
many
public
comments
by
retail
small
businesses
and
industry
in
support
then
kalshi
will
attract
fewer
participants
and
in
the
future
will
amend
the
contract
structure
to
improve
the
incentives
of
the
exchange
and
hedgers
are
aligned
substituting
the
commission
judgment
for
the
market
would
short
circuit
that
valuable
process
accordingly
the
commission
inquiry
into
hedging
as
part
of
its
public
interest
inquiry
should
be
whether
the
contracts
can
be
used
for
hedging
as
noted
however
the
contracts
here
have
significant
hedging
utility
that
would
pass
any
of
these
tests
moreover
different
firms
have
different
hedging
needs
and
different
structures
can
best
meet
those
needs
what
works
for
one
firm
may
not
work
best
for
another
firm
as
a
result
the
commission
should
not
attempt
to
speculate
about
whether
a
particular
structure
would
work
as
they
may
miss
many
firms
for
whom
an
alternative
structure
is
better
the
utility
of
the
market
is
that
there
exists
a
profit
incentive
to
create
products
for
even
niche
groups
of
buyers
and
insofar
as
private
firms
are
far
closer
to
their
potential
customer
base
than
a
government
agency
which
does
not
interact
with
them
on
a
daily
basis
unlike
an
exchange
it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
for
the
commission
to
impose
its
judgment
about
whether
a
product
structure
meets
potential
customer
needs
it
in
the
public
interest
to
permit
innovative
contracts
that

congressional

in

either
the

there
is
a

perhaps
the

might
argue
that
while
congressional
control
is
binary
the
effects
of

some
people
like
energy
firms
might
be
affected
a
lot
whereas
other
people
like
an

might

relatively
less
then
there
exists
a
continuum
between
the
energy
firm
and
the
it
consultant
of
people
affected
however
it
does
not
follow
that
binary

can
not
be
a
suitable
tool
for

since
the

are
still

this
includes

check
against

a

based
price
created
by
the

can
aid
information
aggregation
for
the
public
for
the
numerically
inclined
or
the
financially
minded
a
viewer
can
see
that
one
commentator
is
asserting
that
candidate
x
is
a

thing
but
the
kalshi

gives
them
only
a

chance

they
now
have
a
competing
alternative
to
that
pundit
information
markets
tend
to
be
more
accurate
than
any
pundit
or
forecasting
alternatives
the
efficient
price
discovering

is
a
well

finding
in

the

weather

markets

reproducibility
of

are
better
at
discovering
which
papers
will
reproduce
than
experts
who
do
no
better
than

most
importantly
research
studying
iem
and
predictit
have
confirmed
that
markets
provide
more
accurate
information
than
traditional
forecasting
methods
kalshi
contracts
would
provide
a
visible
well
trusted
benchmark
against
which
to
evaluate
a
pundit
predictive
power
as
professor
tetlock
observed
prudent
consumers
should
become
suspicious
when
they
confront
a
public

of
poor

relative
to
the

in
tetlock
words
unadjusted
ex

forecasting
performance
tells

instead
it

not

it

people
could
just
point

many

deeply
dependent

entire

favored
by
a

almost
every

elections
already
have
billions
in
consequences
for
retail
small

dwarfing
the
value
of
any

and
yet
attempts
at
manipulation
are
unlikely
and
successful
manipulation
even
more
so
thanks
to
the
large
decentralized
nature
of
elections
strong
political
norms
and
laws
protecting
the
vote
these
contracts
do
not
change
much
less
materially
change
the
fact
that
individuals
already
have
large
stakes
in
election
outcomes
the
only
groups
that
can
directly
affect
the

are
extremely
unlikely
to

of

merely

a

way
their

are
heavily

and
kalshi

members

also
have
a
sworn
duty
to

electoral
processes
for
private
gain
other
related
officials

officials
vote
counters
also
take
such
oaths

are
heavily
monitored

of
the
strong

however
if

threats
it
is

to

further
cross

these
checks
help
to
further
reduce
the
potential
for

violations
and
further
increase
the
integrity
of

the

would
promote
the

in

accurate
and

studies
consistently
show
that
polarization
and
partisanship
has
increased
dramatically
in

last
few
decades
every
year
greater
numbers
of
people
say
they
believe

from

opposite

are
immoral
and
express
other
hostile
sentiments
more
concerning
than
mere
hostility
is
how
partisan
antipathy
can
create
alternative
sets
of

voters
from
different

simply
believe
two
sets
of
facts
about
the

it
is
from
this
miasma
where
conspiracy
theories
about

emerge
that

if
they
were
given
a
lesser
financial
prize

versus
none
for

and
a
greater
amount
for
getting
it
correct
the
gap
shrunk
by
about
80
percent
the
reasoning
roughly
tracks
as
follows
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
conflate
their
beliefs
as
preferences
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
is
definitely
going
to
win
the
2024
presidential
elections
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenged
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odds
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
express
beliefs
as
mere
signaling
lending
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
is
at
stake
they
are
able
to
differentiate
their
beliefs
from
their
preferences
in
other
words
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrinks
and
individuals
who
trade
on
election
markets
become
more
attune
to
facts
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
in
conclusion
the
contracts
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
it
strongly
supports
the
public
interest
as
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
above
the
contracts
will
improve
asset
pricing
provide
risk
management
opportunities
enhance
election
integrity
and
trust
and
shift
trading
activity
to
regulated
exchanges

1
the

will
not
harm

integrity
or
the
perception
of

it
is
important
for
the
commission
to
engage
with
the
evidence
on
election
integrity
rather
than
speculate
the
nadex
order
suggestion
that
voters
could
be
incentivized
to
switch
their
votes
and
thus
harm
election
integrity
was
outright
speculative
in
2012
and
has
since
been
disproven
by
predictit
success
without
any
claim
of
let
alone
proof
of
election
impropriety
driven
by
those
markets
today
election

what

and
for
that
brief
period
whenever
blowhard
partisans
insisted
that
some
outcome
was
going
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on
the
event
and
ask
them
why
they
thought
that

was
wrong
and
whether
they

even

thanks
to
the
large
decentralized
nature
of

strong
political
norms

these

do
not

the

that

has
grossly
misaligned
incentives
when
it
comes
to
reporting
on

chances
these
misinformed
incentives
tend
to
come
from
three
sources
first
pundits
may
want
to
hype
up
a
preferred
candidate
chances
in
order
to
flatter
the
sensibilities
of
their
audience
second
pundits
may
want
to
directly
contradict
a
so
called
mainstream
line
about
a
candidate
winning
in
order
to
gin
up
controversy
and
draw
more
clicks
or
viewership
as
a
result
they
may
claim
an
underdog
is
actually
the
true
favorite
and
to
further
court
controversy
and
viewership
claim
that
evidence
to
the
contrary
is
a
function
of
fraud
and
deception
third
even
when
pundits
attempt
to
be
honest
viewers
themselves
may
seek
out
information
that
confirms
their
own
biases
thus
rewarding
a
subset
of
relatively
dishonest
commentators
with
greater
advertising
revenue
from
the
increased
viewership
or
readership
in

we
have
empirical
evidence
of
the
dismal
performance
of

can
transparent

this

by
providing
an

against
the
ability

to

when
in

they
are

the

give
them

they
now

most

only

indeed
we
would
contend
that
the
benefit
of
election

on
reducing

large
decreasing
partisanship
studies
consistently
show
that
polarization
and
partisanship
has
increased
dramatically
in
the
last
few
decades
every
year
greater
numbers
of
people
say
they
believe
people
from
the
opposite

are
immoral
and
express
other
hostile
sentiments
more
concerning
than
mere
hostility
is
how
partisan
antipathy
can
create
alternative

voters
from
different

simply
believe
two

about

it

if

about

if
they
were
given
a
lesser
financial
prize
for
answering
unsure
versus
none
for
being
wrong
and
a
greater
amount
for
getting
it
correct
the
gap
shrunk
by
about
80
percent
the
reasoning
roughly
tracks
as
follows
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
conflate
their
beliefs
as
preferences
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
is
definitely
going
to
win
the
2024
presidential
elections
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenged
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odds
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
express
beliefs
as
mere
signaling
lending
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
is
at
stake
they
are
able
to
differentiate
their
beliefs
from
their
preferences
in
other
words
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrinks
and
individuals
who
trade
on
election
markets
become
more
attune
to
facts
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
empowering
researchers
and
policymakers
one
of
the
most
exciting
applications
of
election
event
contracts
is
their
ability
to
provide
powerful
new
causal
inference
tools
to
researchers
and
policymakers
right
now
estimating
the
effect
of
elections
is
rather
difficult
one
can
not
merely
compare
economic
outcomes
during
one
presidential
administration
versus
another
because
the
underlying
conditions
have
dramatically
changed
likewise
comparing
forward
looking
financial
indicators
before
and
after
election
day
runs
into
several
problems
including
that
many
markets
are
closed
overnight
and
that
the
market
has
already
priced
in
some
probability
of
the
eventual
victor
winning
enter
political
control
contracts
if
party
x
has
a
80
percent
chance
of
winning
and
then
when
they
actually
win
on
election
night
a
stock
goes
up
1
we
can
say
that
the
total
effect
of
the
election
was
5
percentage
point
if
going
from
80
to
100
is
1
then
going
from
0
to
100
is
roughly
5
but
it
can
get
even
stronger
since
researchers
would
now
have
a
time
series
of
how
the
probabilities
change
over
time
they
can
use
other
events
like
debates
prominent
speeches
and
the
revelation
of
major
scandals
to
regress
forward
looking
financial
variables
on
election
outcomes
in
a
way
impossible
without
prediction
markets
these
tools
are
far
from
hypotheticals
economists
justin
wolfers
and
eric
zitzewitz
have
already
conducted
several
studies
that
used
previous
prediction
markets
like
the
iowa
electronic
exchange
to
discern
the
effects
of
political
outcomes
on
economic
variables

however
the
lack
of
liquidity
on
their
underlying
markets
makes
their
studies
relatively
under
powered
having
a
transparent
regulated
exchange
with
greater
liquidity
could
dramatically
expand
the
universe
of
questions
researchers
could
answer
with
this
data
beyond
researchers
a
transparent
regulated
exchange
would
create
a
large
incentive
for
traders
to
develop
sophisticated
and
accurate
models
about
election
outcomes
in
order
to
gain
an
edge
the
2016
and
2020
elections
were
famous
for
the
failure
of
most
published
models
often
attributed
to
systematic
non
response
bias
in
polls
a
liquid
prediction
market
would
create
an
incentive
for
trading
firms
to
develop
solutions
to
these
hard
issues
in
order
to
make
more
money
fortunately
there
are
substantial
positive
externalities
to
these
investments
learning
how
better
to
model
poll
and
understand
the
population
would
help
policymakers
better
understand
their
constituents
so
they
can
figure
out
what
they
actually
want
voting
is
a
noisy
signal
of
preferences
the
financial
incentive
to
create
models
to
discern
voter
intentions
could
thus
make
our
democracy
even
more
responsive
the
demand
for
accurate
information
surrounding

is
enormous
and

in

the

initially
moved

these

were

undone
and

we

successfully
manipulate

a

have
indeed
hanson
and
oprea
found
one
major
reason
why
political
contracts
are
resistant
to
manipulation
attempts
is
that
any
attempt
to
manipulate
prices
induces
informed
counter
parties
to
enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
in
fact
the
greater
the
attempts
to
jack
up
one
side
prices
the
greater
the
returns
to
becoming
an
informed
trader
as
university
of
michigan
economist
justin
wolfers
and
dartmouth
economist
eric
zitzewitz
wrote
regarding
previous
political
contracts
none
of
these
attempts
at
manipulation
had
a
discernible
effect
on
prices
except
during
a
short
transition
phase
this
finding
was
also
noted
by

by

could
the
contracts
facilitate
violations
of
or
otherwise
undermine
federal
campaign
finance
laws
or
regulations
for
example
could
the
contracts
make
it
easier
to
sidestep
prohibitions
governing
coordination
between
candidate
campaign
committees
and
political
action
committees
no
the
concerns
this
question
raises
are
completely
unrelated
to
the
contract
function
or
impact
it
would
not
improve
or
impact
at
all
the
ability
of
pacs
and
campaigns
to
coordinate
if
the
implication
is
that
they
could
do
so
more
easily
by
providing
an
accurate
picture
of
the
state
of
the
race
then
public
polling
would
also
help
such
parties
sidestep
federal
law
a
plainly
untenable
proposition
as
described
earlier
it
is
not
plausible
for
any
actor
to
try
and
create
momentum
for
their
party
by
buying
up
one
side
shares
one
may
also
imagine
that
a
coordinated
group
of
individuals
may
conspire
to
manipulate
market
prices
to
give
the
false
impression
of
candidate
momentum
thus
potentially
harming
the
democratic
process
this
concern
has
been
tested
several
times
by
researchers
with
all
attempts
failing
koleman
and
strumpf
in
a
later
paper
examined
previous
american
political

found
that
no

were
capable
of
sustaining
anything
more
than
fleeting

they
wrote

find

do
the

present
any
special
considerations
with
respect
to
susceptibility
to
manipulation
or
surveillance
requirements
as
discussed
at
length
in
other
parts
of
this
letter
kalshi

not
readily
susceptible

and
is
outright
less
susceptible
than

kalshi

in
extensive
market
surveillance
and
employs
know
your
customer
authorization
to
prevent

in
compliance
with
the
core
principles
accordingly
we
believe
the
contemplated
measures
combined
with
kalshi
robust
market
surveillance
program
and
dedicated
technology
are
appropriately
calibrated
to
address
the
particular
risks
associated
with
these
particular
contracts
kalshi
rules
also
prohibit
trading
on
non
public
material
information
as
with
other
contracts
that
deal
with
publicly
important
information
such
as
on
the
monetary
policy
decisions
of
the
federal

the
integrity
of
the

by
the
federal
open

has
not
been
eroded
despite

that
trade
enormous
volumes
on

this
is
no
different
for
these
contracts
kalshi
employs
know
your
customer
authorization
and
would
prevent

by
politically
exposed
persons
including
campaigns
and
pacs
as
well
as

it
also

a
long

of
political

prohibited
from

regarding

advantages
of

and
private
polling
a
privately
commissioned
poll
is
not
materially
non
public
information
any
market
actor
can
employ
similar
research
strategies
in
many
other
markets
every

has
a
discrepancy

its

entire

as
then
commissioner

explained
the
goal
of
financial

is
not
to
protect

the
less

rather
the

incentivizes
being

in

accurate
pricing
for
the

the
benefits
of
which
are
discussed
in
detail
in
the
questions
regarding
public
interest
further
there
are
robust
protections
against
manipulation
the
exchange
has
rules
that
prohibit
manipulative
trading
and
the
exchange
performs
surveillance
to
detect
manipulation
this
serves
as
a
deterrent
to
attempts
to
manipulate
the
market
via
manipulative
trading
in
addition
the
exchange
rules
also
prohibit
trading
on
non
public
information
and
the
exchange
performs
surveillance
to
detect
violations
of
this
rule
the

is
also
adopting

gating

that

with
the

in

the

will
be
surveilling
its

for
any
sign

the

all
of

as

at

earlier
in
this

and
in

filing
american
elections
are
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
in
fact
manipulation
of
which
party
controls
the
congress
has
never
occurred
this
is
in
contrast
to
existing
markets
that
the
cftc
regulates
indeed
the
cftc
has
brought
numerous
enforcement
actions
against
market
participants
who
either
manipulated
or
attempted
to
manipulate
markets
in
oil
precious
metals
cattle
and
other
commodity
spot
and
futures
markets
the
commission
regularly
brings
almost
a
hundred
enforcement
actions
per
year
and
orders
billions
in
monetary
relief
then
of
course
there
are
digital
asset
markets
where
the
commission
has
brought
dozens
of
actions
in
an
incredibly
short
time
contrast
that
with
elections
where
election
or
voter
fraud
is
extremely
rare
and
never
succeeds
at
flipping
the
outcome
of
which
party
controls
congress
even
in
cases
where
election
manipulation
has
been
attempted
it
has
only
succeeded
in
affecting
extremely
small
local
elections
any
attempt
to
manipulate
the
contract
would
most
certainly
involve
a
high
degree
of
speculation
the
contract
is
in
regard
to
the
sum
of
hundreds
of
elections
it
is
not
even
possible
to
determine
which
elections
will
be
the
closest
and
thus
easiest
to
affect
in
advance
even
if
some
races
are
understood
to
be
more
close
than
others
as
detailed
in
appendix
g
a
large
scale
conspiracy
to
coerce
many
individuals
to
vote
a
particular
way
across

different

without

of
sufficient
size
would
mean
that
this
fraud
is
no
ocean

or
even
ocean
11
you
be
looking
at
well
into
the
hundreds
if
not
hundreds
of
thousands
manipulation
of
polling
machines
themselves
is
equally
quixotic
taken
all
in
all
it
is
very
unlikely
that
a
fraud
pertaining
to
this
contract
will
be
attempted
and
considerably
less
likely
than
in
other
areas
that
fall
under
the
commission
enforcement
authority
critically
there
are
already
enormous
stakes
in
elections
creating
incentives
for
outcome
manipulation
this
contract
will
not
change
that
fact
as
discussed
in
extensive
detail
in
appendix
c
in
the
public
comments
and
to
anyone
involved
in
industry
elections
move
prices
and
it
is
specious
to
presume
that
they
do
not
wall
street
firms
and
global
finance
all
trade
elections
the
contract
before
the
commission
is
not
novel
in
that
regard
rather
it
is
a
more
efficient
instrument
than
what
firms
currently
use
to
take
positions
on
elections
19
what
is
the
price
forming
information
for
these
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
if
the
price
forming
information
includes
polling
and
other
election
prediction
information
is
that
information
regulated
how
does
the
price
forming
information
compare
to
informational
sources
government
issued
crop
forecasts
weather
forecasts
federal
government
economic
data
market
derived
supply
and
demand
metrics
for
commodities
market
based
interest
rate
curves
etc
that
are
generally
used
for
pricing
commodity
derivative
products
within
the
commission
jurisdiction
there
is
a
plethora
of
information
used
by
the
public
and
market
participants
to
help
calculate
the
probability
that
a
given
party
will
take
control
of
congress
some
of
these
are
regulated
federal
government
economic
data
but
some
are
not
polls
that
being
said
there
is
no
requirement
that
such
information
be
regulated
nor
is
it
clear
that
regulated
information
is
the
primary
source
of
pricing
information
for
many
commodity
futures
contracts
compared
to
private
market
forecasts
and
data
as
discussed
at
other
points
in
this
response
demand
for
accurate
information
on
election
probabilities
is
in
incredibly
high
demand
by
the
public
and
as
a
result
there
is
a
large
competitive
market
for
such
content
with
regard
to
whether
polling
would
become
regulated
the
answer
is
not
any
more
or
any
less
than
any
of
the
other
information
that
goes
into
pricing
any
commodity
20
should
and
if
so
how
would
the
registered
entity
listing
the
contracts
take
steps
to
address
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involving
the
price
forming
information
for
the
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
the
exchange
has
already
taken
great
steps
to
prevent
and
address
manipulative
behavior
as
in
some
of
the
prior
questions
it
seems
odd
for
the
commission
to
request
only
the
public
input
in
this
regard
but
has
not
discussed
this
with
kalshi
regardless
the
exchange
has
numerous
safeguards
in
place
to
prevent
manipulation
additionally
the
exchange
notes
that
in
particular
concerns
regarding
manipulating
this
contract
are
broadly
unlikely
the
market
for
credible
information
on
elections
and
their
probabilities
is
very
competitive
and
false
information
is
equally
as
likely
to
impact
kalshi
market
as
reports
regarding
the
production
of
oil
do
for
oil
futures
should
false
information
be
reported
the
returns
from
being
an
informed
trader
who
could
sniff
out
so
much
information
would
grow
commensurately
that
being
said
the
exchange
nonetheless
is
extremely
focused
on
making
sure
that
such
concerns
would
not
affect
the
market
for
example
it
has
gated
out
polling
organizations
and
employees
thereof
from
trading
kalshi
engages
in
extensive
market
surveillance
and
employs
know
your
customer
authorization
to
prevent

in
compliance
with
the
core
principles
the

this
is
no
different
it
is
also
important
to
note
what
the
correct
legal
standard
is
which
is
not
free
from
attempted
manipulation
indeed
one
need
only
to
peruse
the
annals
of
the
cftc
enforcement
actions
to
find
many
contracts
that
were
manipulated
libor
or
the
subject
of
an
attempted
manipulation
these
event
contracts
such
as
oil
contracts
interest
rate
swaps
etc
are
significantly
more
likely
and
susceptible
to
be
manipulated
than
this
contract
indeed
the
fact
that
a
contract
like
this
on
a
regulated
market
is
so
unlikely
to
be
manipulated
successfully
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
public
is
so
keen
on
seeing
the
data
from
the
market
which
will
be
far
more
reliable
than
many
other
data
sources
currently
available
21
do
kalshi
limitations
on
market
participation
affect
the
susceptibility
of
the
contracts
markets
for
the
contracts
to
manipulation
do
the
limitations
affect
the
extent
to
which
these
markets
could
be
used
to
influence
perception
of
a

party
or

or
otherwise
be

reasonably
enforceable
in
practice
few
to
no
parties
have
access
to
material
insider
information
on
the
contract
outcome
any
potential
information
an
actor
could
have
is
highly
unlikely
to
be
material
regarding
the
outcome
of
in
total
several
hundred
congressional
races
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
argument
that
congressional
control
can
come
down
to
the
outcome
of
a
handful
of
races
and
some
races
can
be
decided
by
a
margin
of
several
thousand
hundred
or
even
individual
votes
has
little
to
no
bearing
on
the
contract
susceptibility
to
manipulation
the
margin
of
victory
before
an
election
is
unknown
if
a
nefarious
actor
attempted
to
manipulate
the
election
in
order
to
manipulate
the
contract
which
is
what
the
cftc
is
asking
in
this
question
the
actor
would
not
know
beforehand
what
the
margin
of
victory
would
be
that
nefarious
actor
would
have
to
assess
the
size
of
the
electorate
which
is
in
every
instance
going
to
be
large
accordingly
it
is
hard
to
conceive
of
the
definitive
piece
of
material
non
public
information
that
will
swing
the
outcome
of
the
contract
however
like
all
contracts
on
kalshi
there
is
a
prohibition
to
trade
on
material
nonpublic
information
this
contract
is
no
different
in
that
regard
in
response
to
various
indications
from
the
commission
however
the
exchange
adopted
contract
specific
rules
for
this
contract
to
gate
out
certain
people
who
would
be
more
likely
to
have
information
that
could
be
considered
material
nonpublic
information
this
gating
itself
is
the
proverbial
safeguard
on
a
safeguard
as
in
other
questions
kalshi
notes
the
incongruity
of
asking
the
public
for
input
on
how
kalshi
will
enforce
a
rule
without
having
asked
kalshi
regardless
this
rule
is
enforceable
22
should
the
commission
be
responsible
for
surveilling
and
enforcing
against
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involving
the
price
forming
information
for
the
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
it
should
be
responsible
for
surveilling
and
enforcing
against
manipulative
and
false
reporting
activity
while
the
contracts
were
live
as
much
as
it
is
responsible
for
doing
so
with
other
listed
contracts
no
more
no
less
further
the
exchange
notes
that
one
of
the
benefits
of
having
this
activity
on
a
regulated
exchange
is
that
the
commission
will
for
the
first
time
gain
insight
into
the
amount
and
level
of
activity
of
trading
on
congressional
control
currently
if
for
example
congress
would
invite
the
cftc
to
the
hill
and
ask
the
cftc
to
describe
the
current
financial
activity
on
congressional
control
the
cftc
will
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
there
is
activity
some
on
otc
some
on
unregulated
markets
some
overseas
when
pressed
for
details
on
who
is
participating
the
cftc
will
have
to
confess
its
utter
ignorance
however
if
the
contract
were
to
trade
on
regulated
exchanges
the
cftc
will
not
only
know
precisely
what
positions
are
being
taken
on
the
regulated
markets
they
will
know
who
is
taking
them
23
could
trading
in
the
markets
for
the
contracts
obligate
the
commission
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
if
so
is
this
an
appropriate
role
for
the
commission
there
is
no
reason
for
the
commission
to
believe
it
will
be
responsible
for
policing
attempts
at
or
successful
election
fraud
no
more
and
no
less
than
the
cftc
is
responsible
for
any
other
type
of
underlying
fraud
that
has
impacts
on
a
contract
earlier
this
year
there
were
two
individuals
who
were
arrested
for
attempting
to
destroy
power
stations
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
destroying
the
city
of
baltimore
if
successful
the
sabotage
would
have
impacted
electricity
prices
significantly
is
the
cftc
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
prosecution
of
these
two
individuals
is
the
cftc
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
protecting
of
america
power
grid
impacts
the
prices
of
global
oil
including
the
futures
markets
that
the
cftc
regulates
is
the
cftc
therefore
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
meetings
is
the
cftc
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
determination
of
corporate
dividends
that
underlie
the
cme
contract
the
answer
to
all
of
these
is
that
the
cftc
will
get
involved
to
the
extent
that
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
administer
and
enforce
the
cea
the
cftc
does
not
in
any
of
these
cases
assume
the
role
of
the
cop
on
the
beat
this
application
here
is
no
different
election
manipulation
is
a
crime
there
are
law
enforcement
agencies
who
police
elections
and
elections
are
policed
much
more
effectively
than
other
markets
that
have
cftc
derivative
products
trading
on
them
the
commission
is
not
the
only
cop
on
the
beat
with
regard
to
election
fraud
elections
unlike
many
other
reference
markets
or
events
that
have
cftc
derivatives
trading
on
them
are
governed
by
multiple
law
enforcement
agencies
whose
very
existence
is
to
prevent
and
detect
election
manipulation
and
fraud
this
includes
the
federal
election
commission
the
federal
department
of
justice
state
election
commissions
state
secretaries
of
state
and
state
ethics
commissions
history
has
shown
that
these
agencies
are
very
good
at
their
job
the
other
day
the
cftc
brought
an
enforcement
charge
against
alexander
mashinsky
and
celsius
network
llc
where
the
cftc
acknowledged
the
role
that
was
played
by
both
the
sec
and
the
attorney
office
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
similarly
cody
easterday
committed
fraud
that
was
discovered
by
tyson
foods
and
prosecuted
by
the
department
of
justice
the
cftc
also
charged
easterday
presumably
after
cooperating
with
the
relevant
criminal
authorities
these
are
two
examples
of
many
the
cftc
is
well
versed
in
cooperating
with
the
relevant
law
enforcement
agencies
be
it
the
fbi
or
doj
or
any
other
relevant
federal
or
state
authority
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
cftc
would
somehow
lose
that
competency
in
this
case
24
what
other
factors
should
the
commission
consider
in
determining
whether
these
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
has
never
fully
defined
the
full
extent
of
the
factors
it
considers
under
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
even
the
nadex
order
admits
that
the
commission
can
consider
factors
other
than
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
is
not
an
expert
in
all
areas
such
as
election
law
or
integrity
voter
confidence
or
how
to
foster
democracy
and
the
commission
should
instead
focus
on
what
it
knows
the
value
of
a
contract
as
a
hedging
interest
and
the
value
of
a
contract
price
to
market
participants
as
we
noted
in
response
earlier
these
contracts
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
have
a
large
economic
purpose
would
serve
as
a
useful
tool
for
voters
the
media
and
the
public
that
would
fight
information
and
improve
election
integrity
we
note
that
the
evidence
supporting
the
contracts
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
stated
findings
and
purpose
of
the
cea
found
in
7
usc
5
the
contracts
provide
a
means
for
managing
and
assuming
price
risks
discovering
prices
or
disseminating
pricing
information
through
trading
in
liquid
fair
and
financially
secure
trading
facilities
7
usc
these
contracts
and
their
trading
on
kalshi
would
protect
all
market
participants
from
fraudulent
or
other
abusive
sales
practices
and
misuses
of
customer
assets
7
usc
finally
allowing
these
contracts
to
trade
on
a
cftc
regulated
dcm
would
promote
responsible
innovation
and
fair
competition
among
boards
of
trade
other
markets
and
market
participants
ibid
in
sum
these
contracts
are
consistent
with
the
cea
and
its
purposes
and
kalshi
has
shown
that
they
should
be
traded
on
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
with
all
of
the
protections
that
the
cea
makes
available
to
market
participants
the
commission
should
hold

contrary
to

functions
general
risk
management
businesses
face
a
panoply
of
potential
harms
that
will
affect
and
impact
their
value
these
potential
harms
are
risks
risks
include
valuation
risk
the
value
of
the
business
services
or
asset
decline
funding
risk
access
to
credit
or
other
funding
declines
and
operational
risks
possible
disruptions
or
errors
in
the
production
process
that
undermine
their
earnings
among
many
others
each
one
of
these
general
categories
of
risk
will
manifest
and
impact
each
business
according
to
the
business
unique
activities
profile
composition
et
cetera
in
addition
to
these
examples
there
are
many
more
categories
of
risks
including
strategic
risks
getting
outcompeted
by
a
competitor
reputation
risks
liability
risks
and
beyond
there
are
three
steps
that
businesses
generally
follow
when
they
are
managing
the
risk
of
harm
the
first
step
is
to
identify
the
risk
impact
meaning
the
various
places
where
the
business
can
suffer
such
as
its
income
or
valuation
the
second
step
is
for
the
business
to
assess
how
likely
it
is
that
the
potential
harms
will
materialize
and
how
severe
or
acute
will
the
impacts
of
these
harms
be
in
order
to
do
that
the
business
must
consider
the
factors
that
can
affect
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
the
risks
these
include
market
conditions
and
all
related
factors
that
can
have
a
bearing
on
the
potential
harm
this
three
step
process
characterizes
an
appropriate
risk
management
framework
it
works
for
all
manners
of
risks
to
illustrate
a
business
might
identify
that
a
decline
in
profit
margin
is
a
harm
that
it
faces
one
of
the
many
factors
that
could
cause
this
harm
is
changes
in
demand
for
its
product
that
will
change
what
it
can
charge
the
business
wo
stop
there
though
it
will
identify
what
trends
or
events
will
create
a
change
in
demand
for
its
product
for
example
the
business
will
consider
what
market
forces
impact
its
core
customer
base
a
slowdown
in
that
sector
might
have
a
corresponding
downward
impact
on
the
demand
for
the
business
product
to
illustrate
consider
a
builder
of
extra
large
river
barges
in
the
upper
midwest
they
know
that
changes
in
demand
impact
their
risk
but
they
need
to
know
what
affects
demand
naturally
they
look
to
key
factors
such
as
lower
grain
yield
in
the
upper
mississippi
river
v
alley
as
lower
grain
yield
may
mean
lower
need
for
river
barges
both
of
these
are
factors
that
will
impact
the
acuteness
of
the
risk
whether
the
harm
is
likely
to
happen
and
how
severe
it
will
be
if
it
does
happen
as
a
result
they
may
purchase
short
contracts
on
grain
futures
in
order
to
hedge
their
risk
similarly
many
businesses
face
potential
harms
that
are
impacted
by
inflation
inflation
can
impact
nearly
all
term
contracts
impacting
the
business
real
costs
for
instance
a
firm
locked
into
a
10
year
commercial
lease
on
their
office
space
will
see
lower
real
costs
as
a
result
of
inflation
than
with
a
shorter
lease
however
if
the
company
is
also
a
supplier
and
has
locked
in
their
sales
contracts
they
have
agreed
to
sell
tons
of
fertilizer
at
900
ton
then
the
real
value
of
those
sales
decline
and
inflation
will
harm
them
of
course
inflation
affects
many
other
risks
as
well
higher
inflation
raises
the
probability
that
the
federal
reserve
raises
its
target
interest
rates
which
tends
to
substantially
reduce
stock
valuations
and
the
value
of
assets
the
price
of
a
stock
is
often
considered
the
discounted
present
value
of
future
dividends
when
the
interest
rate
the
discount
rate
goes
up
then
the
present
value
of
future
dividends
declines
and
thus
the
stock
value
declines
in
simpler
terms
when
the
interest
rate
goes
up
it
raises
the
relative
value
of
present
money
over
future
profit
so
an
asset
that
incurs
costs
in
the
short
run
but
profits
in
the
long
run
is
less
valuable
when
interest
rates
are
higher
a
stock
which
costs
money
in
the
short
run
but
may
generate
dividends
in
the
long
run
is
thus
less
valuable
when
interest
rates
rise
that
doubly
true
for
growth
stocks
that
may
be
generating
no
profits
now
but
may
generate
them
5
10
years
from
now
inflation
is
just
one
of
many
examples
of
factors
that
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
potential
harms
to
mitigate
those
risks
they
may
seek
to
purchase
any
one
of
many
inflation
hedges
such
as
inflation
swaps
inflation
protected
treasuries
or
inflation
event
contracts
application
to
political
control
contracts
political
control
represents
another
factor
that
could
impact
a
company
risk
profile
much
like
inflation
firms
use
the
same
risk
management
strategy
as
before
a
company
first
identifies
harms
operational
reputational
valuation
credit
and
more
and
then
identifies
the
ways
those
risks
could
change
the
aforementioned
fertilizer
company
may
be
purchasing
fertilizer
inputs
like
potash
from
other
countries
potash
is
often
found
in
russia
belarus
and
china
and
identify
their
largest
operational
risk
as
disruption
in
the
global
potash
supply
chain
they
further
identify
that
changes
in
congressional
political
control
could
increase
the
probability
that
the
supply
chain
is
disrupted
since
different
congresses
may
take
different
approaches
to
tariffs
sanctions
and
other
trade
related
policies
the
election
of
a
new
congress
skeptical
about
status
quo
policy
will
immediately
impact
their
business
by
reducing
the
expected
revenues
of
current
investments
new
investments
and
making
partners
and
investors
skittish
as
a
result
changes
in
political
control
directly
increases
or
decreases
the
firm
operational
risks
perhaps
the
clearest
example
of
this
description
of
risk
management
comes
from
the
cftc
report
managing
climate
risk
in
the
financial
system

ate
of
the
report
the
report
discusses
transition
risk
which
is
defined
as
the
risk
associated
with
the
uncertain
financial
impacts
that
could
result
from
a
transition
to
a
net
zero
emissions
economy
they
note
that
transition
risk
implicates
market
credit
policy
legal
technological
and
reputational
risks
for
firms
and
must
be
a
part
of
any
honest
risk
assessment
most
importantly
the
report
specifically
identifies
how
transition
risks
could
arise
for
example
from
changes
in
policy
along
with
other
factors
such
as
technological
breakthroughs
and
shifts
in
consumer
preferences
and
social
norms
as
the

corroborates

changes
along
with

and
consumer
preference
changes
especially
if
delayed
or
uneven

therefore

academic

that

result
in

2007
they
found
that
there
was
a
consistent
link
between
changes
in

of
who
would
control
congress
and
the
prices
of
equities
government
bonds
and
the
exchange
rates
between
the
dollar
and
foreign

the
fact
that
financial
markets
utilize
political
control
as
a
pricing
factor
demonstrates
that
not
only
are
elections
something
that
should
be
hedged
but
that
firms
are
already
hedging
and
repricing
assets
on
public
markets
if
this
is
the
case
there
is
no
case
to
argue
that

are
not

during

allowed
the

to
isolate
the

of
the

in
political

from
other

during
the

they
concluded
that
markets
expected
a

to
result
in
higher

early
professionals

hill
know
there
are
far
more

there
are
more
congressional

committee
positions
for
them
to
staff
a
consultancy
that
specializes
in
specific
topic
areas
for
example
a
green
energy
consultancy
may
know
the
demand
for
their
services
will
decline
in
anticipation
that
their
issue
of
expertise
is
less
likely
to
be
operative
under
a
split
congress
these
risks
occur
regardless
of
the
legislation
that
actually
passes
there
are
billions
of
dollars
at
risk
surrounding
the
outcome
of

these

all
the
firms
who
identified
how
they
would
use
the

for

are
mistaken
or
deficient
in
their
ability
to
recognize
risk
and
potential
tools
to
manage

mitigate
that

it

when
most
others

state
that

thus
it

that

this
reality
is
recognized
by
the

the

managing

in

the
partisan
makeup
of

is
a
critical
factor
of
policy
risk
that
kalshi

addresses
even
if
the

the

is
best
positioned
to
make
that
determination
not
the

or
kalshi
if
that

is
too
tangential
then
the

will
be
a
commercial
failure
with
a

designed
for

such
as
this
contract
with
its
minimum

size
and
increased

limits
the
market
and
market

will
be

to
determine
their
own

and
whether
the

is
a
necessary
component
of
their

or
not
that
is
a
decision
that
is

left
to
the

for
themselves
how
the

can
be

to
hedge

in

note
that
the

is
not

that
can
hedge

it
is
not

for

and
it
is

the

is
appropriate
for
businesses
that
face

impacted
by

of

for
those
businesses
the

can
be
an
important

and

of
their
overall

management
process
a

that

the
business
will
identify
the
potential
harms
that
the
company
faces
naturally
there
are
many
operational
risks
what
if
a
rig
breaks
but
those
are
hardly
the
only
risks
they
face
some
other
risks
are
enumerated
below
increases
in
transportation
costs
which
could
affect
the
cost
of
transporting
specialized
boring
equipment
this
may
occur
due
to
increases
in
trucking
rates
or
changes
in
gas
diesel
prices
for
illustration
let
us
say
that
every
1
increase
in
transportation
costs
costs
the
firm
changes
in
the
price
they
can
sell
their
goods
which
could
occur
due
to
rising
energy
prices
or
government
rebates
for
example
suppose
a
1
increase
in
energy
costs
increases
firm
profits
by
a
shift
in
the
demand
curve
for
their
services
there
is
a
subtle
but
important
distinction
between
changes
in
services
demand
due
to
lower
prices
which
in
economic
terms
would
be
considered
a
move
along
the
same
demand
curve
and
a
shift
in
the
demand
curve
whereby
demand
is
different
even
if
the
price
remains
the
same
as
before
this
scenario
could
occur
due
to
changes
in
environmental
rules
inducing
more
industrial
firms
to
purchase
zero
carbon
electricity
or
changes
in
subsidies
and
tax
credits
that
makes
their
product
more
affordable
for
firms
when
compared
to
fossil
fuel
services
suppose
a
ceteris
paribus
1
increase
in
demand
would
increase
firm
profits
by
changes
in
retained
profits
this
could
occur
due
to
changing
revenues
changing
costs
but
also
changing
corporate
tax
rates
including
marginal
rates
and
depreciation
treatment
suppose
reversing
the
2017
tax
cuts
would
all
else
equal
increase
firm
costs
by
5
million
changes
in
expansion
opportunities
this
could
occur
due
to
changes
in
permitting
standards
that
may
affect
the
speed
at
which
the
firm
can
develop
new
geothermal
sites
or
changes
in
environmental
standards
may
affect
which
sites
can
be
developed
changes
in
expansion
costs
this
may
occur
due
to
changes
in
interest
rates
may
affect
the
cost
of
financing
new
rigs
and
sites
or
changes
litigation
costs
from
nepa
rules
that
affect
whether
local
groups
can
sue
to
stop
a
new
site
development
the
firm
will
assess
what
are
the
factors
that
will
impact
each
of
their
potential
harms
factors
that
can
impact
the
likelihood
of
harms
materializing
and
factors
that
can
impact
the
severity
of
harms
should
they
materialize
not
every
harm
will
be
directly
impacted
by
elections
and
political
control
and
the
contract
will
not
be
a
part
of
every
hedging
strategy
looking
at
the
transportation
cost
variable
for
instance
the
firm
may
decide
that
trucking
rates
are
likely
unaffected
by
changes
in
congressional
control
though
in
2022
congress
vote
on
the
freight
rail
strike
did
likely
affect
trucking
prices
a
firm
may
not
consider
this
frequent
enough
to
be
worth
calculating
and
gas
prices
while
related
to
political
variables
is
not
easily
anticipated
by
changes
in
congressional
majorities
regarding
their
output
price
while
wholesale
energy
prices
are
certainly
influenced
by
political
variables
the
firm
may
determine
that
the
relationship
to
elections
are
too
attenuated
to
evaluate
likewise
while
permitting
standards
under
the
national
environmental
policy
act
is
a
top
priority
for
the
118th
congress
it
widely
viewed
as
a
bipartisan
priority
and
thus
unlikely
to
change
regardless
of
how
political
conditions
evolve
but
the
business
may
determine
that
other
potential
harms
will
be
directly
impacted
by
elections
and
political
control
for
example
retained
profits
and
shifts
in
the
demand
curve
are
influenced
by
which
party
wins
congress
as
parties
have
substantially
different
positions
on
corporate
taxes
zero
carbon
subsidies
and
emission
standards
for
industrial
processes
30
as
a
result
depending
on
how
the
congressional
election
plays
out
certain
risks
become
more
salient
mitigatory
actions
may
be
insufficient
the
firm
can
not
cost
efficiently
diversify
into
fossil
fuels
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
clean
energy
subsidy
policy
in
the
same
way
a
corn
farmer
can
not
cost
efficiently
diversify
into
an
uncorrelated
domain
in
order
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
agriculture
prices
a
firm
may
conduct
some
simple
math
a
given
party
winning
may
increase
the
probability
of
beneficial
tax
changes
by
20
creating
an
expectation
of
1
million
5
million
20
more
in
retained
profits
but
have
a
50
chance
of
enacting
environmental
rules
that
reduce
demand
by
10
creating
an
expectation
of
loss
of
million
50
as
a
result
a
financial
hedging
product
may
be
more
appropriate
suppose
the
probability
of
party
x
winning
control
of
congress
was
and
the
price
of
the
5000
contract
was
thus
in
that
case
they
would
purchase
60
contracts
for
a
total
of
if
the
adverse
event
does
occur
the
firm
would
be
paid
to
compensate
for
their
expected
losses
if
the
adverse
event
does
not
occur
they
would
not
be
paid
but
they
would
reap
the
benefits
of
the
more
favorable
event
occurring
or
consider
a
firm
specializing
in
providing
specialized
lab

conditions
they
regularly
take
stock
of
their

biggest
risk
factors
they
include
changes
in
research
and
development
financing
costs
three
major
factors
include
changes
in
funding
to
the
national
science
foundation
nsf
and
national
institutes
of
health
nih
changes
in
interest
rates
and
research
and
development
tax
breaks
they
estimate
that
every
1
percentage
point
increase
in
interest
rates
increases
their
costs
by
5
million
changes
in
regulatory
approval
costs
one
major
contributor
to
the
risk
is
the
probability
that
congress
changes
the
law
such
that
ldts
are
treated
the
same
as
all
commercial
use
diagnostic
tests
thereby
changing
from
the
regulatory
remit
of
the
center
for
medicare
services
cms
to
the
food
and
drug
administration
fda
where
approval
timelines
are
typically
substantially
longer
they
estimate
that
change
would
add
an
additional
six
months
to
their
approval
process
which
could
cost
them
roughly
25
million
per
year
changes
in
revenue
and
profit
which
could
be
affected
by
changes
in
medicare
reimbursement
rates
which
may
affect
the
willingness
of
hospitals
to
offer
their
tests
they
estimate
that
a
reduction
of
1
in
the
medicare
reimbursement
rate
change
would
cost
them
10
million
per
year
another
factor
related
to
this
risk
is
changes
in
corporate
taxes
including
marginal
rates
which
may
affect
overall
profitability
they
estimate
reversing
the
2017
corporate
tax
reductions
could
cost
their
company
3
million
the
firm
may
determine
that
nsf
nih
funding
remains
a
bipartisan
priority
and
is
unlikely
to
change
regardless
of
the
results
of
the
congressional
elections
likewise
the
effect
on
interest
rates
from
congress
may
be
too
attenuated
to
effectively
assess
but
they
determine
that
legislation
to
change
the
regulatory
treatment
of
ldts
is
more
likely
under
one
political
coalition
than
another
since
they
are
a
firm
specializing
in
ldts
this
risk
could
be
quite
severe
as
a
result
they
may
wish
to
purchase
a
financial
product
that
mitigates
their
risk
exposure
the
relationship
between
the
election
and
their
risks
is
sufficiently
direct
that
a
financial
hedge
may
be
valuable
for
instance
suppose
they
believe
that
party
x
winning
the
midterm
election
would
result
in
a
16
percentage
point
increase
in
the
probability
that
ldt
reform
legislation
becomes
law
as
a
result
the
election
of
party
x
creates
4
million
in
risk
through
that
channel
alone
25
m
however
party
x
winning
also
reduces
the
probability
of
costly
corporate
tax
changes
by
33
thereby
reducing
the
expected
loss
by
1
million
as
a
result
they
may
wish
to
purchase
3
million
of
hedging
products
to
zero
out
their
extant
election
risks
which
they
could
do
so
by
purchasing
contracts
they
may
also
wish
to
only
partially
hedge
by
purchasing
less
than
that
critically
even
though
the
election
is
not
deterministic
on
their
bottom
line
it
has
clear
and
unambiguous
effects
on
risks
to
their
profitability
that
can
be
hedged
similarities
to
existing
products
many
products
listed
on
commission
regulated

mitigate
risk
in
a
similar
manner
to

instance

this
is
not
the
standard
that
the
commission
should
apply
in
its
decision
it
is
not
the
standard
applied
in
nadex
which
considered
whether
nadex
proposal
could
base
the
price
of
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
it
is
also
not
the
standard
that
the
commission
asked
the
public
to
use
in
judging
kalshi
original
submission
which
uses
the
same
test
as
nadex
to
do
otherwise
and
limit
price
basing
to
only
contracts
with
an
underlying
cash
market
would
be
arbitrary
it
would
also
essentially
invalidate
the
existence
of
price
basing
or
price
discovery
for
the
vast
majority
of
event
contracts
which
do
not
have
underlying
cash
markets
this
is
inconsistent
with
commission
precedent
and
would
upend
myriad
products
listed
with
the
commission
in
the
last
two
decades
many
derivatives
products
currently
listed
with
commission
registered
designated
contract
markets
do
not
have
underlying
cash
markets
such
as
indicator
derivatives
gross
domestic
product
contracts
rate
derivatives
mgex
corporate
tax
rate
futures

based
on

because
of
the
permissionless
nature
of
self
certification
the
commission
has
not
specifically
stated
that
the
above
contracts
have
hedging
or
price
basing
utilities
the
commission
did
so
implicitly
by
permitting
their
registration
for
decades
however
in
some
cases
the
commision
has
been
specific
for
example
the
commission
actively
determined
that
futures
which
pay
off
based
on
the
amount
of
box
office
revenue
a
motion
picture
produces
has
price
basing
utility
even
though
it
has
no
cash
commodity
market
the
commission
found
that
the
contracts
can
perform
hedging
and
price
discovery
purposes
the
commission
analysis
applied
three
tests
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
contracts
could
be
used
by
an
identifiable
segment
of
an
industry
or
industries
for
hedging
or
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
the
price
basing
value
of
kalshi
proposal
is
no
different
a
market
based
determination
of
the
probability
of
a
given
party
taking
control
of
a
given
chamber
of
congress
would
be
helpful
in
basing
the
price
of
politically
sensitive
commodities
such
as
oil
assets
such
as
politically
sensitive
stocks
like
cannabis
and
energy
firms
and
services
such
as
investments
in
politically
sensitive
sectors
there
is
no
hard
and
fast
rule
defining
when
price
basing
does
and
does
occur
in
a
manner
sufficient
to
justify
a
cftc
listed
derivative
in
some
cases
the
commission
commission
staff
indicated
that
price
basing
is
when
a
commodity
future
specifically
bases
the
price
of
its
underlying
commodity
in
other
cases
also
related
commodities
for
example
the
cftc
rule
on
exempt
commercial
markets
describes
price
basing
this
way
at
some
points
as
does
the
definition
provided
on
the
commission
website
at
other
points
the
rule
refers
to
price
basing
as
being
about
only
the
underlying
commodity
itself
in
other
cases
including
kalshi
also
non
commodities
for
example
the
commission
decision
in
nadex
or
the
commission
questions
for
the
public
in
kalshi
original
submission
specifically
discuss
whether
the
contracts
can
be
used
for
basing
the
price
of
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
the
commodity
exchange
act
also
does
not
specify
what

or
should
be

fact
in

discussing

in
2008
commission
staff
used
election
markets
to
describe
how
price
discovery
in
event
contracts
could
work
as
noted
above
the
commission
release
stated
that
the
trading
of
such
contracts
can
facilitate
the
discovery
of
information
by
assigning
probabilities
through
market
derived
prices
to
discrete
eventualities
for
example
a
binary
contract
based
on
whether
a
particular
person
will
run
for
the
presidency
in
2012
can
pay
a
fixed
100
to
its
buyer
if
and
only
if
that
individual
runs
for
the
presidency
in
2012
if
the
contract
traders
believe
that
the
likelihood
of
the
individual
candidacy
in
2012
is
around
17
percent
the
price
of
the
contract
will
be
around
17
and
will
approximate
the
market
consensus
expectation
of
the
individual
candidacy
ment
of
event
contracts
this
utility
was
true
then
and
it
remains
true
today
the
fact
that
the
concept
release
predated
dodd
frank
is
of
no
consequence
the
point
is
that
the
contract
has
obvious
price
basing
utility
and
even
if
dodd
frank
arguendo
reincarnated
the
economic
utility
test
the
contract
passes
because
of
its
price
basing
utility
the
law
similarly
does
not
restrict
price
basing
to
specifically
the
commodity
upon
which
the
derivative
is
based
specifically
the
cea
says
transactions
subject
to
this
act
are
entered
into
regularly
in
interstate
and

commerce
and
are
affected
with

national
public

managing
and

risks
discovery
prices
or
disseminating
pricing
information
through
trading
in
liquid
fair
and
financially
secure
trading
facilities
even
if
the
commission
had
used
the
standard
whereby
price
basing
only
applies
to
an
underlying
cash
market
and
it
has
not
at
one
point
why
should
it
continue
to
do
so
in
the
future
the
fact
that
a
derivative
can
provide
price
discovery
for
a
different
commodity
asset
or
service
is
consistent
with
the
cea
price
discovery
goals
stopping
a
derivative
from
being
listed
on
that
basis
is
inconsistent
with
it
moreover
the
fact
that
a
derivative
could
be
used
for
price
discovery
for
another
kind
of
product
or
service
suggests
relation
falling
within
one
of
the
common
definitions
commission
staff
use
in
describing
price
basing
that
being
said
if
the
standard
was
related
commodity
election
markets
are
patently
related
to
major
commodity

major
participant
in
such
markets
both

subsidies
in
addition

has
consistently
found
a
link
between

is
a
division
of
the
library
of
congress
with
multiple
checks
on
publishing
data
for
example
given
that
is
publicly
available
for
any
congressional
official
or
member
of
the
public
to
access
discrepancies
between
whether
an
individual
has
or
has
not
been
made
leader
on
and
their
party
membership
would
likely
be
detected
quickly
making
manipulation
of
the
website
unlikely
in
addition
to
the
general
availability
of
the
contract
relates
to
a
high
profile
event
which
is
the
subject
of
immense
media
coverage
and
interest
thus
any
attempt
to
publish
incorrect
data
would
be
quickly
noticed
and
identified
the
negative
consequences
that
library
of
congress
staff
would
likely
face
for
publishing
incorrect
data
in
order
to
intentionally
manipulate
the
market
would
also
serve
as
a
strong
disincentive
from
attempting
manipulation
with
regard
to
possible
outcome
manipulation
it
is
clear
that
the
totality
of
congressional
elections
are
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
the
only
groups
that
can
directly
affect
the
leadership
decisions
are
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
members
of
this
group
are
extremely
unlikely
to
attempt
intentional
manipulation
of
the
leadership
of
their
chambers
to
settle
the
contract
a
certain
way
the
economic
and
political
ramifications
of
which
are
far
greater
than
the
position
limits
on
the
exchange
instead
of
considering
the
potential
outcome
of
the
contract
on
the
exchange
legislators
involved
with
the
confirmation
are
more
likely
to
incorporate
other
factors
into
their
decision
making
process
such
as
political
circumstances
the
weight
of
these
factors
is
much
greater
than
any
consideration
of
a
market
on
the
exchange
thus
manipulation
for
the
sole
purpose
of
influencing
the
outcome
of
the
contract
is
unlikely
the
amount
of
media
attention
and
financial
reporting
done
on
potential
changes
in
leadership
means
that
opportunistic
attempts
to
manipulate
reporting
to
affect
prices
is
likely
to
be
ignored
given
the
amount
of
attention
given
to
the
subject
members
of
congress
also
have
a
sworn
duty
to
represent
their
constituents
and
would
not
manipulate
congressional
processes
for
private
gain
their
finances
are
also
heavily
monitored
and
subject
to
public
disclosure
and
scrutiny
moreover
election
officials
swear
an
oath
to
faithfully
uphold
the
results
of
the
elections
tampering
with
federal
elections
is
a
serious
federal
crime
and
the
consequences
of

be
quite
severe

any
close
election
results
in
a
recount
and
therefore
any
manipulation
by
an
individual
or
small
group
of
individuals
could
reasonably
be

to
be

this

election
trading
is
alive
and
well
in
other
democracies
like
the
united
kingdom
without
documented
attempts
at
let
alone
successful
manipulation
any
effort
to
coordinate
votes
for
the
sake
of
the
contract
would
take
significant
planning
and
coordination
and
is
unlikely
to
occur
because
none
can
know
beforehand
what
the
margin
of
victory
is
going
to
be
accordingly
the
organizers
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
the
size
of
the
conspiracy
they
would
need
to
orchestrate
such
an
attempt
would
be
implausible
large
scale
coordination
of
sufficient
volume
to
affect
an
election
of
even
a
few
hundred
thousand
voters
as
exists
in
the
smallest
states
or
mid
size
cities
would
be
too
large
to
avoid
scrutiny
from
market
surveillance
and
counter
partisan
mobilization
nearly
every
commodity
market
can
be
altered
if
tens
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
all
conspire
simultaneously
however
it
is
nearly
impossible
to
coordinate
across
tens
of
thousands
of
individuals
without
being
visible
if
this
was
a
viable
path
then
highly
motivated
partisans
would
already
attempt
to
do
so
and
profit
from
the
myriad
ways
they
could
profit
by
knowing
the
outcome
of
an
election
beforehand
the
reason
this
type
of
criminal
activity
does
not
occur
is
that
such
a
scheme
would
be
readily
detected
one
may
also
imagine
that
a
coordinated
group
of
individuals
may
conspire
to
manipulate
market
prices
to
give
the
false
impression
of
candidate
momentum
thus
potentially
harming
the
democratic
process
this
concern
too
is
empirically
implausible
coleman
and
strumpf
in
a
later
paper
examined
previous
american
political
prediction
markets
and
found
that
no
previous
effort
at

were
capable
of
sustaining
anything
more
than
fleeting

they
wrote
we
find
little

that

the

ryan
oprea
found
in
one
paper
one
major
reason
why
political

are
rather
invulnerable

is
that

in

there
are
also
legal
protections
against

the

the

a

right
in
the
vast

statutorily

in
the
rest
the
lack
of
substantiated
attempts
at
manipulation
of
political
control
contracts
by
such
methods
is
quite
telling
in
the
context
of
how
much
is
already
at
stake
in
american
elections
the
economic
impacts
of

dwarf
the
value

kalshi

entire

can
be
favored
by
a

almost
every

the

not

thus
not
