here
how
the
dollar
is
tracking
biden
chances
of
victory
in
november
ap
though
the
presidential
election
is
still
five
months
away
analysts
are
continuing
to
weigh
in
on
how
the
race
could
impact
financial
markets
one
example
comes
from
deutsche
bank
strategist
alan
ruskin
in
a
note
on
sunday
he
wrote
that
since
the
start
of
2024
there
been
a
73
correlation
between
the
ice
dollar
index
and
the
probability
of
a
victory
for
president
joe
biden
as
implied
by
predictit
the
new
zealand
based
online
prediction
market
a
strong
economy
is
biden
positive
and
probably
usd
positive
through
the
rates
channel
ruskin
wrote
but
a
stronger
economy
that
keeps
inflation
expectations
elevated
would
almost
certainly
be
negative
for
risky
assets
and
biden
chances
even
as
it
might
support
the
usd
most
obviously
versus
the
high
beta
currencies
meanwhile
the
chances
of
a
victory
for
former
president
donald
trump
the
presumptive
republican
nominee
are
also
likely
to
be
viewed
as
usd
positive
negative
for
the
cny
chinese
onshore
yuan
and
eur
euro
particularly
and
to
a
lesser
degree
mxn
mexico
peso
the
strategist
added
this
usd
positive
bydefault
view
may
get
watered
down
depending
on
how
much
the
trump
campaign
overtly
talks
about
the
need
for
a
weaker
usd
or
attacks
fed
independence
a
rematch
between
biden
and
trump
has
been
labeled
by
some
observers
as
one
that
nobody
wants
with
potential
voters
concerned
about
the
former
age
and
the
latter
legal
problems
biden
is
81
and
trump
who
is
77
was
convicted
on
34
felony
charges
in
a
hush
money
case
in
new
york
last
week
trump
chances
of
winning
the
white
house
race
appear
to
have
declined
since
the
verdict
according
to
polls
however
predictit
is
still
pointing
to
almost
even
odds
of
a
victory
by
either
candidate
and
strategists
are
still
trying
to
figure
out
the
possible
market
implications
of
the
election
outcome
as
of
monday
afternoon
the
dollar
index
was
down
at
around
but
still
up
by
since
