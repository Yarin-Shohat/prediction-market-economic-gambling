iatp
strongly
supports
the
preamble
of
the
npr
and
the
proposed
amendments
to
the
review
of
event
contracts
based
upon
certain
excluded
commodities
this
short
comment
emphasizes
the
well
reasoned
statutory
and
regulatory
foundation
for
the
npr
regarding
the
definitions
of
war
and
terrorism
in
an
amended
we
propose
that
the
commission
consider
further
definitions
of
excluded
commodities
in
to
anticipate
possible
regulatory
evasion
of
prohibited
contracts
for
example
should
the
current
prohibition
on
contracts
involving
war
need
further
definition
to
include
not
just
hostile
military
acts
between
states
but
also
state
sponsoring
of
or
state
affiliation
with
private
actors
that
attempt
to
destroy
or
disable
computer
networked
physical
and
financial
infrastructure
the
preamble
states
the
commission
does
not
believe
that
it
is
necessary
to
define
terrorism
assassination
or
war
at
this
time
federal
register
fr
48977
a
footnote
to
this
sentence
explains
the
commission
clarifies
however
that
it
believes
that
cyberattacks
and
other
acts
of
cyberterrorism
constitute
terrorism
and
in
some
cases
war
and
are
also
likely
to
constitute
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
footnote

while
iatp
appreciates
this
clarification
preambles
although
crucial
for
understanding
an
agency
reasoning
about
a
regulation
are
not
legally
enforceable
the
federal
definitions
of
terrorism
do
not
anticipate
that
the
intention
of
a
terroristic
attack
could
be
economic
gain
or
disruption
the
commission
technology
advisory
committee
cybersecurity
subcommittee
will
soon
be
presenting
its
report
and
recommendations
on
cybersecurity
and
financial
markets
before
the
commission
finalizes
its
definitions
for
the
revised
it
should
review
the
report
to
help
it
decide
whether
the
risks
to
markets
of
cyberattacks
and
cybersecurity
failures
merits
an
amended
definition
of
war
and
terrorism
in
the
rule
or
whether
the
footnoted
clarification
will
suffice
in
theory
the
statute
and
the
inclusion
of
similar
activities
to
those
explicitly
prohibited
as
involved
in
event
contracts
might
be
considered
as
an
adequate
firewall
against
such
event
contract
regulatory
evasion
of
prohibited
enumerated
activities
however
we
live
in
a
perilous
jurisprudential
landscape
in
which
long
standing
precedents
in
the
delegation
of
statutory
authority
and
administrative
law
are
in
jeopardy
therefore
we
contend
the
commission
should
consider
defining
war
and
terrorism
as
prohibited
activities
involved
in
the
listing
of
derivatives
contracts
if
the
commission
decides
that
such
definitions
are
not
warranted
we
urge
the
commission
to
include
footnote
85
in
the
amended
rule
itself
regarding
the
npr
proposed
methodology
for
evaluating
event
contracts
the
npr
is
not
a
review
of
a
single

the

gives
a
sample
of
those

it
is
important
to

the

if
it

notes
as

the

containing

in
the
form
of
factors
the
commission
may
consider
in

to
other
factors
the
commission
deems
appropriate
in
light
of
individual
facts
and

when
making
a
determination
under

such
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public

fr

appendix
e
together
with
the
final
rule
will
supply
the
ex
ante
guidance
that
fia
and
other
market
participants
have
requested
about
event
contracts
the
npr
describes
a
two
step
general
methodology
to
determine
whether
a
proposed
event
contract
or
swap
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
first
the
commission
must
assess
whether
a
contract
in
a
specified
excluded
commodity
an
activity
enumerated
in
cea
section
each
an
enumerated
activity
or
other
similar
activity
as
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
prescribed
similar
activity
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
involves
such
activity
the
commission
must
assess
whether
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
fr
48971
although
this
methodology
is
clear
and
straightforward
its
application
to
each
proposed
event
contract
would
be
time
and
resource
intensive
both
for
the
dcm
researching
and
designing
the
proposed
contract
and
commission
staff
reviewing
it
according
to
the
two
step
process
therefore
the
preamble
and
the
amended
rule
advise
dcms
of
which
types
of
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
such
as
war
and
gaming
that
the
commission
will
determine
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
ar
e
prohibited
iatp
agrees
with
the
commission
reasoning
and
conclusion
that
the
amended
rule
will
both
assist
dcm
business
planning
and
contract
design
while
conserving
commission
staff
resources
from
repeated
reviews
of
individual
contracts
that
may
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
fr
48972
nevertheless
despite
this
two
step
methodology
for
types
of
event
contracts
the
preamble
allows
that
the
commission
may
have
to
review
individual
contracts
in
cases
where
the
contract
characteristics
involved
with
gaming
do
not
clearly
identify
it
as
a
prohibited
contract
fr
48974
in
sum
this
methodology
is
pragmatic
but
not
inflexibly
dogmatic
in
the
following
section
iatp
affirms
the
commission
statutory
authority
for
and
regulatory
implementation
involving
types
of
contracts
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
conclude
our
comment
with
remarks
on
gaming
the
one
enumerated
activity
that
the
commission
proposes
to
define
in
its
amendments
to
the
alignment
of
the
commission
statutory
authority

the
statutory
authority
for

provides
for
the
commission
to
make
determinations
about
which
type
of
event
contracts
and
swaps
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if

or

a

that

determine
to
make

on

notes
the

determination
to

if

to

interest
determinations
on
a

by

basis
much
of

work

the
division
of

would
be
delayed
given

this

proposes
that
the

will
evaluate
a

of
event

namely
prohibited
contracts
by
revising

which
currently
reads

to
delete

references
from

align
the
rule
more
closely
with
the
language
of
its
corresponding
statutory
authority
we
also
agree
that
gaming
should
be
further
defined
as
we
outline
in
the
next
section
the
impetus
for
the
proposed
amendments
to
is
not
the
review
of
any
one
event
contract
but
the
rapid
increase
in
the
number
of
dcm
self
certified
event
contracts
since
was
promulgated
in
2011
the
preamble
does
not
refer
to
any
commission
review
of
a

contract
based
on
an
excluded

this
increase
is
summarized
in

in

from
2006
dcms

an
average
of

five

this
number
increased
to
131
and
the
number
of
newly
listed
event
contracts
per
year
has
remained
at
a
similar
level
in
subsequent
years
since
2021
dcms
also
have
listed
for
trading
a
substantial
number
of
event
contracts
not
associated
with
traditional
commodities
financial
indices
or
economic
indicators
some
of
these
event

do
not
serve
the
commercial
hedging
purpose
of
traditional
commodity

nor
do
they
have
corresponding

whose

iatp
strongly
agrees
with

or
the
availability

may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity

iatp
does
not
believe
that
the
definition

the

contravenes
that
ruling
to

establishments

based

however
iatp
can
not
predict
how
courts
will
review
a
final

rule
the
commission
is
prudent
to
ask
if
on
judicial
review
it
is
determined
that
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political

does
not

the

may

is
similar

aming

staking
something
of

on

similar
to

fr
48977
in
the
event
of
an
adverse
court
ruling
concerning
a
final
amended
the
commission
should
consider
whether
a
political
event
contract
is
similar
to
gaming
a
strong
foundation
for
this
consideration
is
the
commission

of

defining

interpreting

iatp
supports
a
review
of
event
contracts
similar

in
part
because

well
analysis
of

the
supporting

of

the

argues
that
the

is
being
paternalistic
when
it
seeks
to
protect

participants
who
are
investing
in

in

with

institutional

fr

while
it
is
true
that
the

lacks

comparable
to
that
for

commission
protection
of

customers
it
does
not
follow
that
the

should
ignore
or
diminish
the
protection
of
retail
market
participants
in
event

if
a
category
of

disadvantages
retail
market
participants
compared
to
institutional

with
far
greater
information
and
financial
resources
the
commission
protection
of
retail
investors
is
not
paternalistic
the
commission
has
various
means
to
protect
retail
investors
fraud
alerts
and
educational
programs
but
the
discretion
to
determine
which
category
of
contracts
are
contrary

is
yet
another
indispensable
means
of
