this
comment
is
on
behalf
of
temper
one
of
america
leading
health
and
nutrition
startups
specifically
temper
sells
a
novel
cannabinoid
mint
for
diet
management
election
contracts
would
allow
temper
to
reduce
its
risk
exposure
to
federal
elections
and
would
thus
be
a
welcome
addition
to
the
event
contracts
space
as
a
company
that
sells
a
product
that
involves
cannabinoids
federal
policy
is
a
key
determinant
of
our
success
the
lack
of
clarity
at
a
federal
level
for
hemp
and
cannabinoids
has
made
securing
financing
customers
corporate
partnerships
and
advertising
more
difficult
than
it
otherwise
would
be
large
financiers
such
as
pension
funds
and
sovereign
wealth
funds
are
reluctant
to
invest
money
in
a
company
that
could
face
crackdowns
in
the
face
of
a
hostile
new
government
without
regulatory
clarity
taking
the
next
step
to
becoming
an
even
larger
company
is
difficult
however
it
is
abundantly
clear
the
differences
between
the
two
parties
on
cannabis
policy
the
democratic
party
is
far
more
sympathetic
to
complete
legalization
and
hostile
to
enforcement
efforts
in
contrast
the
republican
party
is
much
more
critical
the
odds
of
complete
legalization
and
regulatory
clarity
substantially
fall
if
the
republican
party
gained
control
of
at
least
one
house
of
congress
notably
the
harms
manifest
to
a
company
like
ours
even
before
any
policy
action
is
taken
as
financiers
and
corporate
partners
may
be
skittish
in
anticipation
of
potential
action
as
a
result
the
outcomes
of
congressional
control
are
more
than
sufficiently
predictable
for
us
to
use
the
product
for
its
hedging
purposes
in
addition
as
we
plan
to
take
the
next
steps
in
our
business
the
probabilities
generated
by
the
contract
prices
could
be
powerful
inputs
who
is
in
power
come
january
2023
might
affect
our
expansion
plans
our
growth
strategy
and
beyond
having
a
market
driven
data
point
that
updates
rapidly
and
is
not
subject
to
ideological
bias
could
be
helpful
in
facilitating
the
best
decision
making
process
possible
for
thousands
of
companies
including
our
own
congressional
control
is
no
game
it
is
a
real
threat
to
our
business
bottom
line
the
same
way
a
public
health
emergency
or
a
natural
disaster
or
an
economic
downturn
might
be
a
threat
to
other
businesses
we
should
be
able
to
access
the
same
tools
to
manage
those
risks
as
we
can
manage
those
others
dismissing
this
valuable
product
on
the
grounds
that
it
could
be
used
for
gaming
or
can
not
be
used
for
hedging
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
experience
of
our
company
and
many
others
we
would
suggest
kindly
that
the
commission
allow
the
contract
to
move
forward
