for

in

and
under

and
o

states
as
follows
1
paradigm
is
an
american
investment
firm
that
backs
entrepreneurs
building
companies
and
protocols
that
leverage
crypto
and
related
technologies
at
the
frontier
of
innovation
paradigm
takes
a
hands
on
approach
to
helping
these
projects
achieve
their
full
potential
it
provides
services
that
range
from
technical
mechanism
design
smart
contract
security
and
engineering
to
operational
recruiting
and
regulatory
strategy
2
paradigm
has
an
interest
in
this
case
because
prediction
markets
could
be
an
impactful
use
case
for
crypto
and
related
technologies
in
which
paradigm
invests
paradigm
also
has
an
interest
in
supporting
the
broad
availability
of
regulated
prediction
markets
which
are
a
valuable
source
of
public
information
and
allow
market
participants
including
crypto
investors
and
entrepreneurs
to
hedge
their
exposure
to
specific
events
3
an
amicus
brief
from
paradigm
is
desirable
because
paradigm
investment
experience
gives
it
an
on
the
ground
view
of
how
today
most
innovative
companies
manage
risk
4
the
matters
asserted
in
paradigm
brief
are
relevant
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
because
a
key
legal
question
before
the
court
is
whether
event
contracts
involving
congressional
control
are
in
the
public
interest
paradigm
brief
draws
on
paradigm
market
experience
to
give
examples
and
explain
multiple
ways
in
which
these
event
contracts
are
in
the
public
interest
5
paradigm
position
is
not
adequately
represented
by
the
parties
because
the
parties
lack
paradigm
real
world
investment
experience
in
crypto

the

for

event

like
the
ones
plaintiff
kalshiex
llc
seeks
to
list
on
its
exchange
advance
two
public
interests
first
they
allow
parties
directly
impacted
by
political
outcomes
to
mitigate
risk
by
hedging
second
they
provide
information
that
the
public
can
use
to
better
predict
and
thus
plan
for
a
given
outcome
consider
an
entrepreneur
who
is
building
a
crypto
startup
in
the
the
likelihood
that
congress
will
pass
legislation
that
will
impact
the
viability
of
crypto
startups
is
directly
affected
by
which
party
is
in
control
of
congress
and
by
whether
the
government
is
divided
the
entrepreneur
may
therefore
want
to
buy
an
event
contract
that
pays
out
depending
on
which
party
takes
control
of
congress
in
order
to
hedge
its
regulatory
risk
moreover
when
market
participants
hedge
substantial
sums
on
a
particular
event
contract
members
of
the
general
public
even
those
who
never
join
the
market
get
valuable
real
time
information
event
markets
might
even
be
better
predictors
of
electoral
outcomes
than
public
opinion
polling
precisely
because
they
require

to
put
their
own
skin
in
the

in

event
contracts
tied

congressional
control
are
a

the

allowing

hedge
financial

congressional
power
manifests
in
ways
that
create
risk
at
aggregate
and
granular
levels
congressional
control
contracts
provide
a
mechanism
for
market
participants
to
mitigate
those
risks
in
ways
that
event
contracts
tied
to
specific
policy
outcomes
do

congressional

or

poses
inherent
financial
risk
the
congress
wields
many
powers
the
uncertainty
surrounding
how
congress
will
wield
those
powers
is
compounded
by
the
uncertainties
of
future
partisan
control
anyone
subject
to
congressional
action
that
is
everyone
has
an
interest
in
mitigating
the
risks
associated
with
different
potential
outcomes
legislation
congress
primary
duty
is
to
legislate
to
create
amend
and
repeal
laws
those
laws
can
have
drastic
financial
effects
consider
the
farm
bill
which
is
a
multiyear
law
that
regulates
several
agricultural
and
food
programs
the
current
farm
bill
includes
provisions

but
there
is
no
guarantee
that
those
provisions
will
be
part
of
the
next
farm
bill
creating
financial
risk
for
any
farmer
who
relies
on
them
another
example
is
the
potential
passage
of
a
crypto

bill
various

have

but
the
probability
of
any
bill
becoming
law
will
significantly
depend
on
which
party
is
in
control
of
congress
going
back
to
the
earlier
example
of
a
crypto
entrepreneur
the
uncertainty
as
to
which
party
will
control
congress
will
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
probability
of
market
structure
regulation
being
adopted
and
will
therefore
create
significant
financial
risk
for
the
startup
confirmations
beyond
legislation
each
chamber
of
congress
has
specific
power
to
take
independent
action
the
senate
for
instance
holds
the
exclusive
power
to
confirm
presidential
nominees
for
the
judicial
and
executive
branches
therefore
anyone
with
an

taxation
the

notably

passing
any
legislative
fixes

to
these
two
provisions
depends
significantly
on
which
party
controls
that
congress
congressional
control
contracts
would
therefore
provide
a
way
for
affected
crypto
firms
to
hedge
their
exposure
to
the
potential
implementation
of
these
provisions
control
contracts
allow
stakeholders
to
hedge
against
the
aggregate
and
granular
risks
that
flow
from
partisan
control
against
that
backdrop
congressional
control
contracts
offer
the
public
significant
value
in
at
least
two
respects
first
they
allow
stakeholders
to
hedge
against
the
aggregate
risks
that
come
with
one
party
control
of
congress
who
wields
the
powers
of
congress
matters
enormously
across
innumerable
areas
of
public
life
second
control
contracts
permit
hedging
against
specific
policy
outcomes
both
major
political
parties
offer
legislative
agendas
congressional
control
contracts
allow
stakeholders
to
mitigate
the
risks
associated
with
the
implementation
of
those
agendas
writ
large
1
control
contracts
allow
parties
to
hedge
aggregate
risk
when
congressional
power
shifts
from
one
party
to
the
other
the
financial
risks
facing
businesses
and
individuals
shift
too
but
each
specific
risk
may
not
always
be
knowable
beforehand
as
described
above
changes
in
congressional
control
can
create
aggregate
risk
in
a
myriad
of
ways
including
through
legislation
nominations
taxation
and
more
that
is
true
even
when
the
change
in
control
does
not
materially
increase
the
risk
of
any
particular
legislative
outcome
take
for
example
a
venture
capital
firm
that
invests
in
multiple
different
types
of
industries
that
firm
may
be
able
to
mitigate
risk
through
multiple
independent
hedgesfor
example
one
regarding
the
epa
car
emission
standards
and
another
about
the
sec
regulation
of
crypto
but
there
is
no
reason
to
prohibit
that
firm
from
the
one
stopshopping
that
a
congressional
control
contract
offers
such
contracts
give
financial
force
to
the
truism
that
one
congress
or
chamber
that
seeks
to
aggressively
regulate
a
particular
industry
can
use
its
broad
powers
to
undermine
that
industry
in
several
ways
so
too
for
a
congress
that
supports
a
given
industry
because
that
support
may
evaporate
if
congressional
control
changes
hands
trying
to
manage
these
financial
risks
by
anticipating
how
congress
will
exercise
its
specific
powers
is
like
trying
to
buy
homeowner
insurance
based
on
where
a
fire
could
start
there
are
too
many
bases
to
cover
just
like
a
fire
might
start
in
a
kitchen
electrical
closet
or
even
outside
so
too
congress
might
take
adverse
action
through
legislation
confirmations
taxation
and
more
control
contracts
allow
businesses
to
hedge
all
that
risk
using
a
single
instrument
just
like
a
homeowner
buying
a
single
insurance
policy
as
kalshi
discusses
event
contracts
and
insurance
differ
in
important
respects
msj

still
at
a
high
level
both
instruments
allow
the
purchaser
to
address
aggregate
risks
using
a
single
instrument
2
control
contracts
allow
parties
to
hedge
specific
outcomes
congressional
control
contracts
offer
the
additional
advantage
of
hedging
against
more
granular
outcomes
that
become
more
or
less
likely
under
one
particular
political
party
rule
for
example
during
the
2002

control
contracts
give
businesses
in
the
sector
a
tool
to
hedge
the
risks
that
they
may
see
in
specific
congressional
action
related
to
it
is
the
same
for
businesses
in
many
other
sectors
control
contracts
can
also
help
hedge
risks
that
are
independent
of
official
congressional
action
congressional
control
itself
can
also
pose
direct
financial
risks
to
businesses
and
individuals
even
before
considering
what
official
action
congress
might
take
consider
again
a
crypto
focused
startup
that
knows
it
will
need
to
raise
capital
sometime
after
the
next
congressional
election
if
the
party
that
takes
or
keeps
power
seeks
to
aggressively
regulate
the
startup
business
or
the
crypto
sector
in
general
then
the
startup
cost
of
capital
may
increase
the
cost
goes
up
not
because
of
anything
congress
has
done
but
rather
because
capital
markets
view
the
mere
change
in
control
as
a
meaningful
factor
affecting
the
startup
creditworthiness
or
viability
control
contracts
can
help
the
startup
manage
that
risk
ii
event
markets
for
control
contracts
are
an
accurate
and
useful
predictive
tool
event
markets
reveal
collective
wisdom
the
prices
for
control
contracts
reflect
a
wide
array
of
informed
opinions
about
which
political
party
will
control
each
house
of
congress
because
of
that
the
price
itself
represents
the
market
real
time
prediction
about
what
will
happen
in
the
next
election
by
observing

event
markets
give
an
up
to
the
minute
prediction
of
political
outcomes
predictions
are
valuable
only
if
accurate
even
though
they
do
not
offer
predictive
certainty
event
markets
do
have
several
accuracy
enhancing
features
first
event
markets
are
accurate
because
of
their
inherent
ability
to
adjust
to
new
information
in
real
time
as
events
unfold
and
new
data
becomes
available
market
participants
swiftly
incorporate
this
information
into
their
hedging
strategies
this
continuous
flow
of
information
and
the
immediate
response
of
market
actors
ensures
that
prices
of
event
contracts
are
always
reflective
of
the
most
current
understanding
and
expectations
regarding
congressional
control
the
real
time
nature
of
event
markets
separates
them
from
polling
data
which
can
lag
for
days
second
market
participants
have
skin
in
the
game
meaning
that
they
have
a
financial
stake
in
whether
a
particular
event
comes
to
pass
and
are
therefore
highly
motivated
to
try
to
accurately
forecast
event
outcomes
in
contrast
polling
results
are
based
on
the
potentially
uninformed
opinions
of
individuals
selected
at
random
the
vested
interest
of
event
market
participants
leads
to
more
precise
and
reliable
market
pricing
third
event
markets
are
open
to
a
wide
array
of
buyers
and
sellers
each
participant
brings
their
own
unique
preferences
objectives
and
experiences
to
the
table
these
buyers
and
sellers
can
include
hedgers
seeking
to
mitigate
risk
institutional
investors
who
wish
to
diversify
their
portfolios
or
even
speculators
looking
to
profit
from
future
changes
in
contract
prices
that
diversity
ensures
that
the
market
prices
reflect
a
broad
spectrum
of
perspectives
the
interaction
between
these
participants
each
employing
their
own
specific
strategies
and
insights
contributes
to
the
depth
liquidity
and
efficiency
of
the
market
for
event
contracts
which
in
turn
lowers
the
cost
of
hedging
for
many
event
contracts
including
control
contracts
this
holistic
perspective
is
unavailable
anywhere
else
unlike
polling
data
control
contracts
do
not
suffer
from
sample
bias
recency
bias
survey
bias
or
any
of
the
numerous
other
complicated
pitfalls
that
weigh
down
the
accuracy
of
political
polling
they
are
real
time
and
open
to
informed
individual
and
institutional
participants
unlike
polling
which
uses
retrospective
snapshots
in
time
of
sampled
individual
voters

use
the

control
contracts
give
the
public
better
data
about
the
likelihood
of
political
outcomes
that
is
why
harvard

argued
that
a

to
control
congress
would
thus
be
highly
valuable
