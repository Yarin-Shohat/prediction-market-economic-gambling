the

trading
commission
cftc
or
the
commission
proposed
amendments
to
part
40
of
the
cftc
regulations
as
set
forth
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
dated
may
10
2024
the
notice
ln
pertinent
part
the
notice
sets
forth
several
questions
that
relate
to
the
utility
of
contracts
involving
gaming
and
asks
whether
a
blanket
prohibition
of
such
contracts
is
warranted
as
a
longstanding
market
maker
of
exchange
traded
derivative
instruments
we
believe
that
the
types
of
contracts
that
the
notice
now
defines
as
gaming
can
provide
businesses
legitimate
hedging
opportunities
and
that
the
public
interest
would
be
very
much
served
by
allowing
for
a
regulated
market
to
trade
them
upon
therefore
for
the
reasons
set
forth
below
we
strongly
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
position
and
the
proposed
ban
of
all
gaming
contracts
as
an
initial
matter
the
notice
asks
for
public
comments
regarding
the
cftc
newly
proposed
definition
of
gaming
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
while
we
defer
to
the
comments
submitted
by
licensed
sportsbooks
and
legal
experts
as
to
what
should
be
considered
gaming
sig
would
note
that
the
cftc
proposed
definition
appears
to
be
overly
broad
si
g
understanding
of
the
cftc
notes
is
used
interchangeably
with
the
terms
gambling
betting
or
wagering
has
always
been
that
it
involves
an
activity
wherein
a
person
takes
on
financial
risk
wholly
unrelated
to
any
other
business
activity
as
such
if
a
trader
risks
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
in
the
interest
of
hedging
a
legitimate
business
risk
that
trade
should
not
be
prohibited
as
a
de
facto
bet
or
wager
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
the
unrevised
cftc
rule
while
the
notice
concedes
that
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
would
prohibit
some
legitimate
hedging
activity
for
entities
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
outcome
the
notice
downplays
this
inclusion
by
finding
that
these
contracts
generally
can
not
be
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
sig
respectfully
disagrees
with
this
conclusion
for
example
contracts
that
relate
to
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
event
the
winner
of
a
national
football
league
game
could
help
manage
the
financial
risk
and
variance
inherent
to
sports
book
operators
whose
business
is
inextricably
tied
to
predicting
the
outcome
of
certain
games
or
contests
they
can
and
do
face
significant
financial
risk
in
their
operations
if
their
retail
customers
heavily
favor
one
side
of
an
event
in
that
instance
operators
are
forced
to
either
change
the
price
of
the
event
to
an
undesirable
amount
to
discourage
additional
participation
or
to
stop
accepting
wagers
on
the
event
entirely
if
the
cftc
were
to
allow
for
a
regulated
derivative
market
offering
contracts
related
to
the
outcome
of
an
event
however
the
sportsbook
that
has
reached
its
risk
limit
would
be
able
to
hedge
that
risk
to
the
market
at
an
efficient
price
balance
its
books
and
continue
accepting
wagers
from
retail
customers
in
a
regulated
environment
as
legalized
and
regulated
sports
betting
continues
to
grow
in
the
united
states
sportsbooks
looking
for
an
opportunity
to
hedge
legitimate
business
risk
to
a
sophisticated
counterparty
based
upon
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
contest
alone
would
occur
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
even
setting
aside
licensed
sportsbooks
the
notice
concludes
that
the
broader
universe
of
market
participants
are
most
likely
to
trade
such
contract
for
entertainment
purposes
only
this
finding
however
fails
to
appreciate
the
economic
ecosystem
centered
around
american
sports
in
addition
to
sports
books
there
are
myriad
local
businesses
that
have
a
substantial
financial
interests
tied
to
the
outcome
of
these
contests
this
includes
not
just
stadium
and
arena
owners
that
need
to
anticipate
staffing
needs
in
their
venues
but
also
countless
hotels
restaurants
and
other
local
businesses
that
stand
to
generate
a
great
deal
of
revenue
if
their
local
sports
team
qualifies
to
host
additional
playoff
games
or
has
a
particularly
successful
season
even
more
ancillary
businesses
such
as
parking
lot
operators
close
to
stadiums
see
uncertain
spikes
in
revenue
when
attendance
to
local
sporting
events
increase
or
for
each
additional
playoff
game
certainly
when
a
team
is
having
an
exciting
winning
season
more
fans
will
attend
games
and
thereby
frequent
local
establishments
unfortunately
there
is
no
traditional
financial
tool
that
could
allow
these
businesses
to
hedge
the
uncertainty
of
a
team
winning
a
game
or
playoff
series
unlike
a
retail
customer
entities
are
almost
universally
restricted
from
utilizing
a
licensed
sportsbook
to
hedge
this
type
of
risk
if
however
these
contracts
were
made
available
on
a
regulated
market
these
business
owners
like
a
farmer
using
a
listed
future
to
hedge
a
crop
harvest
could
protect
against
the
downswing
in
revenue
if
a
local
team
season
were
to
end
unexpectedly
early
the
above
justification
for
permitting
trading
of
at
least
some
regulated
gaming
contracts
applies
with
even
greater
force
to
those
contracts
based
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
which
the
notice
would
now
expressly
consider
gaming
in
proposed
cftc
rule
while
sig
has
submitted
multiple
comment
letters
addressing
this
exact
issue
filed
as
public
comments
for
industry
filings
22
002
and
230
i
we
would
still
take
this
opportunity
to
reiterate
our
view
that
contracts
regarding
the
outcome
of
political
elections
serve
a
vital
purpose
in
allowing
investors
to
hedge
against
unwanted
risk
created
by
elections
in
a
manner
closely
resembling
commonly
used
financial
products
as
previously
explained
market
participants
already
adjust
their
trading
strategies
in
response
to
electoral
outcomes
as
different
governments
have
substantially
different
policies
while
there
is
some
uncertainty
regarding
the
exact
manifestation
of
specific
policies
election
contracts
allow
a
market
participant
e
and
the
market
as
a
whole
to
forecast
the
implications
associated
with
one
candidate
agenda
and
then
react
to
the
possible
outcome
of
an
election
in
this
manner
the
directional
effect
of
a
given
government
certainly
to
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
price
of
commodities
and
other
financial
assets
or
instruments
for
example
one
candidate
may
be
more
likely
than
another
to
impose
strict
environmental
regulations
that
would
raise
operational
costs
and
associated
prices
in
certain
energy
industries
by
trading
election
outcome
contracts
businesses
could
alleviate
the
risk
of
increased
energy
costs
by
trading
a
contract
with
a
party
more
willing
to
bear
that
risk
moreover
our
experience
over
decades
in
the
financial
industry
suggests
that
traditional
instruments
are
insufficient
to
fully
hedge
the
risks
that
arise
from
these
fluctuations
in
government
policy
many
products
do
not
have
futures
markets
associated
with
them
as
a
result
market
participants
that
face
idiosyncratic
policy
risk
are
forced
to
use
imperfect
exchange
traded
products
that
do
not
fully
reduce
their
unwanted
risk
this
void
in
options
leaves
many
businesses
and
investors
exposed
to
unmitigated
risk
regulated
election
contracts
on
the
other
hand
could
be
used
to
efficiently
hedge
business
risks
in
the
same
manner
as
other
successfully
listed
hedging
products
just
as
a
financial
institution
uses
listed
futures
to
hedge
a
portfolio
of
investment
products
another
business
applying
the
same
general
risk
management
goal
could
hedge
a
candidate
prospective
tax
hike
using
regulated
election
contracts
lastly
the
notice
poses
several
concerns
with
respect
to
election
integrity
specifically
the
notice
speculates
that
permitting
trading
on
these
contracts
could
raise
unique
additional
public
interest
concerns
relating
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
while
many
other
commentators
have
weighed
in
regarding
the
social
significance
of
these
contracts
hedging
utility
and
their
resistance
to
manipulation
sig
would
just
emphasize
that
vast
amounts
of
us
election
related
trading
already
occur
in
the
status
quo
and
to
date
have
not
caused
any
integrity
related
concerns
this
fact
should
not
only
highlight
the
clear
demand
that
exists
for
these
products
but
also
underscore
that
bringing
this
activity
to
the
onshore
regulated
and
taxed
market
could
significantly
alleviate
that
concern
even
if
the
cftc
does
not
wish
to
find
itself
investigating
the
outcome
of
an
election
allowing
for
an
onshore
trading
environment
would
give
those
agencies
that
are
tasked
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
laws
such
as
the
federal
election
commission
more
information
to
do
their
jobs
while
also
providing
market
protection
for
the
many
that
could
avail
themselves
of
these
hedging
tools
in
conclusion
sig
strongly
recommends
that
the
cftc
reconsider
its
position
on
a
prohibition
of
gaming
contracts
there
are
numerous
types
of
contracts
that
would
fall
under
the
cftc
broad
definition
that
could
provide
an
active
competitive
hedging
market
to
the
benefit
of
a
multitude
of
stakeholders
permitting
even
some
of
these
contracts
such
as
those
discussed
above
would
serve
as
an
invaluable
financial
tool
that
even
institutional
investors
may
use
to
balance
otherwise
unchecked
risk
