comment
on
the
cftc
proposed
rule
to
prohibit
election
event
contracts
i
am
writing
to
express
my
deep
concern
and
strong
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
proposed
rule
to
prohibit
election
event
contracts
this
proposal
represents
a
significant
overreach
of
the
cftc
regulatory
authority
and
demonstrates
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
valuable
role
these
markets
play
in
our
financial
ecosystem
and
democratic
process
i
urge
the
commission
to
reject
this
proposal
and
instead
engage
in
a
more
thoughtful
collaborative
approach
with
industry
stakeholders
to
address
any
concerns
while
preserving
the
numerous
benefits
these
markets
provide
regulatory
overreach
and
misinterpretation
of
authority
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
election
event
contracts
goes
far
beyond
its
congressional
mandate
and
represents
a
troubling
expansion
of
regulatory
power
the
commission
attempt
to
classify
these
contracts
as
mere
gaming
ignores
their
legitimate
economic
purpose
and
contradicts
the
cftc
own
previous
positions
on
event
contracts
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
grants
the
cftc
authority
to
regulate
derivatives
markets
to
ensure
their
integrity
and
protect
market
participants
however
it
does
not
give
the
commission
carte
blanche
to
prohibit
entire
classes
of
contracts
that
serve
valid
economic
functions
by
proposing
this
ban
the
cftc
is
effectively
rewriting
its
mandate
without
congressional
approval
setting
a
dangerous
precedent
for
future
regulatory
overreach
the
economic
value
of
election
markets
risk
management
and
hedging
election
outcomes
have
far
reaching
economic
consequences
affecting
everything
from
tax
policy
to
regulatory
environments
across
various
industries
election
event
contracts
provide
a
crucial
tool
for
businesses
and
individuals
to
hedge
against
these
political
risks
for
instance
1
a
renewable
energy
company
might
use
these
contracts
to
hedge
against
the
risk
of
policy
changes
that
could
affect
subsidies
or
regulations
2
an
international
business
could
use
them
to
manage
currency
risk
related
to
potential
trade
policy
shifts
3
investors
could
use
these
contracts
to
protect
their
portfolios
against
market
volatility
associated
with
electoral
uncertainty
by
banning
these
contracts
the
cftc
would
be
eliminating
an
important
risk
management
tool
potentially
increasing
systemic
risk
in
the
financial
system
price
discovery
and
information
aggregation
election
event
markets
serve
a
vital
function
in
aggregating
diverse
information
and
providing
accurate
forecasts
these
markets
have
consistently
outperformed
traditional
polling
methods
in
predicting
electoral
outcomes
the
prices
in
these
markets
reflect
the
collective
wisdom
of
participants
offering
real
time
insights
into
public
sentiment
and
electoral
probabilities
this
information
is
invaluable
not
only
to
market
participants
but
also
to
policymakers
who
rely
on
accurate
forecasts
to
make
informed
decisions
journalists
and
researchers
studying
political
trends
and
public
opinion
the
general
public
seeking
to
understand
the
likely
outcomes
of
democratic
processes
by
prohibiting
these
markets
the
cftc
would
be
removing
a
powerful
tool
for
enhancing
the
transparency
and
efficiency
of
our
democratic
system
the
need
for
stakeholder
engagement
the
cftc
proposal
has
been
met
with
significant
criticism
from
industry
participants
academic
researchers
and
even
some
within
the
commission
itself
this
backlash
underscores
the
need
for
a
more
collaborative
approach
to
regulation
instead
of
imposing
a
unilateral
ban
the
cftc
should
1
engage
in
meaningful
dialogue
with
market
operators
participants
and
academic
experts
to
fully
understand
the
benefits
and
potential
risks
of
election
event
contracts
2
explore
alternative
regulatory
frameworks
that
address
any
legitimate
concerns
while
preserving
the
valuable
functions
of
these
markets
3
consider
the
potential
unintended
consequences
of
a
ban
such
as
driving
trading
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
markets
which
could
pose
greater
risks
to
market
participants
and
reduce
transparency
conclusion
and
call
to
action
the
cftc
proposed
ban
on
election
event
contracts
is
an
unnecessary
and
potentially
harmful
overreach
that
fails
to
recognize
the
significant
economic
and
social
benefits
these
markets
provide
these
contracts
serve
crucial
functions
in
risk
management
price
discovery
and
information
aggregation
enhancing
both
our
financial
markets
and
our
democratic
processes
i
strongly
urge
the
commission
to
1
vote
against
this
misguided
proposal
2
engage
in
a
thorough
transparent
process
of
stakeholder
consultation
3
develop
a
balanced
regulatory
framework
that
preserves
the
benefits
of
election
event
contracts
while
addressing
any
legitimate
concerns
by
taking
this
more
measured
approach
the
cftc
can
fulfill
its
regulatory
mandate
while
fostering
innovation
and
preserving
valuable
market
tools
that
contribute
to
both
economic
stability
and
democratic
transparency
