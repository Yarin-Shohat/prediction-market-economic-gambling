the

elections

not
one
of

that

this

because
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
turn
on
the
outcomes
of
federal
election
sevents
wholly
unrelated
to
illegal
activity
terrorism

war
or

they
do
not
trigger

in
nevertheless
barring
kalshi
from

the

cftc

the
commission
advances
arguments
that
are
if
anything
even
less
coherent
than
those
in
its
order
neither
the
brief
length
nor
its
volume
of
footnotes
can
conceal
its
lack
of
substance
on
the
key
controlling
issues
in
this
case
first
the
commission
fundamentally
misunderstands
what
the
statute
means
when
it
refers
to
event
contracts
that
involve
the
enumerated
activities
the
cftc
acknowledges
that
for
most
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
question
is
whether
the
contract
underlying
event
involves
the
activity
but
for
gaming
and
unlawful
only
for
those
activities
the
commission
insists
the
question
becomes
whether
trading
the
contract
involves
the
activity
those
are
two
totally
different
inquiries
the
commission
identifies
no
other
statute
that
employs
language
in
such
a
shape
shifting
way
using
a
single
term
in
a
single
sentence
to
repeatedly
toggle
back
and
forth
between
two
different
subjects
this
reading
flies
in
the
face
of
basic
interpretive
principles
and
also
upends
the
basic
structure
of
the
scheme
second
the
commission
initial
wrong
turn
forces
it
down
other
blind
alleys
it
claims
that
buying
or
selling
kalshi
contracts
involves
gaming
but
there
is
no
game
here
only
real
world
events
with
real
economic
impacts
nor
can
the
cftc
construe
gaming
broadly
to
mean
all
gambling
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
since
that
would
sweep
in
all
event
contracts
making
nonsense
of
the
statutory
enumeration
the
commission
admits
as
much
attempting
to
steer
between
that
scylla
and
charybdis
it
gerrymanders
a
novel
definition
of
gaming
to
cover
wagers
on
games
or
contests
but
nothing
else
the
commission
can
not
and
does
not
explain
however
why
that
neither
here
nor
there
interpretation
is
the
best
reflection
of
congressional
intent
as
opposed
to
the
best
way
to
ensnare
kalshi
contracts
which
appears
to
be
the
commission
sole
objective
and
the
games
or
contests
construction
fails
even
on
that
score
since
elections
are
plainly
not
contests
under
the
state
gambling
statutes
upon
which
the
commission
rests
the
cftc
attempt
to
condemn
kalshi
contracts
as
involving
unlawful
activity
requires
even
stranger
contortions
it
argues
that
this
category
is
implicated
because
some
states
prohibit
betting
on
elections
but
as
the
order
itself
observed
many
states
ban
all
wagering
on
contingencies
on
the
commission
logic
every
event
contract
thus
involves
unlawful
activity
in
just
the
same
way
as
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
do
despite
some
nearly
unintelligible
denials
the
commission
effectively
admits
as
much
it
thereby
turns
the
statutory
scheme
on
its
head
and
effectively
reinstates
the
across
the
board
pre
clearance
regime
that
congress
repealed
decades
ago
that
can
not
be
right
finally
the
commission
efforts
to
prop
up
the
order
public
interest
finding
fall
flat
it
is
undeniable
that
elections
impact
people
and
businesses
indeed
hardly
any
other
events
matter
as
much
as
elections
do
and
if
elections
matter
the
risks
associated
with
them
can
be
hedged
that
simple
reality
is
more
than
enough
to
align
kalshi
contracts
with
the
public
interest
in
its
brief
the
commission
only
doubles
down
on
the
order
analytical
errors
it
ignores
the
mountains
of
concrete
evidence
of
the
contracts
benefits
while
repeating
irrelevant
platitudes
about
election
integrity
which
kalshi
wholeheartedly
supports
and
elevating
unfounded
bogeyman
claims
that
have
no
basis
in
fact
the
commission
tries
to
hide
behind
the
formality
that
the
order
resulted
from
an
informal
adjudication
but
that
is
no
excuse
for
arbitrary
and
capricious
reasoning
the
cftc
chose
to
ask
for
the
public
input
but
then
ignored
it
when
the
facts
did
not
fit
the
commission
pre
ordained
agenda
of
protecting
wall
street
monopoly
over
risk
hedging
financial
products
in
the
end
it
is
clear
that
this
court
must
vacate
the
order
and
permit
kalshi
to
list
the
congressional
control
contracts
to
the
extent
congress
determines
that
election
contracts
should
be
banned
it
remains
free
to
add
elections
to
the
list
of
enumerated
activities
that
trigger
cftc
review
but
current
law
is
clear
and
the
commission
can
not
twist
or
rewrite
it
to
protect
an
incumbent
hegemony
kalshi
is
therefore
entitled
to
summary
judgment
and
respectfully
reiterates
its
request
for
a
ruling
to
that
effect
in
advance
of
the
next
set
of
federal
elections
argument
the
cftc
is
wrong
about
what
it
means
for
an
event
contract
to
involve
an
enumerated
activity
under
the
only
consistent
coherent
interpretation
of
the
cea
event
contract
provision
kalshi
contracts
involve
neither
gaming
nor
unlawful
activity
at
the
threshold
that
is
because
the
word
involve
read
in
its
statutory
context
links
the
enumerated
activities
to
a
contract
event
to
the
act
of
trading
it
this
event
focused
reading
makes
sense
of
each
enumerated
activity
and
accommodates
the
statute
broader
structure
meanwhile
the
commission
contrary
reading
under
which
involve
refers
to
the
underlying
event
for
some
enumerated
activities
but
to
the
act
of
trading
for
the
gaming
and
unlawful
activity
categories
does
not
fit
no
matter
how
broad
a
single
statutory
term
in
a
single
sentence
can
not
perform
two
completely
different
tasks
simultaneously
and
basic
principles
of
statutory
construction
confirm
that
involve
here
must
refer
to
the
underlying
event
lest
every
event
contract
be
subjected
to
public
interest
scrutiny
even
after
congress
specifically
repealed
that
regime
and
curtailed
the

involve
connects
enumerated
activities
with

not
with

the
commission
never
disputes
that
for
the
terrorism
assassination
and
war
categories
an
event
contract
can
involve
those
activities
only
if
its
underlying
event
relates
to
them
and
the
commission
concedes
that
the

the
term

the

the
commission
never
suggests
that

it
argues
only

the
commission
occasionally
disputes

is
that
activity

not
itself

whether

emphasis
added
the
super
bowl
plainly
does
again
the
dispute
is
not
about
how
closely
an
underlying
event
must
relate
to
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
it
is
about
whether
it
suffices
for
trading
a
contract
to
relate
to
an
enumerated
activity
the
latter
inquiry
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
the
problem
with
the
commission
reading
is
even
starker
when
it
comes
to
unlawful
activity
because
multiple
states
already
ban
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
construing
involve
to
refer
to
the
act
of
trading
would
subject
every
event
contract
to
public
interest
pre
clearance
see
kalshi
br

and
this
time
the
commission
identifies
no
limiting
principle
to
avoid
that
result
see
cftc
br
26
35
36
it
denies
reading
involve
to
mean
that
the
act
of
trading
the
contract
itself
must
be
unlawful
cftc
br
26
but
while
a
state
law
prohibition
on
trading
the
contract
might
not
be
necessary
under
the
commission
reading
the
commission
certainly
treats
such
a
law
as
sufficient
to
trigger
public
interest
scrutiny
see
supra
indeed
that
is
the
only
way
the
commission
can
cram
kalshi
contracts
into
the
unlawful
activity
category
and
on
that
logic
trading
any

would

kalshi
common

reading

by
contrast
avoids

of

under
kalshi
reading
the

authorizes

when
a

involves
relates
to
entails
etc
gaming
or
an

one
of

that

respects
the

works
with
all
of

and
affords
each
category
a
clear
and
appropriately
constrained
sweep
without
swallowing
the
rule
it
is
clearly
the
correct
interpretation
the
cftc
attacks
on
kalshi
reading
fail
unable
to
defend
its
own
reading
of
the
statute
the
commission
goes
after
kalshi
it
starts
by
making
a
textual
argument
that
once
again
mischaracterizes
kalshi
position
and
it
continues
by
claiming
that
kalshi
reading
is
at
odds
with
a
snippet
of
legislative
history
both
gambits
fail
on
the
text
the
commission
points
out
that
earlier
in
the
statute
congress
used
the
phrase
based
upon
in
relation
to
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
cftc
br
23
quoting

gesturing
at
the
meaningful
variation
canon
the
commission
argues
that
congress
must
have
used
involve
to
mean
something
broader
than
based
upon
cftc
br
23
again
however
the
commission
is
attacking
a
straw
man
kalshi
agrees
that
involve
carries
its
typical
meaning
to
relate
to
entail
etc
which
is
broader
than
based
upon
see
supra
5
7
to
use
the
commission
example
a
contract
that
pays
out
based
on
whether
a
certain
amount
of
cocaine
is
seized
by
authorities
might
not
be
based
upon
illegal
activity
since
the
seizure
itself
would
be
legal
the
contract
event
would
still
relate
to
unlawful
activity
cftc
br
26
kalshi
agrees
but
none
of
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
here
which
is
whether
it
is
the
underlying
event
or
the
act
of
trading
that
must
involve
the
activity
for
example
does
an
event
contract
on
the
average
temperature
next
july
involve
unlawful
activity
simply
because
wagering
on
such
an
outcome
would
be
unlawful
gambling
in
some

the
answer
to
that
question
is
surely
no
finding
no
refuge
in

and
nothing
in
the

exchange
supports
the
commission
bizarrely
inconsistent
reading
of
the
statute
ii
the
cftc
reading
of
the
enumerated
activities
is
untenable
even
accepting
the
commission
erroneous
reading
of
involve
kalshi
still
prevails
first
trading
kalshi
contracts
does
not
involve
gaming
because
traders
take
positions
on
elections
not
games
the
commission
attempt
to
expand
gaming
to
cover
wagers
on
nothing
else
has
no
basis
in
law
or
common
sense
and
kalshi
contracts
are
not
covered
by
that
definition
anyway
second
the
act
of
trading
kalshi
contracts
does
not
involve
unlawful
activity
because
federal
law
preempts
state
law
in
this
sphere
the
commission
argument
to
the
extent
it
is
comprehensible
hinges
on
a
reading
of
unlawful
activity
that
subjects
every
event
contract
to
public
interest
review
which
is
obviously
untenable
gaming
requires
a
game
as
kalshi
explained
in
its
opening
brief
gaming
ordinarily
means
playing
games
of
chance
for
money
it
can
also
refer
to
betting
on
games
including
sporting
events
see
kalshi
br
24
25
elections
are
not
games
so
event
contracts
contingent
on
elections
can
not
fairly
be
said
to
involve
gaming
kalshi
br
27
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
meaning
gaming
is
too
narrow
to
encompass
kalshi
contracts
the
order
observed
that
some
dictionaries
connect
gaming
with
gambling
and
then
pointed
to
some
definitions
of
gambling
that
sweep
in
any
and
all
wagers
on
uncertain
contingencies
see
order
at
8
9
but
that
approach
treating
gaming
as
a
catchall
for
anything
colloquially
described
as
gambling
or
sweep
every
event
contract
into
this
category
see
kalshi
br
20
27
28
and
it
hard
to
imagine
a
less
reasonable
construction
of
a
single
exception
on
an
enumerated
list
than
one
that
consumes
each
of
its
neighbors
and
the
general
rule
to
boot
see
supra
8
11
this
interpretation
is
too
broad
to
serve
the
commission
objectives
accordingly
the
cftc
devises
a
made
for
litigation
goldilocks
definition
just
broad
enough
to
reach
kalshi
contracts
but
just
narrow
enough
not
to
swallow
the
rule
on
its
view
gaming
reaches
everything
covered
by
kalshi
reading
betting
on
games
plus
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
nothing
else
cftc
br
29
to
get
there
the
commission
takes
three
leaps
1
gaming
means
gambling
2
gambling
means
wagering
on
games
or
contests
and
3
elections
are
contests
each
step
transgresses
basic
principles
of
statutory
interpretation
first
gaming
is
not
the
same
as
gambling
dictionary
definitions
and
common
usage
alike
confirm
that
gaming
unlike

a
form
of

is
why

cross

cftc

but
the
converse
is
not
true
not
all

congress
chose
the
narrower
term
the

has
no
response
to
the
many
state
statutes
confirming
the
ordinary
game
based
reading
of

and
it
abandons

misguided

the

does
attempt
to
explain
away
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act

which
defines

by
reference
to

25
the
cftc
responds
by
pointing
out
that
igra
does
so
only
for
two
categories
of
gaming
but
then
includes
a
catchall
category
lacking
that
limitation
cftc

32
but
that
supposed
catchall
is

25
that
regulatory
definition
exemplifies
the
conventional
game
based
reading
of
gaming
that
congress
clearly
meant
to
invoke
in
the
cea
it
well
proves
kalshi
point
second
conflating
gaming
with
gambling
only
walks
the
commission
into
another
problem
the
ordinary
definition
of
gambling
is
too
broad
to
fit
here
since
it
would
capture
all
contingent
events
cftc
br
27
the
commission
is
thus
forced
to
gerrymander
a
limited
definition
of
gambling
to
cover
wagers
on
games
or
contests
no
other
bets
that
limit
is
artificial
and
unpersuasive
there
are

again
that

is
untenable
in

since
it
would
turn

supra
14
that
is
why
even
the
commission
disclaims
the
broader
definition
cftc
br
27
28
amp
declaring
that
the
commission
did
not
adopt
the
broad
definition
found
in

that
leaves
just
eight
state
gambling
laws
that
encompass

not
all

even
those

the

a
way
that

excludes

infra

but
setting
that
aside
the
question
remains
why
is
this
narrow
outlier
definition
of

the
best
understanding
of
what
congress
intended
by
gaming
in
the
cea
notably
many
of
the

with

of

similar

define

more
narrowly

that
is
backwards
the

the

rejects
it
there
is
no

to
believe
that
congress

to
be
that

if

every

equally
involves

all

acquiring
