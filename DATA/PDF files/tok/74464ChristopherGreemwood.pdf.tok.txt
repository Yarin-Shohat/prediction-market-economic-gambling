we
are
professors
and
academic
researchers
from
a
variety
of
disciplines
from
economics
to
political
science
to
law
we
are
writing
in
support
of
legalizing
the
use
of
prediction
markets
for
electoral
outcomes
not
just
for
kalshi
but
for
all
other
designated
contract
markets
dcm
under
the
supervision
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
we
believe
these
markets
are
squarely
in
the
public
interest
and
reject
claims
that
they
constitute
gambling
or
may
threaten
the
integrity
of
our
democratic
process
election
prediction
markets
are
a
powerful
resource
for
researchers
researchers
have
been
using
the
data
generated
by
existing
markets
such
as
the
iowa
election
market
iem
and
predictit
for
over
fifteen
years
see
for
example
party
influence
in
congress
and
the
economy
from
erik
snowberg
justin
wolfers
and
eric
zitzewitz
much
of
this
research
falls
into
two
camps
first
some
researchers
use
prediction
market
probabilities
to
estimate
the
effect
of
the
election
on
various
economic
variables
second
other
researchers
use
prediction
market
probabilities
to
learn
what
events
actually
influence
campaigns
a
legalized
market
with
greater
liquidity
and
participation
numbers
should
allow
these
efforts
to
expand
even
further
as
such
these
contracts
serve
the
public
interest
the
cftc
solicited
public
comment
on
the
price
basing
utility
of
election
contracts
in
our
experience
observing
the
market
financial
market
participants
routinely
use
the
probability
of
various
parties
controlling
congress
and
the
presidency
to
accurately
price
various
assets
an
accurate
valuation
of
many
investments
assets
physical
commodities
and
the
value
of
services
requires
an
accurate
assessment
of
the
future
trajectory
of
the
political
environment
the
political
environment
has
significant
and
predictable
impacts
on
business
and
it
is
a
significant
factor
that
affects
valuations
a
fully
approved
market
without
the
limitations
on
existing
unregulated
markets
will
provide
even
better
data
that
not
only
can
be
used
for
pricing
financial
assets
physical
commodities
and
services
but
no
doubt
will
furthermore
election
contracts
have
bona
fide
hedging
utility
companies
already
hedge
electoral
risk
demonstrating
that
this
demand
is
real
and
large
however
these
hedges
are
often
indirect
since
there
are
no
election
based
event
contracts
and
their
pricing
is
not
as
accurate
as
an
event
contract
on
the
elections
would
be
the
cftc
requested
a
number
of
comments
regarding
the
likelihood
that
the
contract
will
be
used
by
retail
traders
such
as
individuals
families
and
small
businesses
for
hedging
see
questions

there
may
be
many
assumptions
underlying
this
line
of
questioning
including
a
doubt
as
to
whether
elections
actually
impact
individuals
families
and
small
businesses
in
a
predictable
way
and
whether
they
are
sophisticated
enough
to
manage
risk
the
answer
is
yes
hedging
is
a
form
of
risk
management
individuals
families
and
small
businesses
all
are
exposed
to
myriad
events
that
will
have
economic
impact
if
they
occur
elections
make
many
of
these
events
more
or
less
likely
to
occur
that
change
in
likelihood
is
a
direct
change
in
the
risk
exposure
that
these
individuals
families
and
small
businesses
face
that
change
to
risk
is
direct
predictable
and
no
less
real
because
it
is
faced
by
a
retail
participant
as
opposed
to
a
big
bank
additionally
the
cftc
should
continue
to
allow
all
participants
including
retail
participants
to
make
their
own
risk
assessments
and
determine
how
best
and
in
what
amounts
risk
should
be
managed
the
cftc
also
asked
for
comments
on
whether
exchanges
should
have
to
prove
an
existing
market
demand
for
hedging
before
listing
a
new
product
as
made
clear
above
there
is
a
demonstrated
market
for
hedging
this
product
and
to
be
clear
this
product
would
pass
the
test
implied
by
questions
7
10
however
the
cftc
should
refrain
from
adopting
any
of
the
tests
implied
in
these
questions
as
they
are
overbroad
and
will
have
a
negative
impact
on
innovation
the
line
of
questioning
is
the
kind
that
is
indicative
of
the
type
of
government
overreach
that
generally
stifles
innovation
if
the
cftc
would
force
an
exchange
to
prove
that
there
is
an
existing
demand
for
hedging
the
cftc
risks
preventing
innovation
and
significantly
stunting
the
growth
and
development
of
event
contract
markets
and
other
futures
and
derivative
markets
additionally
the
cftc
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
market
participants
own
assessment
of
their
risks
and
how
best
to
manage
their
risk
additionally
the
cftc
asked
about
position
limits
the
proposed
position
limits
are
correlated
conservatively
to
individuals
and
small
businesses
it
could
be
higher
however
that
does
not
impact
whether
the
product
is
likely
to
be
used
for
hedging
indeed
the
lower
position
limits
are
important
to
responsible
innovation
to
the
extent
that
there
are
speculative
questions
about
the
impact
of
election
markets
on
election
integrity
it
makes
sense
to
set
position
limits
low
initially
and
gather
data
if
the
data
demonstrates
that
the
concerns
that
the
contracts
will
harm
election
integrity
are
unfounded
the
position
limits
can
be
expanded
the
cftc
should
encourage
these
types
of
measures
as
they
are
indicative
of
responsible
innovation
a
common
theme
of
the
cftc
questions
is
in
regard
to
whether
election
prediction
markets
constitute
gaming
they
do
not
an
election
prediction
market
is
no
more
gaming
than
traditional
financial
markets
including
commodity
futures
and
derivatives
markets
due
to
the
vast
economic
utility
of
the
contracts
while
it
is
true
that
a
portion
of
market
participants
may
speculate
this
is
fully
consistent
with
normal
market
functioning
many
participants
in
energy
or
agricultural
markets
are
speculators
yet
their
presence
does
not
refute
the
economic
utility
of
those
contracts
if
anything
these
speculators
serve
an
important
role
by
providing
liquidity
and
rapid
price
discovery
considering
the
vast
hedging
and
price
basing
value
of
these
contracts
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
consider
these
gaming
in
addition
these
markets
are
resilient
against
manipulation
in
academic
studies
of
manipulation
on
existing
prediction
markets
price
pump
attempts
were
short
lived
and
the
combination
of
greater
liquidity
and
number
of
participants
makes
such
a
phenomenon
substantially
less
likely
on
a
well
regulated
market
for
a
historical
analysis

in
addition
the
relatively
low
position
limit
means
any
one
participant
even
maxing
out
their
total
position
is
highly
unlikely
to
be
able
to
move
the
market
in
a
meaningful
way
for
any
meaningful
period
of
time
as
sophisticated
traders
enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
to
profit
off
of
the
mispricing
manipulation
of
the
election
itself
seems
even
less
likely
the
argument
would
be
that
if
someone
now
has
a
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
over
400
elections
they
may
either
change
their
own
vote
or
attempt
to
change
the
vote
of
others
this
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
people
already
have
a
significant
amount
at
stake
in
elections
additionally
these
fears
are
unfounded
speculation
and
ignore
the
empirical
fact
that
direct
election
trading
exists
in
many
other
countries
such
as
the
without
such
documented
ill
effects
moreover
the
contract
has
been
designed
to
prevent
that
from
happening
by
imposing
know
your
customer
authorization
cftc
oversight
and
a
modest
position
limit
changing
the
outcome
of
any
election
by
even
an
infinitesimal
amount
let
alone
altering
a
national
election
or
the
totality
of
all
the
congressional
elections
would
be
far
more
costly
than
the
proposed
position
limits
this
would
be
true
even
with
position
limits
ten
times
larger
while
it
is
worth
considering
a
trading
prohibition
on
people
who
have
a
unique
insider
status
members
of
congress
their
chiefs
of
staff
people
working
in
state
boards
of
election
etc
this
objection
should
not
be
grounds
for
rejection
of
this
valuable
social
activity
if
these
markets
have
any
impact
on
the
electoral
process
at
all
it
would
be
a
positive
impact
polling
error
has
increased
in
recent
years
polarization
is
at
an
all
time
high
fake
news
is
rampant
a
market
based
mechanism
for
forecasting
the
outcome
of
the
midterms
would
be
a
vastly
superior
alternative
to
polling
and
punditry
and
would
thus
foster
a
healthier
and
more
reasonable
debate
around
the
electoral
process
combating
fake
news
and
providing
a
better
mechanism
for
truth
makes
the
proposed
contracts
very
much
so
in
the
public
interest
ultimately
these
are
economically
valuable
markets
not
gaming
markets
that
promote
the
public
interest
through
superior
forecasting
the
commission
should
embrace
this
valuable
activity
by
bringing
it
under
its
regulatory
umbrella
