was
to

explained
that

that

the

a

not

reflect

an

as

resolve
the

many
or
perhaps
most
statutory

be
unintentional
and
when

confront

in
cases
that
do
not
involve

interpretations
or
delegations
of
authority
they
are
not
somehow
relieved
of
their
obligation
to
independently
interpret
the

instead
of
declaring
a
particular
party
reading
permissible
in
such
a
case
courts
use
every
tool
at
their
disposal
to
determine
the
best
reading
of

resolve
the

in

it
therefore

the
one
the

after

most
fundamentally

has
been
left

this

will
be
respected

after

to
the

that
a

the
court
evidently
perceived
no
basis
for
deference
to
the
agency
with
respect
to
that
pure
legal
question
and
in

the

proclaimed

rule
it
merely
thought
that
a
different
approach
should
apply
where
application
of
a
statutory

was
sufficiently
intertwined
with
the

the

was
far
from
consistent

to
answer

of

the
court
articulated
and
employed
a
now
familiar
two
step
approach
broadly
applicable
to
review
of
agency
action
the
first
step
was
to
discern
whether
congress
directly
spoken
to
the
precise
question
at
issue
at
842
the
court
explained
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
ibid
and
courts
were
therefore
to
reject
administrative
constructions
which
are
contrary
to
clear
congressional
intent
i
at
843
9
to
discern
such
intent
the
court
noted
a
reviewing
court
was
to
employ
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction
ibid
without
mentioning
the
apa
or
acknowledging
any
doctrinal
shift
the
court
articulated
a
second
step
applicable
when
congress
not
directly
addressed
the
precise
question
at
issue
at
843
in
such
a
case
that
is
a
case
in
which
the
statute
was
silent
or
ambiguous
with
respect
to
the
specific
issue
at
hand
reviewing
court
could
not
simply
impose
its
own
construction
on
the
statute
as
would
be
necessary
in
the
absence
of
an
administrative
interpretation

a
court
instead
had
to
set
aside
the
traditional

tools

it

construction

the

initially
had
arisen
in

11
that
directive
was
justified
according
to
the
court
by
the
understanding
that
administering
statutes
requires
the
formulation
of
policy
to
fill
statutory
by
the
long
judicial
tradition
of
according

weight

interpretations

test
the
court
concluded
that
congress
had
not
addressed
the
question
at
issue
with
the
necessary
level
of
specificity
and
that
epa
interpretation
was
entitled
to
deference
at
865
it
did
not
matter
why
congress
as
the
court
saw
it
had
not
squarely
addressed
the
question

ibid
or
that
the
agency
from
time
to
time
changed
its
interpretation

for
those
reasons
delegating

is
simply
not
necessary
to
ensure
that
the
resolution
of
statutory
ambiguities
is

informed

the
better
presumption
is
therefore
that
congress
expects

do
their

of
interpreting

with
due
respect
for
the

of

that

with
how
the

have
performed

in

they
are
of

always
free
to
act

it
is

how
much
the

actually
promotes
such
uniformity
in
any
event
there
is
little
value
in
imposing
a
uniform
interpretation
of
a

if
that
interpretation
is
wrong
we
see
no
reason
to
presume
that
congress
prefers
uniformity
for
uniformity
sake
over
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
laws
it
enacts
the
view
that
interpretation
of
ambiguous
statutory
provisions
amounts
to
policymaking
suited
for
political

rather
than

is
especially
mistaken
for
it
rests
on
a
profound
misconception
of
the

it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
intends
to
leave

to
political

but
resolution
of
statutory

involves
legal

that
is
no

at
all
once
more
the
basic
nature
and
meaning
of
a
statute
does
not
change
when
an
agency
happens
to
be
involved
nor
does
it
change
just
because
the
agency
has
happened
to
offer
its
interpretation
through
the
sort
of
procedures
necessary
to
obtain
deference
or
because
the
other
preconditions
for
chevron
happen
to
be
satisfied
the
statute
still
has
a
best
meaning
necessarily
discernible
by
a
court
deploying
its
full
interpretive
toolkit
so
for
the
dissent
test
to
have
any
meaning
it
must
think
that
in
an
agency
case
unlike
in
any
other
a
court
should
give
up
on
its
interpretive
work
before
it
has
identified
that
best
meaning
but
how
does
a
court
know
when
to
do
so
on
that
point
the
dissent
leaves
a
gap
of
its
own
it
protests
only
that
some

all
with

more
robust
than
chevron

all

identify
the

allow

this
is
all

identify

reveals

the

the

chevron

post

is
hardly
surprising
that

might

much
chevron

so
when

get
there
they

nothing

the

given
our
constant
tinkering
with
and
eventual
turn
away
from
chevron
and
its
inconsistent
application
by
the
lower
courts
it
instead
is
hard
to
see
how
anyone
congress
included
could
reasonably
expect
a
court
to
rely
on
chevron
in
any
particular
case
and
even
if
it
were
possible
to
predict
accurately
when
courts
will
apply
chevron
the
doctrine
does
not
provide
a
clear
or
easily
applicable
standard
so
arguments
for
reliance
based
on
its
clarity
are
misplaced

to
plan
on
chevron
yielding
a
particular
result
is
to
gamble
not
only
that
the
doctrine
will
be
invoked
but
also
that
it
will
produce
readily
foreseeable
outcomes
and
the
stability
that
comes
with
them
history
has
proved
neither
bet
to
be
a
winning
proposition
rather
than
safeguarding
reliance
interests
chevron
affirmatively
destroys
them
under
chevron
a
statutory
ambiguity
no
matter
why
it
is
there
becomes
a
license
authorizing
an
agency
to
change
positions
as
much
as
it
likes
with
inconsistency
being
at
most
a
reason
for
holding
an
interpretation
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
brand

but
statutory
ambiguity
as
we
have
explained
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
actual
delegation
of
discretionary
authority
to
agencies
chevron
thus
allows
agencies
to
change
course
even
when
congress
has
given
them
no
power
to
do
so
by
its
sheer
breadth
chevron
fosters
unwarranted
instability
in
the
law
leaving
those
attempting
to
plan
around
agency
action
in
an
eternal
fog
of
uncertainty
chevron
accordingly
has
undermined

those

enact

and
one
of

the

bars
judges
from
disregarding
that
responsibility
just
because
an
executive
branch
agency
views
a
statute
differently
chevron
is
overruled
courts
must
exercise
their
independent
judgment
in
deciding
whether
an

has
acted
within
its
statutory
authority
as
the
apa
requires
careful
attention
to
the
judgment
of
the
executive
branch
may
help
inform
that
inquiry
and
when
a
particular
statute
delegates
authority
to
an
agency
consistent
with
constitutional
limits
courts
must
respect
the
delegation
while
ensuring
that
the
agency
acts
within
it
but
courts
need
not
and
under
the
apa
may
not
defer
to
an
agency
interpretation
of
the
law
simply
because
a
statute
is
ambiguous
because
the

relied

lincoln
speech
401
but
like
english
judges
before
us
we
have
long
turned
to
familiar
considerations
to
guide
our
assessment
of
the
weight
due
a
past
decision
so
for
example
as
this
court
has
put
it
the
weight
due
a
precedent
may
depend
on
the
quality
of
its
reasoning
its
consistency
with
related
decisions
its
workability
and
reliance
interests
that
have
formed
around
it
see
ramos
590
at
106
the
first
factor
recognizes
that
the
primary
power
of
any
precedent
lies
in
its
power
to
persuade
and
poorly
reasoned
decisions
may
not
provide
reliable
evidence
of
the
law
meaning
the
second
factor
reflects
the
fact
that
a
precedent
is
more
likely
to
be
correct
and
worthy
of
respect
when
it
reflects
the
time
tested
wisdom
of
generations
than
when
it
sits
unmoored
from
surrounding
law
ibid
the
remaining
factors
like
workability
and
reliance
do
not
often
supply
reason
enough
on
their
own
to
abide
a
flawed
decision
for
almost
any
past
decision
is
likely
to
benefit
some
group
eager
to
keep
things
as
they
are
and
content
with
how
things
work
see
i
d
at
108
but
these
factors
can
sometimes
serve
functions
similar
to
the
others
by
pointing
to
clues
that
may
suggest
a
past
decision
is

for

it
seeks
to
serve
instead
as
a
reminder
of
a
more
substantive
lesson
the
lesson
that
in
assessing
the
weight
due
a
past
decision
a
judge
is
not
to
be
guided
by
his
own
impression
alone
but
must
self
consciously
test
his
views
against
those
who
have
come
before
open
to
the
possibility
that
a
precedent
might
be
correct
in
ways
not
initially
apparent
to
him
third
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
read
judicial
opinions
like
statutes
adopted
through
a
robust
and
democratic
process
statutes
often
apply
in
all
their
particulars
to
all
persons
by
contrast
when
judges
reach
a
decision
in
our
adversarial
system
they
render
a
judgment
based
only
on
the
factual
record
and
legal
arguments
the
parties
at
hand
have
chosen
to
develop
a
later
court
assessing
a
past
decision
must
therefore
appreciate
the
possibility
that
different
facts
and
different
legal
arguments
may
dictate
a
different
outcome
they
must
appreciate
too
that
like
anyone
else
judges
are
innately
digressive
and
their
opinions
may
sometimes
offer
stray
asides
about
a
wider
topic

the
answer
for

eliding

is
not
deference
to

that

seek
to
do

a
demand
that

another

when

of

allocating

under

a

interpretive

to
determine
whether
congress
has
spoken
to
an
issue
if
the
court
finds
congress

congress
has
left
an
ambiguity
or
gap
then
a
choice
must
be
made
who
should
give
content
to
a
statute
when
congress
instructions
have
run
out
should
it
be
a
court
or
should
it
be
the
agency
congress
has
charged
with
administering
the
statute
the
answer
chevron
gives
is
that
it
should
usually
be
the
agency
within
the
bounds
of
reasonableness
that
rule
has
formed
the
backdrop
against
which
congress
courts
and
agencies
as
well
as
regulated
parties
and
the
public
all
have
operated
for
decades
it
has
been
applied
in
thousands
of
judicial
decisions
it
has
become
part
of
the
warp
and
woof
of
modern
government

efforts

kinds

a
few
keeping
air

and
the
rule
is
right
this
court
has
long
understood
chevron
deference
to
reflect
what
congress
would
want
and
so
to
be
rooted
in
a
presumption
of
legislative
intent
congress
knows
that
it
does
not
in
fact
cannot
write
perfectly
complete
regulatory
statutes
it
knows
that
those
statutes
will
inevitably
contain
ambiguities
that
some
other
actor
will
have
to
resolve
and
gaps
that
some
other
actor
will
have
to
fill
and
it
would
usually
prefer
that
actor
to
be
the
responsible
agency
not
a
court
some
interpretive
issues
arising
in
the
regulatory
context
involve
scientific
or
technical
subject
matter
agencies
have
expertise
in
those
areas
courts
do
not
some
demand
a
detailed
understanding
of
complex
and
interdependent
regulatory
programs
agencies
know
those
programs
inside
out
again
courts
do
not
and
some
present
policy
choices
including
trade
offs
between
competing
goods
agencies
report
to
a
president
who
in
turn
answers
to
the
public
for
his
policy
calls
courts
have
no
such
accountability
and
no
proper
basis
for
making
policy
and
of
course
congress
has
conferred
on
that
expert
experienced
and
politically
accountable
agency
the
authority
to
administer
to
make
rules
about
and
otherwise
implement
the
statute
giving
rise
to
the
ambiguity
or
gap
put
all
that
together
and
deference
to
the
agency
is
the
almost
obvious
choice
based
on
an
implicit
congressional
delegation
of
interpretive
authority
we
defer
the
court
has
explained
because
of
a
presumption
that
congress
would
have
desired
the
agency
rather
than
the
courts
to
exercise
whatever
degree
of
discretion

consciously
desired

aspects

that
regulatory
experts
would
be
in
a
better
position
than

to
do
so
chevron

or
perhaps
congress
was
unable
to
forge
a
coalition
on
either
side
of

the
contending
parties
decided
to
take
their
chances
with

sometimes
though
the
gaps
or
ambiguities
are
what
might
be
thought
of
as

they
may
be
the
result

that

of
this
kind
are

responds
to

congressional
lack

by
adopting
a
presumption
about
what
congress
wants
rather
than
trying

ambiguities

gaps
absent
a

it

that

the

a

idea
is
that

the

is
that

not

instead
have
insisted
on

so
the

proceed
from
the

place
as
the
original
doctrine
taken
together
they
give
interpretive
primacy
to
the
agency
when
but
only
when
it
is
acting
as
congress
specified
in
the
heartland
of
its

that

framework
reflects

pauley
501

where
congress

congress
has
spoken
only
its

matter
and
courts
alone
determine
when
that
has
happened
using
all
their
normal
interpretive
tools
they
decide
whether
congress
has
addressed
a
given
issue
but
when
courts
have
decided
that
congress
has
not
done
so
a
choice
arises
absent
a
legislative
directive
either
the
administering
agency
or
a
court
must
take
the
lead
and
the
matter
is
more
fit
for
the

the

to
involve

and
to
involve

choices
including

so
a

without

calls
appropriately
steps
back
the

has

and
it
is
the
one
best

ensure
that

statutes
work
in
the
way
congress
intended
the

makes
two
points
in
reply
neither
convincing
first
it
insists
that
agencies
have
no
special
competence
in
filling
gaps
or
resolving
ambiguities
in
regulatory
statutes
rather
do
ante
at
23
score
one
for
self
confidence
maybe
not
so
high
for
self
reflection
or
of
course
courts
often
construe
legal
texts
hopefully
well
and
chevron
first
step
takes
full
advantage
of
that
talent
there
a
court
tries
to
divine
what
congress
meant
even
in
the
most
complicated
or
abstruse
statutory
schemes
the
deference
comes
in
only
if
the
court
can
not
do
so
if
the
court
must
admit
that
standard
legal
tools
will
not
avail
to
fill
a
statutory
silence
or
give
content
to
an
ambiguous
term
that
is
when
the
issues
look
like
the
ones
i

should
one
choose
the
one
more
protective
of

or
the

more
favorable

the
idea
that
courts
have
special
competence
in
deciding
such
questions
whereas
agencies
have
is
if
i
may
say
malarkey
answering
those
questions
right
does
not
mainly
demand
the
interpretive
skills
courts
possess
instead
it
demands
one
or
more
of
subject
matter
expertise
long
engagement
with
a
regulatory
scheme
and
policy
choice
it
is
courts
not
agencies
that
have
no
special
even
legitimacy
when
those
are
the
things
a
decision
calls
for
second
the
majority

that
an
ambiguity
or
gap
does
not
necessarily
reflect
a
congressional
intent
that
an
agency
should
have
primary
interpretive
authority
ante
at
22
on
that
score
i
agree
with
the
premise
it
does
necessarily
do
so
chevron
is
built
on
a
presumption
the
decision
does
not
maintain
that
congress
in
every
case
wants
the
agency
rather
than
a
court
to
fill
in
gaps
the
decision
maintains
that
when
congress
does
not
expressly
pick
one
or
the
other
we
need
a
default
rule
and
the
best
default
rule
agency
or
the
one
we
think
congress
would
generally
want
as
to
why
congress
would
generally
want
the
agency
the
answer
lies
in
everything
said
above
about
congress
delegation
of
regulatory
power
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
special
competencies
see
supra
at

the
majority
appears
to
think
it
is
a
showstopping
rejoinder
to
note
that
many
statutory
gaps
and
ambiguities
are
unintentional
ante
at
22
but
to
begin
many
are
not
the
ratio
between
the
two
is
uncertain
see
supra
at
4
5
and
to
end
why
should
that
matter
in
any
event
congress
may
not
have
deliberately
introduced
a
gap
or
ambiguity
into
the
statute
but
it
knows
that
pretty
much
everything
it
drafts
will
someday
be
found
to
contain
such
a
flaw
given
that
knowledge
chevron
asks
what
would
congress
want
the
presumed
answer
is
again
the
same
for
the
same
reasons
the
agency
and
as
with
any
default
rule
if
congress
decides
otherwise
all
it
need
do
is
say
in
that
respect
the
proof
really
is
in
the
pudding
congress
basically
never
says
otherwise
suggesting
that
chevron
chose
the
presumption
aligning
with
legislative
intent
or
in
the
majority
words
reality
ante
at
22
over
the
last
four
decades
congress
has
authorized
or
reauthorized
hundreds
of
statutes
the

he

he
also
stated
that

there

is

as

the

did

never
indicated

rejected

indeed
not

much
as

to

the
practice
then
was
more
inconsistent
and
less
fully
elaborated
than
it
later
became
the
point
here
is
only
that
the
court
came
nowhere
close
to
accepting
the

of

take
the
language
from

706

in

to
suggest
that

could
not
defer
to

see
sunstein
1656
the
majority
view
of
section
706
likewise
gets
no
support
from
how
judicial
review
operated
in
the
years
leading
up
to
the
apa
that
prior
history
matters
as
the

recognizes
section

was
generally
understood

restate

unlike

a

if

then
it

would
seem
that
the

the

has
no

around

appears
to
distinguish
between

and
the
so

the
application
of
a
legal
standard
to
a
set
of
facts

at

if
in
drawing
that
distinction
the
majority
intends
to
confine
its
holding
to
the
pure
type
of
legal
issue
thus
enabling
courts
to
defer
when

and

are
entwined
be
glad
but
i
suspect
the

has
no
such
intent
because

administrative
application
of

is
administrative
formulation
of
law
whenever
it
involves
elaboration
of
the
statutory
norm
how
does
a
statutory
interpreter
decide
as
in
hearst
what
an
employee
is
in
large
part
through
cases
asking
whether
the
term
covers
people
performing
specific
jobs
like
in
that
case
newsboys
322
at
120
or
consider
one
of
the
examples
i
offered
above
how
does
an
interpreter
decide
when
one
population
segment
of
a
species
is
distinct
from
another
often
by
considering
that
requirement
with
respect
to
particular
species

western

squirrels
so
the
distinction
the
majority
offers
makes
no
real

or
even
theoretical
sense
if
the
hearst
court
was
deferring
to
an
agency
on
whether
the

covered

it
was

agrees
that

and
even

that

can
not

otherwise
said
if
section

perhaps
above

stare

is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
modesty
at

in
that
it
shares
something
important
with
chevron
both
tell
judges
that
they
do
not
know
everything
and
would
do
well
to
attend
to
the
views
of
others
so
today
the
majority
rejects
what
judicial
humility
counsels
not
just
once
but
twice
over
and
chevron
is
entitled
to
a
particularly
strong
form
of
stare

for
two
separate
reasons

it

that

or
to
put
the
point
more
affirmatively
congress
has
kept
chevron
as
is
for
40
years
it
maintained
that
position
even
as
members
of
this
court
began
to
call
chevron
into
question
see

from
all
it
appears
congress
has
not
agreed
with
the
view
of
some

that
they

other

should
have
more
power
second
chevron
is
by
now
much
more
than
a

acting

more
to
the

the

is
a
bootstrap
this

has
avoided
deferring

since

at

because

my

the

does
no
better
in
its
main
justification
for
overruling
chevron
the
decision
is
unworkable
ante
at
30
the
majority
first
theory
on
that
score
is
that
there
is
no
single
answer
about
what
ambiguity
means
some
judges
turn
out
to
see
more
of
it
than
others
do
leading
to
different
results
ante
at
30
31
but
even
if
so
the
legal
system
has
for
many
years
in
many
contexts
dealt
perfectly
well
with
that
variation
take
contract
law
it
is
hornbook
stuff
that
when
but
only
when
a
contract
is
ambiguous
a
court
interpreting
it
can
consult
extrinsic
evidence
see
cnh
industrial
reese
583
133
139
2018
per

and
when
all
interpretive
tools
still
leave
ambiguity
the
contract
is
construed
against
the
drafter
see

so
i
guess
the
contract
rules
of
the
50
states
are
unworkable
now
or
look
closer
to
home
to
doctrines
this
court
regularly
applies
in
deciding
whether
a

has
waived

construe

somehow
everyone
seems
to
get
by

is
an
especially
puzzling
decision
to
criticize
on
the
ground
of
generating
too
much
judicial
divergence

a

effect
of

would
be
to
ensure
a
far
greater
role
for
judicial
policy
preferences
in
statutory
interpretation
and
far
more
common
splits
along

lines
so
if
consistency
among

then
the

should
not
overrule

it

the

so
the

says
are
difficult

to
apply

recall
that
courts
are
not
supposed
to
defer
when
the
agency
construing
a
statute
1
has
not
been
charged
with
administering
that
law
2
has
not
used
deliberative
notice

significance
see

ante
at

as
i
explained
those
exceptions
the
majority
also
aptly
calls
them
with

rationale
they
define
circumstances
in
which
congress
is
unlikely
to
have
wanted
agency
views
to
govern

and
on
the

they
are
nothing

has
congress
put
the

the
statute
in
99
of
100
cases
everyone
will
agree
on
the
answer
with
scarcely
a
moment
thought
did
the
agency
use
notice

or
an
adjudication
before
rendering
an
interpretation
once
again
i
could
stretch
my
mind
and

up

for
the
most

the
answer
is
an
easy
yes

no

the

congress
in

delegates

that

one
reason
justice

was
that
it
replaced

congress

alike
have
relied

chevron
assumed
its
existence
in
much
of
their
work
for
the
last
40
years
statutes
passed
during
that
time
reflect
the
expectation
that
chevron
would
allocate
interpretive
authority
between
agencies
and
courts
rules
issued
during
the
period
likewise
presuppose
that
statutory
ambiguities
were
the
agencies
to
reasonably
resolve

may
have
benefited

they
may

this

refused

overruling

thus
raising
new
doubts
about
agency

of

will
be
far
more
disruptive
the
majority
tries
to
alleviate
concerns
about
a
piece
of
that
problem
it
states
that
judicial
decisions
that
have
upheld
agency
action
as
reasonable
under

should
not
be
overruled
on
that
account
alone

that

there

first
reasonable

the

a

say
the

congress

agencies
the
better

fill
the

in

because

there

congress

it
is
a

this

has
now
claimed

as

and
that
claim
requires
disrespecting
too
this

precedent
there
are
no
special
reasons
of
the
kind
usually
invoked
for
overturning

to
eliminate
chevron
deference
and
given
chevron
pervasiveness
the
decision
to
do
so
is
likely
to
produce
large
scale
disruption
all
that
backs
today
decision
is
the
majority
belief
that
chevron
was
wrong
that
it
gave
agencies
too
much
power
and
courts
not
enough
but
shifting
views
about
the
worth
of
regulatory
actors
and
their
work
do
not
justify
overhauling
a
cornerstone
of
administrative
law
in
that
sense
too
today
majority
has
lost
sight
of
its
proper
role
and
it
is
impossible
to
pretend
that
today
decision
is
a
one
off
in
either
its
treatment
of
agencies
or
its
treatment
of
precedent
as
to
the
first
this
very
term
presents
yet
another
example
of
the

resolve
to
roll
