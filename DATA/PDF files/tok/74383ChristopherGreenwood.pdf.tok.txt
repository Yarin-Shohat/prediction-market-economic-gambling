to
whom
it
may
concern
my
name
is
sam
altman
i
am
the
ceo
of
openai
the
world
leading
artificial
intelligence
research
laboratory
and
corporation
perhaps
best
known
for
the
large
language
model
and
the
image
generation
model
dall
before
openai
i
was
president
of
the
startup
accelerator
y
combinator
the
company
that
helped
launch
thousands
of
companies
including
airbnb
dropbox
doordash
reddit
stripe
and
twitch
while
president
of
y
combinator
i
helped
launch
the
yc
continuity
fund
a
700
million
fund
to
invest
in
yc
portfolio
companies
i
am
submitting
this
public
comment
to
support
kalshi
proposed
contract
on
congressional
control
as
a
long
time
investor
in
hundreds
of
early
stage
startups
i
know
from
personal
experience
that
congressional
control
has
significant
direct
and
predictable
impacts
on
the
risk
exposures
of
small
businesses
startups
and
their
founders
and
employees
here
is
an
example
of
how
political
control
can
directly
and
predictably
affect
the
risks
that
a
biotech
startup
faces
first
the
biotech
company
has
risk
from
fda
appointments
and
priorities
which
can
mean
the
difference
between
rapid
approval
of
a
new
treatment
or
a
yearslong
delay
that
can
cost
the
company
resources
and
in
extreme
cases
force
the
company
into
bankruptcy
or
a
firesale
the
company
also
faces
risk
regarding
federal
funding
for
research
additionally
a
congress
passing
a
mammoth
new
bill
may
force
small
businesses
to
spend
small
fortunes
trying
to
navigate
the
regulatory
uncertainty
as
the
rulemaking
process
plays
out
the
risks
of
these
events
is
directly
and
predictably
tied
to
congressional
control
and
elections
in
general
and
the
risk
management
tools
for
this
will
be
also
nearly
every
business
we
fund
faces
risk
from
congressional
action
in
multiple
ways
needless
to
say
then
these
contracts
have
legitimate
hedging
use
to
manage
risks
and
are
not
gaming
congressional
control
is
an
economically
significant
event
that
impacts
risk
and
many
companies
and
founders
and
employees
genuinely
need
to
hedge
against
the
contract
could
be
used
by
these
companies
founders
and
employees
to
manage
their
risk
very
effectively
in
my
experience
many
individuals
and
small
businesses
have
the
sophistication
and
foresight
to
hedge
their
risks
quite
effectively
and
if
the
cftc
approves
these
contracts
based
on
my
experience
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
contract
will
be
used
to
hedge
and
manage
risk
i
would
not
be
writing
this
letter
if
i
was
not
confident
that
this
contract
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
contracts
are
obviously
not
the
only
economic
exposure
that
small
businesses
and
individuals
have
to
elections
as
i
just
illustrated
there
are
already
significant
exposures
to
elections
these
contracts
would
actually
help
manage
their
existing
risk
as
an
added
advantage
the
price
of
the
contract
represents
the
best
wisdom
of
the
crowd
estimate
of
the
probability
of
a
given
party
winning
the
election
this
data
can
be
highly
valuable
to
small
businesses
trying
to
make
plans
about
the
future
and
wondering
about
the
expected
future
path
of
federal
policy
but
also
to
researchers
who
are
trying
to
estimate
the
effects
of
one
party
agenda
on
various
financial
and
economic
variables
it
thus
seems
to
me
that
the
risks
are
minimal
and
largely
speculative
whereas
the
benefits
are
real
and
large
the
cftc
would
be
remiss
to
miss
this
opportunity
to
bring
this
socially
valuable
activity
to
american
soil
