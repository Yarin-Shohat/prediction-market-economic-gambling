chairman
behnam
i
write
to
urge
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
to
proceed
deliberately
and
transparently
in
considering
any
proposed
rule
regarding
the
listing
of
event
contracts
by
designated
contract
markets
dcms
the
commission
has
a
long
history
of
promoting
leadership
on
the
global
stage
and
encouraging
financial
market
innovations
futures
markets
originally
offered
products
focused
on
agricultural
markets
necessary
for
farmers
and
ranchers
to
hedge
risk
the
forward
looking
cftc
has
over
time
approved
products
that
were
not
originally
contemplated
by
lawmakers
who
created
the
commission
and
its
authorities
but
that
fit
within
the
cftc
congressional
mandate
products
based
on
volatility
interest
rates
foreign
currency
weather
water
and
digital
assets
have
been
allowed
by
the
commission
and
have
demonstrated
market
value
excluding
broad
categories
of
products
goes
against
the
cftc
mandate
to
foster
innovation
i
am
concerned
by
reports
that
a
draft
event
contracts
rule
being
evaluated
by
the
commission
could
limit
the
ability
of
main
street
investors
to
hedge
risk
based
on
events
moving
forward
with
a
rule
that
limits
event
contracts
would
stifle
innovation
and
run
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
other
jurisdictions
have
approved
event
contracts
for
investors
to
utilize
in
hedging
risk
blocking
the
development
of
these
products
on
our
shores
will
place
markets
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
and
drive
innovative
companies
overseas
furthermore
i
have
concerns
that
the
cftc
may
attempt
to
advance
an
event
contracts
rule
through
a
closed
door
process
without
a
public
meeting
the
cftc
is
better
than
that
a
proposal
that
would
ban
products
with
clear
economic
value
to
main
street
americans
should
not
be
advanced
without
a
public
vote
by
the
commission
i
appreciate
your
commitment
to
transparency
to
date
and
ask
that
you
continue
in
that
vein
as
the
commission
evaluates
an
event
contracts
rulemaking
sincerely
