dear
cftc
i
writing
to
express
my
support
of
approving
prediction
markets
for
electoral
outcomes
not
only
for
kalshi
but
for
all
other
designated
contract
markets
dcm
under
the
supervision
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
the
existence
of
these
markets
are
within
the
public
interest
and
i
believe
they
should
be
considered
distinctly
from
recreational
gambling
i
agree
with
many
of
the
comments
from
other
academics
who
have
submitted
comments
to
the
cftc
on
this
topic
particularly
profs
tabarrok
furman
and
zitzewitz
i
wanted
to
add
a
few
additional
points
my
own
research
on
this
topic
is
about
prediction
markets
are
used
as
a
managerial
tool
by
leaders
of
companies
and
other
large
organizations
as
i
read
furman
letter
about
the
use
of
prediction
markets
inside
of
the
white
house
many
of
the
same
points
could
be
made
by
corporate
leaders
inside
of
fortune
500
companies
my
work
on
this
topic
has
included
econometric
case
studies
of
google
ford
motors
and
a
large
american
conglomerate
in
the
basic
materials
sector
anonymized
by
the
firm
request
published
in
the
review
of
economic
studies
other
researchers
have
studied
other
companies
ranging
from
hp
to
intel
although
the
traders
in
these
markets
are
sometimes
although
not
always
limited
to
company
employees
the
companies
nearly
always
include
and
consult
markets
on
external
industry
events
such
as
election
outcomes
you
may
remember
that
in
2008
the
cftc
previously
sought
input
on
new
regulations
regarding
event
contracts
73
fr
25669
a
coalition
of
companies
including
google
yahoo
and
microsoft
sought
to
persuade
the
cftc
to
adopt
similar
rules
and
representatives
from
google
met
directly
with
the
commission
and
its
staff
google
letter
to
the
commission
is
here
co
signed
by
yahoo
and
microsoft
wrote
a
separate
letter
concurring
with
google
here
i
view
this
as
additional
evidence
that
companies
find
economic
value
in
these
markets
in
summary
i
believe
the
commission
should
permit
these
markets
to
proceed
please
let
me
know
if
you
have
any
additional
questions
sincerely
