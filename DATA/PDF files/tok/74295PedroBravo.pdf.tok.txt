dear
cftc
my
name
is
pedro
bravo
and
i
am
a
recent
graduate
of
wake
forest
university
where
i
studied
economics
and
computer
science
during
my
time
there
i
had
the
opportunity
to
take
an
economics
class
on
prediction
markets
ecn
345
with
koleman
strumpf
this
class
opened
my
eyes
to
the
utility
of
prediction
markets
demonstrating
their
unique
ability
to
distill
information
and
gauge
market
sentiment
in
ways
traditional
polls
often
can
not
research
by
economists
like
strumpf
and
justin
wolfers
has
shown
that
prediction
markets
can
provide
remarkably
accurate
forecasts
of
future
events
by
aggregating
diverse
opinions
the
insights
i
gained
from
prediction
markets
proved
invaluable
during
my
job
interviews
as
a
senior
in
college
ultimately
helping
me
secure
a
position
as
an
equity
research
analyst
a
role
i
am
passionate
about
these
markets
like
all
financial
markets
are
not
without
their
challenges
they
can
attract
gamblers
driven
by
addiction
and
individuals
who
attempt
to
exploit
inside
information
however
the
benefits
they
offer
are
unparalleled
when
i
seek
insights
into
the
future
federal
funds
rate
i
turn
to
prediction
markets
instead
of
relying
solely
on
potentially
flawed
analyst
predictions
similarly
to
gauge
the
likely
outcome
of
an
election
i
look
to
platforms
like
predictit
although
prediction
markets
are
not
infallible
such
as
their
performance
during
the
2016
presidential
election
they
are
often
more
accurate
than
alternative
forecasting
methods
in
summary
prediction
markets
are
a
powerful
tool
for
understanding
and
anticipating
the
outcomes
of
various
events
and
their
role
in
providing
actionable
insights
is
invaluable
additionally
i
have
listed
some
research
papers
that
i
believe
can
be
extremely
helpful
to
the
cftc
in
making
their
decisions
