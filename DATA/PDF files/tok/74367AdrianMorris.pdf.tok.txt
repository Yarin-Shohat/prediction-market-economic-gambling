i
am
writing
to
express
my
strong
opposition
to
the
proposed
ban
on
election
contracts
and
prediction
markets
this
decision
seems
to
lack
sufficient
data
engagement
and
justification
i
believe
it
is
crucial
for
the
cftc
to
address
several
important
questions
regarding
this
proposal
1
what
specific
data
or
evidence
does
the
cftc
have
to
support
the
claim
that
election
markets
pose
a
significant
risk
to
the
integrity
of
elections
2
how
does
the
cftc
differentiate
between
gambling
and
legitimate
financial
risk
management
in
the
context
of
prediction
markets
3
what
engagement
has
the
cftc
conducted
with
stakeholders
including
prediction
market
platforms
investors
and
the
public
to
assess
the
potential
impacts
of
this
ban
4
why
does
the
cftc
believe
that
banning
election
markets
will
prevent
potential
election
tampering
or
misinformation
campaigns
as
opposed
to
regulating
them
to
ensure
transparency
and
integrity
5
how
does
the
cftc
address
concerns
that
banning
these
markets
might
push
them
to
offshore
and
illegal
platforms
where
there
is
no
regulation
or
consumer
protection
6
what
are
the
economic
implications
of
this
ban
for
businesses
and
investors
who
use
these
markets
as
tools
for
hedging
against
political
risks
7
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
address
the
legal
challenges
posed
by
platforms
like
kalshi
and
predictit
which
argue
that
the
agency
has
overstepped
its
authority
8
what
measures
does
the
cftc
propose
to
implement
to
ensure
that
innovation
in
financial
markets
is
not
stifled
by
this
ban
9
how
does
the
cftc
reconcile
its
decision
with
the
fact
that
prediction
markets
have
provided
valuable
data
for
gauging
public
sentiment
and
economic
forecasting
10
what
alternative
solutions
has
the
cftc
considered
that
would
allow
election
markets
to
operate
under
a
regulated
framework
ensuring
both
market
integrity
and
consumer
protection
i
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
and
provide
clear
answers
to
these
questions
it
is
essential
to
recognize
the
potential
benefits
of
regulated
prediction
markets
and
to
develop
a
framework
that
allows
them
to
operate
safely
and
effectively
within
the
financial
system
