forecastex
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
the
commission
proposed
rulemaking
concerning
event
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
forecastex
is
a
designated
contract
market
dcm
and
derivatives
clearing
organization
dco
that
lists
forecast
contracts
which
are
a
subset
of
event
contracts
on
macroeconomic
and
climate
events
forecastex
is
supportive
of
the
commission
goal
to
increase
the
transparency
surrounding
the
listing
of
event
contracts
by
creating
rules
that
clearly
define
what
types
of
contracts
are
prohibited
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
such
rules
are
long
overdue
and
can
help
registered
entities
by
providing
clear
standards
that
can
guide
their
decision
making
processes
however
as
proposed
the
cftc
revisions
to
do
not
accomplish
this
goal
but
instead
make
the
regulatory
environment
more
opaque
for
registered
entities
the
commission
proposal
appears
to
be
focused
on
achieving
two
things
prohibiting
election
related
contracts
and
reducing
the
amount
of
resources
that
the
cftc
devotes
to
reviews
in
their
effort
to
prohibit
contracts
related
to
elections
the
commission
is
pursuing
overly
broad
interpretations
of
statutory
language
related
to
the
terms
involve
gaming
and
activity
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
while
the
proposal
may
achieve
the
commission
short
term
goal
of
banning
election
contracts
it
will
come
at
the
expense
of
a
consistent
clear
and
well
supported
regulatory
regime
surrounding
the
listing
of
event
contracts
given
this
potential
to
stunt
the
growth
of
a
new
and
innovative
market
forecastex
can
not
support
the
commission
proposal
a
comprehensive
regime
surrounding
event
contracts
is
needed
but
this
proposal
is
not
it
to
be
clear
forecastex
is
not
commenting
on
the
merits
of
election
contracts
instead
forecastex
is
deeply
concerned
by
the
process
through
which
the
commission
is
going
about
its
prohibition
event
contracts
are
a
new
and
developing
field
of
products
and
forecastex
suspects
that
the
commission
has
not
yet
fully
evaluated
or
considered
all
of
the
potential
consequences
of
this
rulemaking
as
a
self
regulatory
organization
that
has
been
solely
focused
on
event
contracts
for
close
to
three
years
forecastex
believes
it
may
be
uniquely
suited
to
comment
on
these
downstream
consequences
forecastex
hopes
that
its
comments
will
be
helpful
to
the
commission
as
it
attempts
the
complicated
task
of
regulating
this
innovative
category
of
products
contracts
that
involve
enumerated
activities
forecastex
requests
that
the
commission
provide
additional
guidance
as
to
when
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
is
proposing
to
revise
cftc
regulation
so
that
it
refers
to
event
contracts
that
involve
an
enumerated
activity
89
fr

however
the
only
guidance
that
the
commission
gives
as
to
when
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
is
plain
meaning
definitions
of
involve
from
several
dictionaries
the
commission
also
states
that
a
contract
may
involve
an
enumerated
activity
even
in
situations
where
the
contract
underlying
is
not
an
enumerated
activity
89
fr
48968
48974
as
currently
proposed
cftc
regulations
will
not
give
designated
entities
clarity
as
to
what
contracts
are
prohibited
under
cftc
rules
an
argument
could
be
made
that
virtually
any
conceivable
event
contract
involves
enumerated
activities
for
example
terrorist
attacks
have
historically
had
large
impacts
on
economies
and
financial
markets
does
a
contract
on
the
gdp
growth
rate
involve
terrorism
because
terrorism
to
or
gdp
growth
and
an
event
contract
position
predicting
gdp
growth
as
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
the
prediction
that
there
will
not
be
a
large
scale
terrorist
attack
that
causes
massive
economic
damage
does
an
event
contract
with
a
global
climate
underlying
such
as
a
global
drought
index
involve
war
because
it
has
been
shown
that
climate
change
relates
closely
to
the
incidence
of
armed
conflict

does
an
event
contract
on
corporate
profits
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
if
it
is
shown
that
at
least
one
company
whose
profits
were
included
earned
a
portion
of
their
profits
through
unlawful
means
similarly
does
an
event
contract
on
the
revenue
collected
by
a
state
government
entail
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
since
a
portion
of
the
revenue
will
be
from
fines
collected
for
violations
of
state
law
while
gdp
growth
and
corporate
profit
contracts
could
not
be
prohibited
under
regulation
because
they
meet
the
definition
of
an
excluded
commodities
under
cea
section
a
broad
interpretation
of
involve
could
conceivably
be
used
to
prohibit
any
other
contracts
forecastex
does
not
believe
that
it
is
the
commission
intent
to
prohibit
these
types
of
contracts
and
forecastex
strongly
believes
that
such
contracts
should
not
be
considered
to
involve
enumerated
activities
however
by
leaving
the
definition
of
involve
vague
the
proposal
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
the
commission
could
prohibit
any
contract
because
it
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
possibility
is
also
raised
that
the
rules
may
be
applied
arbitrarily
with
some
contracts
being
accepted
and
others
rejected
when
contracts
have
a
similar
tangential
relationship
to
the
enumerated
activity
this
problem
is
worsened
by
the
commission
proposing
to
categorically
prohibit
any
contract
involving
enumerated
activity
at
least
under
the
current
rules
the
commission
has
to
determine
both
that
a
contract
involves
or
relates
to
an
enumerated
activity
and
that
it
additionally
is
against
the
public
interest
the
proposal
would
prohibit
any
contract
involving
an
enumerated
activity
regardless
of
any
positive
public
interest
benefits
finally
a
broad
interpretation
of
involve
will
likely
increase
the
amount
of
resources
that
the
commission
has
to
devote
to
reviewing
event
contracts
since
nearly
every
proposed
contract
could
involve
an
enumerated
activity
under
the
interpretation
resulting
in
an
increased
number
of
reviews
the
commission
states
that
its
purpose
in
proposing
the
amendments
to
cftc
regulation
is
to
support
efforts
by
registered
entities
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
by
more
clearly
identifying
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
89
fr
48968
48969
unless
the
commission
more
clearly
defines
when
a
contract
involves
enumerated
activity
the
proposed
amendments
to
cftc
regulation
will
not
achieve
this
goal
while
the
commission
can
not
foresee
every
possible
event
contract
that
could
be
submitted
involving
enumerated
activities
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
expect
the
commission
to
provide
guidelines
describing
when
they
would
consider
such
a
situation
to
exist
forecastex
suggest
the
following
three
criteria
as
a
starting
point
for
such
guidance
first
the
commission
should
recognize
that
an
enumerated
activity
affecting
the
outcome
of
an
event
contract
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
alone
for
determining
that
an
event
contract
involves
the
enumerated
activity
making
this
recognition
in
its
guidance
will
appropriately
limit
the
scope
of
the
enumerated
activities
as
the
list
of
event
contracts
that
affect
or
are
affected
by
an
enumerated
activity
is
close
to
infinitely
broad
further
this
standard
is
consistent
with
giving
the
term
involve
its
ordinary
meaning
dictionaries
including
those
cited
by
the
commission
define
the
word
involve
in
multiple
ways
generally
involve
is
defined
as
both
to
include
as
a
necessary
and
important
part
and
as
to
affect
for
example
merriam
webster
defines
involve
as
both
to
require
as
a
necessary
accompaniment

and
affect

this
pattern
is

that

necessary
part
or
result
of
it
and
if
a
situation
an
event
or
an
activity
involves
somebody
something
they

it

if

to

necessity
entail

a
project
involving
years
of
work
7
to
relate
to
our
affect
the
matter
involves
his
honor
since
there
are
two
definitions
of
involve
the
commission
should
only
apply
one
of
those
definitions
to
us
code
further
because
of
how
broadly
interpreting
involve
to
mean
affect
would
apply
the
statute
defining
involve
to
mean
only
a
necessary
part
would
provide
a
clearer
guideline
for
market
participants
registered
entities
and
the
commission
to
evaluate
potential
contracts
this
guideline
would
provide
clarity
that
all
four
of
the
contracts
described
earlier
do
not
involve
enumerated
activity
second
the
commission
should
specify
that
an
event
contract
is
considered
to
involve
an
enumerated
activity
when
an
enumerated
activity
or
the
extent
of
an
enumerated
activity
is
likely
to
determine
the
outcome
of
the
event
underlying
the
event
contract
this
is
an
appropriate
way
of
determining
if
an
enumerated
activity
is
a
necessary
part
of
a
contract
for
example
a
measure
of
corporate
profits
may
include
some
profits
which
were
earned
through
unlawful
means
but
such
profits
would
represent
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total
corporate
profits
and
an
increase
or
decrease
in
illicit
activity
would
be
unlikely
to
be
a
significant
enough
portion
of
corporate
profits
in
order
to
cause
the
outcome
of
a
corporate
profits
event
contract
to
change
third
the
commission
should
specify
that
contracts
that
have
an
identical
risk
profile
as
a
contract
on
an
enumerated
activity
involve
that
enumerated
activity
in
other
words
contracts
involve
an
enumerated
activity
if
they
serve
as
a
proxy
for
a
contract
on
enumerated
activity
for
example
take
a
hypothetical
event
contract
will
there
be
a
victory
parade
in
downtown
kansas
city
between
february
10
2025
and
february
17
2025
while
such
a
contract
would
potentially
not
meet
the
commission
proposed
gaming
definition
since
many
different
victory
parades
could
hypothetically
cause
the
contract
to
settle
to
yes
the
contract
provides
essentially
the
same
risk
profile
as
the
contract
will
the
kansas
city
chiefs
win
super
bowl
lviii
which
clearly
is
a
gaming
contract
this
standard
ensures
that
it
is
clear
to
registered
entities
that
they
can
not
avoid
the
restrictions
on
enumerated
activities
by
listing
perfectly
or
nearly
perfectly
correlated
events
the
above
guidelines
if
adopted
by
the
cftc
note
that
adopting
these
or
similar
guidelines
would
not
require
a
re
proposal
because
such
guidance
could
be
articulated
in
the
final
rule
and
would
not
necessitate
an
amendment
to
the
proposed
language
would
give
registered
entities
clear
boundaries
while
also
not
requiring
the
commission
to
undertake
an
excessive
number
of
reviews
which
are
disruptive
for
market
participants
costly
for
registered
entities
and
resource
intensive
for
the
commission
ii
proposed
gaming
definition
forecastex
is
not
commenting
on
the
virtues
of
political
event
contracts
however
forecastex
is
concerned
with
the
processes
that
the
commission
is
employing
through
this
proposed
rulemaking
in
order
to
prohibit
these
contracts
the
commission
appears
to
be
primarily
concerned
with
creating
a
definition
of
gaming
that
excludes
political
event
contracts
as
opposed
to
a
definition
that
aligns
with
congressional
intent
and
brings
clarity
to
markets
including
elections
and
other
contests
in
the
definition
of
gaming
does
not
appear
consistent
with
congressional
intent
in
the
colloquy
between
senators
lincoln
and
feinstein
when
explaining
the
gaming
provision
senator
lincoln
articulated
that
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
these
types
of
contracts
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
156
cong
rec
s5906
07
the
only
examples
of
gaming
given
in
the
colloquy
are
sporting
events
furthermore
given
that
gaming
is
not
commonly
understood
to
include
elections
it
appears
likely
that
congress
would
have
articulated
elections
as
a
separate
enumerated
category
if
they
intended
for
it
to
be
an
enumerated
activity
this
point
was
also
raised
by
commissioner
mersinger
in
her
dissent
89
fr
48968
48994
congress
easily
could
have
included
elections
and
awards
as
enumerated
activities
but
it
did
not
confronted
with
this
congressional
silence
i
do
not
believe
the
commission
can
simply
decree
that
elections
and
awards
are
enumerated
activities
as
a
result
the
commission
gaming
definition
is
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
instead
the
commission
should
adopt
a
definition
of
gaming
that
is
limited
to
contracts
on
the
outcome
of
games
contracts
on
the
performance
of
a
competitor
in
a
game
and
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
games
a
second
problem
with
the
commission
proposed
gaming
definition
relates
to
how
the
definition
is
framed
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
is
not
wholly
dependent
on
the
content
of
the
contract
but
whether
the
participant
who
enters
the
contract
is
undertaking
gambling
activity
89
fr
48968
48974
48975
the
commission
proposes
to
define
gaming
in
new
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
the
terms
gaming
and
gambling
are
used
interchangeably
in
common
usage
and
dictionary
definitions
the
proposed
definition
further
recognizes
that
under
a
number
of
state
statutes
gambling
betting
or
wagering
is
recognized
to
include
a
person
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
upon
a
game
or
contest
or
the
performance
of
competitors
in
a
game
or
contest
this
is
a
problematic
interpretation
as
it
risks
providing
an
air
of
legitimacy
to
speculative
strategies
which
are
effectively
gambling
in
other
cftc
regulated
products
strategies
using
existing
financial
products
such
as
0dte
options
should
not
be
considered
any
less
gambling
than
wagering
funds
on
the
outcome
of
a
sports
contest
virtually
any
contract
offered
at
a
cftc
registered
exchange
can
be
used
in
a
manner
akin
to
gambling
the
cftc
articulated
a
similar
concern
in
the
proposal
when
justifying
its
position
that
gaming
contracts
should
be
universally
prohibited
the
commission
is
concerned
about
conflating
gambling
and
financial
instruments
in
a
manner
that
could
particularly
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
market
participants
among
other
things
it
could
improperly
signal
to
certain
retail
investors
that
these
contracts
are
instruments
to
be
used
for
investment
purposes
89
fr
48968
48982
while
the
commission
was
discussing
the
risks
of
allowing
gaming
products
to
trade
on
cftc
exchanges
the
same
effect
could
occur
by
declaring
certain
products
to
be
gambling
products
not
declared
gambling
even
if
they
could
be
used
in
a
manner
akin
to
gambling
could
be
seen
by
retail
investors
as
legitimized
leading
to
a
conflation
of
gambling
and
financial
instruments
in
a
manner
that
could
confuse
retail
market
participants
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
a
retail
customer
being
told
by
an
unscrupulous
advisor
that
the
cftc
defined
which
contracts
are
gambling
and
the
risk
laden
speculative
0dte
options
strategy
that
they
are
pushing
were
not
included
on
that
list
the
commission
can
side
step
this
risk
entirely
by
adopting
a
more
clear
and
well
defined
definition
of
gaming
that
defines
gaming
contracts
as
contracts
on
or
related
to
games
as
opposed
to
contracts
which
constitute
gambling
the
commission
insistence
on
prohibiting
election
contracts
as
gaming
is
especially
odd
given
that
the
cea
gives
the
commission
a
way
to
prohibit
election
contracts
without
involving
gaming
gives
the
commission
the
ability
to
prohibit
contracts
through
rule
or
regulation
that
it
determines
are
similar
to
the
enumerated
categories
this
category
allows
the
commission
to
prohibit
contracts
not
cleanly
falling
into
the
enumerated
categories
that
the
commission
believes
are
against
the
public
interest
from
the
perspective
of
process
this
would
provide
a
far
superior
method
for
restricting
the
trading
of
election
contracts
as
it
would
not
involve
defining
gaming
and
unlawful
under
federal
and
state
law
in
ways
that
bring
confusion
to
registered
entities
commissioner

echoes
this
point
where
she
states
i

baffled
at
why
the

is
tying
itself
into
knots
by
trying
to
reason
its
way
from

to

to
contests
to
elections
and
awards
rather
than
simply
do
what
congress
said
it
could
do
consider
whether
elections
and

are
similar
to
gaming

another

questions
if
it
is
currently
inappropriate
for
the
commission
to
attempt
to
codify
its
restrictions
on

at
this
time
given
ongoing

much
of

in

that
it
could
potentially
lose
the

if
on
judicial
review
it
is
determined
that
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
does
not
involve
gaming
the
commission
may
consider
whether
that
activity
is
similar
to
gaming
a
ruling
against
the
cftc
in
that
legal
action
would
prevent
the
cftc
from
passing
its
proposal
in
its
current
form
furthermore
the
commission
ability
to
appropriately
respond
to
comment
letters
on
this
proposal
in
a
reasoned
manner
may
be
limited
by
ongoing
litigation
due
to
the
impact
that
the
commission
responses
could
have
on
the
case
there
also
does
not
appear
to
be
an
alternative
to
the
commission
proposal
that
would
be
a
logical
outgrowth
of
the
current
proposal
given
an
adverse
ruling
declaring
that
elections
are
a
similar
activity
to
gaming
or
similar
to
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
would
likely
require
a
re
proposal
as
the
cftc
would
be
changing
the
fundamental
statutory
basis
for
its
decision
for
a
commission
that
is
apparently
committed
to
using
its
resources
as
efficiently
as
possible
it
is
odd
that
the
commission
would
propose
regulations
whose
ability
to
be
passed
into
a

rule
is
dependent
on
the

iii
election
contracts
are
not
unlawful
under
state
law
the
cftc
claim
that
event
contracts
on
elections
are
unlawful
under
state
law
impermissibly
expands
the
category
of
unlawful
activity
far
beyond
what
congress
intended
the
commission
argues
that
because
a
number
of
states
have
laws
which
prohibit
gambling
on
elections
that
contracts
on
election
outcomes
are
unlawful
under
state
law

the
commission
notes
that
a
number
of
states
prohibit
betting
or
wagering
on
a
variety
of
occurrences
or
non
occurrences
associated
with
athletic
games
as
well
as
non
sporting
events
this
highlights
that
in
some
instances
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
may
also
involve
a
second
enumerated
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
for
example
as
discussed
in
section
supra
the
commission
found
in
the
kalshi
order
that
the
subject
contracts
involved
both
gaming
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
however
as
the
cftc
notes
the
commission
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
futures
and
swaps
contracts
traded
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
preempting
the
application
of
state
law
with
respect
to
such
transactions
and
meaning
that
transacting
in
such
contracts
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
can
not
of
itself
constitute
unlawful
activity
for
state
law
purposes
89
fr
48977
footnote
84
the
commission
goes
on
to
claim
that
even
if
the
application
of
state
law
is
preempted
this
does
not
stop
a
contract
from
involving
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
89
fr

footnote

the
commission
released
an
expanded
version
of
this
analysis
in
their
order
prohibiting
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
taking
a
position
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
contests
between
electoral
candidates
such
that
wagering
on
elections
is
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
of
the
contracts
thus
while
transactions
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
on
a
dcm
do
not
violate
for
example
state
bucket
shop
laws
they
nevertheless
involve
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
in
a
number
of
states
wagering
on
elections
to
permit
such
transactions
on
a
dcm
would
undermine
important
state
interests
expressed
in

applicable

the
commission
position
is
fundamentally
flawed
a
contract
can
not
involve
unlawful
activity
if
the
activity
is
not
unlawful
context
matters
in
a
legal
analysis
and
determining
whether
an
activity
is
unlawful
is
fundamentally
a
legal
analysis
the
commission
attempt
to
divorce
the
activity
from
the
context
in
which
it
occurs
inevitably
leads
to
a
distortion
of
what
is
lawful
as
is
seen
here
the
commission
claims
that
wagering
on
elections
is
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
of
election
contracts
and
that
wagering
on
elections
is
illegal
under
numerous
state
laws
but
this
is
not
exactly
correct
wagering
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
is
illegal
under
a
number
of
state
laws
when
it
is
done
outside
of
a
cftc
regulated
dcm
nothing
in
an
election
contract
suggests
that
an
essential
feature
of
the
contract
is
wagering
on
elections
outside
of
a
cftc
regulated
environment
the
only
contexts
in
which
wagering
on
elections
can
occur
under
such
a
contract
are
lawful
ones
when
the
cftc
reinterprets
an
activity
so
that
it
removes
important
context
behind
that
activity
that
activity
can
no
longer
be
considered
an
essential
feature
the
fact
that
state
laws
might
prohibit
an
activity
if
it
is
undertaken
outside
of
a
cftc
regulated
marketplace
does
not
mean
that
it
involves
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
but
even
more
critically
the
commission
argument
can
not
be
universally
applied
without
prohibiting
all
event
contracts
many
states
have
broad
laws
concerning
illegal
gambling
which
apply
to
risking
anything
of
value
upon
any
uncertain
outcome
see
for
example

a
person
is

of
a

the

acknowledges
that

recognize

to
encompass
more
broadly

not

the

concluded
that

this
poses
a
serious
problem
for
the
commission
interpretation
if
separated
from
the
context
of
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
any
possible
event
contract
or
any
derivative
that
a
dcm
could
list
would
be
unlawful
under
these
state
laws
the
commission
exact
language
in
the
kalshi
order
could
be
applied
to
any
event
contract
as
demonstrated
in
the
below
example
for
a
real
gdp
contract
taking
a
position
in
the
real
gdp
contract
would
be
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
future
contingent
event
such
that
wagering
on
future
contingent
events
is
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
of
the
contracts
thus
while
transactions
in
the
real
gdp
contracts
on
a
dcm
do
not
violate
for
example
state
bucket
shop
laws
they
nevertheless
involve
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
in
a
number
of
states
wagering
on
the
outcome
of
future
contingent
events
to
permit
such
transactions
on
a
dcm
would
undermine
important
state
interests
expressed
in
statutes
and
state
constitutions
see

19
above
regarding
new
york
law
separate
and
apart
from
those
applicable
to
trading
on
a
dcm
real
gdp
could
be
replaced
with
any
event
contract
and
the
logic
would
remain
identical
the
commission
can
not
even
claim
that
there
is
a
lesser
state
interest
in
preventing
the
staking
of
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
future
contingent
events
as
new
york
gambling
prohibition
is
enshrined
in
their
state
constitution
see
footnote
19
above
regarding
new
york
law
and
making
that
determination
would
cause
the

to
serve
as
an
arbiter
of
a
state
own
public
interest
determination
89

a
role
the
commission
has
determined
is
inappropriate
for
the
cftc
the
only
way
to
apply
the
commission
logic
consistently
would
be
to
declare
all
event
contracts
unlawful
the
commission
might
as
well
claim
that
all
exchange
traded
futures
transactions
are
unlawful
under
federal
law
because
the
cea
makes
it
unlawful
for
any
person
to
offer

enter
into
to
enter
into
a
contract
for
the
purchase
or
sale
of
a
commodity
for
future
delivery

even
though
the
products
are
traded
on
an
exchange
which
is
the
exception
in
the
above
referenced
cea
section
they
contain
as
necessary
part
a
contract
for
the
purchase
of
a
commodity
for
future
delivery
which
is
prohibited
this
logic
is
clearly
absurd
but
it
is
not
substantively
different
from
what
the
commission
has
offered
in
their
proposal
as
the
cftc
has
recognized
this
result
would
be
contrary
to
congressional
intent
89
fr

as
previously
quoted
and
applying
the
interpretation
arbitrarily
is
not
a
viable
option
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
the
only
remaining
option
is
for
the
commission
to
reject
an
interpretation
which
determines
that
lawfully
transacting
contracts
on
a
cftc
exchange
involves
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
forecastex
believes
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
commission
analysis
of
state
laws
while
it
does
not
support
a
position
that
election
contracts
are
unlawful
under
state
law
may
support
a
position
that
election
contracts
are
similar
to
the
enumerated
category
of
activities
unlawful
under

law
which
could
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
prohibition
under

of

generally
agrees
with
the
commission
conclusion
that
it
is
not
limited
to
evaluating
the
hedging
or
price
basing
utility
of
an
event
contract
as
part
of
its

may
evaluate
both
these
and
other
factors
89

however
based
on
the
factors
which
the
commission
has
articulated
it
appears
that
the
commission
is
underestimating
the
positive
benefits
of
event
contracts
while
overstating
their
potential
harms
excluded
commodities
and
public
interest
evaluations
the
commission
analyzes
the
enumerated
categories
to
identify
the
types
of
public
interest
considerations
that
should
be
evaluated
when
analyzing
whether
an
event
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
since
the
congressional
record
is
limited
to
the
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
there
is
limited
public
record
for
the
commission
to
base
their
public
interest
determinations
off
of
however
a
textual
analysis
of
cea
section
reveals
additional
factors
that
should
be
considered
in
the
cftc
public
interest
determinations
in
addition
to
naming
enumerated
categories
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
statute
also
identifies
product
categories
specifically
those
meeting
the
excluded
commodity
definition
in
cea
section
which
are
excluded
from
public
interest
reviews
the
only
reasonable
explanation
for
such
an
exclusion
is
that
the
framers
of
cea
section
believed
that
event
contracts
meeting
the
excluded
commodities
definition
were
in
the
public
interest
the
commission
appears
to
endorse
such
a
view
when
discussing
the
gaming
definition
the
cftc
rejected
a
broader
interpretation
of
gaming
due
to
the
fact
that
such
a
definition
could
encompass
event
contracts
that
were
not
intended
by

as
a
result
when
the
commission
is
developing
a
framework
for
determining
if
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
an
important
consideration
should
be
whether
the
factors
that
make
up
that
framework
would
suggest
that
event
contracts
on
cea
section
excluded
commodities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
public
interest
factors
that
the

uses
would
suggest
a
negative
public

determination
for
those
products
it
is
likely
that

with
the
congressional
intent
of

hedging
value
of
event
contracts
forecastex
believes
it
is
important
for
the
commission
to
recognize
that
hedging
in
an
event
market
may
not
appear
like
a
typical
hedge
in
other
markets
that
the
commission
regulates
event
contracts
typically
do
not
provide
a
1
pure
hedge
for
other
financial
instruments
instead
they
provide
hedges
for
specific
risks
within
a
given
portfolio
market
participants
can
use
event
contracts
to
hedge
risks
in
their
financial
portfolios
uncertainty
about
events
particularly
uncertainly
related
to
macroeconomic
and
climate
risks
expose
participants
in
financial
markets
to
substantial
risk
see
for
example
turan
bali
stephen
brown
and
yi
tang
macroeconomic
uncertainty
and
expected
stock
returns
american
economic
association
december
2014
these
risks
can
not
accurately
be
hedged
without
event
contracts
instead
participants
in
financial
markets
must
hedge
their
exposure
after
macroeconomic
data
releases
occur
typically
on
trading
days
with
a
major
macroeconomic
release
a
flurry
of
activity
in
bond
and
equity
markets
follows
the
release
with
increased
price
volatility
these
releases
give
market
participants
new
information
and
significant
surprises
in
the
releases
expose
participants
to
unwanted
risks
for
example
just
this
past
week
significant
market
turmoil
resulted
from
a
higher
than
expected
unemployment
rate
and
lower
than
expected
payrolls
in

the
current

showed
unemployment
which
was
above
market
consensus
estimates
and
a

in

employment
which
was
below
market
consensus
estimates
the

index
opened
at
et
lower
than
the
previous
night
close
participants
then
must
hedge
the
risks
they
did
not
fully
understand
previously
after
the
macroeconomic
release
event
contracts
have
the
potential
to
revolutionize
this
process
since
event
contracts
pay
participants
when
macroeconomic
releases
are
higher
or
lower
than
expected
they
allow
participants
to
hedge
risks
associated
with
these
announcements
for
example
market
participants
who
hold
retail
stocks
may
hedge
their
exposure
to
a
poor
retail
sales
report
by
purchasing
event
contracts
that
pay
out
when
retail
sales
are
lower
than
expected
alternatively
a
bond
investor
could
use
event
contracts
on
inflation
levels
to
hedge
their
bond
portfolio
due
to
inflation
impact
on
interest
rates
using
event
contracts
allows
participants
to
directly
hedge
these
macroeconomic
risks

which
demonstrates
that
a
binary
recession
prediction
market
can
be
used
as
a
hedge
for
macroeconomic
recession
risk
in
equity
and
bond
markets
before
the
macroeconomic
data
is
released
importantly
because
event
contracts
are
specifically
targeted
at
specific
events
and
macroeconomic
data
releases
they
allow
participants
to
hedge
their
exposure
to
that
particular
event
without
sacrificing
all
of
the
upside
in
their
instruments
like
a

pure
hedge
would
require
no
other

a

those

may

complete
information
than
what
can

for

they
may
want
to
know
how
uncertain
the
market
is
about
its
future
estimate
and
whether
that
uncertainty
is
skewed
to
one
side
or
the
other
event
contracts
can
help
make
markets
more
complete
by
providing
this
information
a
series
of
event
contracts
with
the
same
underlying
event
but
different
threshold
prices
can
help
estimate
the
cumulative
market
forecast
distribution
of
uncertain
future
values
for
example
take
a
series
of
event
contracts
based
on
average
global
temperature
in
2040
with
increments
between
degrees
celsius
above
the
20
th
century
average
to
degrees
celsius
above
the
20
th
century
average
the
prices
of
these
contracts
would
show
the
probability
of
any
given
temperature
and
together
form
a
probability
distribution
that
would
allow
hedgers
to
see
the
uncertainty
and
skewness
in
the
market
prediction
this
would
allow
hedgers
to
construct
any
hedge
they
needed
to
hedge
their
non

forecast
contracts
will
help
improve
efficiency
by
allowing

to

as
a
result
the
cftc
should
recognize
that
the
predictive
power
of
event
markets
is
effectively
price
basing
even
if
the
cftc
does
not
want
to
consider
it
price
basing
the
cftc
should
recognize
the
informational
value
of
event
contracts
as
a
positive
public
interest
factor
that
should
be
at
the
forefront
of
any
public
interest
evaluation
given
that
informational
value
of
event
contracts
is
typically
touted
as
their
main
public
interest
benefit
in
academic
research
forecastex
finds
it
troubling
that
the
commission
does
not
mention
these
benefits
when
discussing
the
public
interest
factors
it
will
consider
other
than
a
couple
passing
mentions
to
traditional
price
basing
while
event
contracts
reduce
uncertainty
about
the
future
the
value
of
that
predictive
power
will
vary
depending
on
the
underlying
event
as
not
every
reduction
in
uncertainty
creates
a
public
good
for
example
a
gaming
contract
based
on
the
outcome
of
the
kentucky
derby
is
unlikely
to
create
any
public
good
even
if
it
reduces
the
uncertainty
involved
in
the
outcome
of
the
kentucky
derby
there
are
four
criteria
that
the
commission
should
be
evaluating
when
determining
if
the
price
basing
function
of
an
event
contract
contributes
to
the
public
good
first
does
the
event
contract
generate
information
that
is
useful
for
businesses
when
planning
their
future
decisions
this
is
akin
the
classic
formulation
of
price
basing
in
futures
markets
a
farmer
may
use
the
futures
prices
of
agricultural
goods
to
determine
the
future
supply
and
demand
on
various
crops
which
is
a
useful
informational
input
when
determining
which
crops
should
be
planted
in
a
given
year
similarly
a
business
can
glean
information
from
various
event
contracts
to
determine
their
optimal
strategy
for
example
an
event
contract
on
retail
sales
would
provide
a
useful
input
for
a
business
deciding
whether
or
not
to
expand
its
operations
as
retail
sales
projections
can
be
used
to
forecast
future
demand
for
goods
second
does
the
event
underlying
the
contract
provide
information
that
impacts
the
pricing
of
other
financial
products
this
is
similar
though
subtly
different
than
evaluating
the
hedging
utility
of
a
contract
for
example
an
event
contract
on
whether
or
not
a
recession
will
occur
within
a
given
timeframe
would
provide
useful
information
to
an
investor
who
is
trying
to
determine
whether
or
not
equities
are
overvalued
regardless
of
whether
they
were
attempting
to
hedge
equity
exposure
third
does
the
event
contract
provide
valuable
information
to
the
non
investing
public
the
informational
benefits
that
an
event
contract
provides
are
not
necessarily
limited
to
individuals
who
are
actively
involved
in
financial
markets
for
example
an
event
contract
based
upon
the
number
of
manufacturing
jobs
could
provide
factory
workers
with
valuable
insight
into
their
job
security
over
the
medium
to
long
run
regardless
of
their
investment
portfolios
finally
does
the
event
contract
provide
information
that
will
be
valuable
to
policymakers
for
example
an
event
contract
based
on
the
amount
of
co2
in
the
atmosphere
would
provide
policymakers
with
estimates
of
future
carbon
emissions
provide
a
clear
estimate
of
the
public
belief
on
the
future
trajectory
of
global
warming
while
also
providing
an
estimate
of
future
pollution
levels
all
of
which
would
be
valuable
to
a
policymaker
determining
climate
policy
if
the
answers
to
any
of
the
four
criteria
is
yes
that
should
be
weighed
in
favor
of
the
contract
in
the
commission
public
interest
analysis
a
contract
in
which
multiple
criteria
are
weighted
positively
is
highly
unlikely
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
above
approach
is
reinforced
by
examining
the
excluded
commodities
described
in
cea
section
contracts
on
these
excluded
commodities
which
congress
identified
as
in
the
public
interest
due
to
their
exclusion
from
reviews
are
likely
to
provide
significant
informational
benefits
and
reductions
in
uncertainty
for
businesses
investors
the
general
public
as
well
as
policymakers
any
of
the
contracts
that
the
cftc
has
identified
as
falling
under
section
exclusion
would
show
significant
price
basing
benefits
under
the
crtieria
proposed
above
this
demonstrates
that
our
proposed
approach
is
consistent
with
congressional
intent
evaluation
of
the
price
basing
or
informational
value
of
an
event
contract
should
be
a
critical
piece
of
any
public
interest
analysis
educational
value
of
event
contracts
apart
from
the
value
that
event
contracts
offer
as
hedging
and
informational
vehicles
event
contracts
also
contribute
to
the
public
interest
because
of
their
educational
value
this
positive
public
interest
factor
has
not
been
recognized
by
the
commission
fundamentally
event
contracts
create
a
financial
incentive
for
market
participants
to
be
better
informed
about
the
events
that
are
the
subject
of
various
event
contracts
at
the
same
time
event
contracts
punish
false
beliefs
by
subjecting
their
holders
to
financial
penalties
the
result
is
an
incentive
system
which
rewards
participants
who
garner
greater
knowledge
and
discard
false
beliefs
in
fact
research
has
demonstrated
that
participation
in
event
markets
can
change
opinions
about
complex
and
entrenched
beliefs
like
climate
change

it
is
not
clear
how
an
evaluation
of
whether

good
would
differ
in
any
meaningful
way
from
an
evaluation
of
whether
a

the
commission
should
provide
greater
clarification
on
what
a

evaluation
entails

if
it
is
any
different
than
a
public

evaluation
beyond

the

identifies
three
additional

all

problematic
as

articulated
them
the

not
be
considered
in

the
cftc
proposes
to
evaluate
the

in

the

that
the

does
not
get
drawn
into
a
regulatory

enforcement
role
for
which
it
is
not
well
equipped
to
be
clear
the

does
not
administer

any

activity

that

with

to
any
event
contract
that
is
found
not
to
be
contrary
to
the
public

the
cftc
would
exercise
its

standard
the

whether

however
it
is
not
clear
how
such
a
review
would
or
even
could
be
so
distinguished
if
an
event
contract
has
an
increased
risk
of
manipulation
to
the
extent
that
the
commission
determines
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
how
could
such
a
contract
possibly
meet
dcm
core
principle
3
forecastex
does
not
believe
that
any
such
contract
could
fulfill
these
conditions
conversely
if
a
dcm
has
demonstrated
its
proposed
contract
meets
core
principle
3
and
is
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
it
is
unclear
how
the
commission
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
of
manipulation
concerns
the
commission
should
abandon
this
standard
as
manipulation
concerns
are
already
addressed
by
core
principle
3
the
lack
of
a
cash
underlying
does
not
make
an
event
contract
susceptible
to
manipulation
the
commission
uses
this
manipulation
standard
when
proposing
its
categorical
determination
that
gaming
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
specifically
the
commission
opines
that
gaming
contracts
are
more
susceptible
to
manipulation
because
they
have
no
underlying
cash
market
89
fr
48968
48982
the
commission
further
notes
that
most
contracts
falling
within
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
would
have
no
underlying
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
directly
correlated
price
forming
information
the
lack
of
price
forming
information
for
contracts
involving
gaming
or
the
availability
of
only
opaque
and
unregulated
sources
of
price
forming
information
may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating
to
the
trading
and
pricing
of
such
contracts
while
decreasing
the
ability
of
the
offering
exchange
or
the
commission
to
detect
such
activity
while
discussing
its
reason
for
prohibiting
all
contracts
related
to
gaming
the
commission
raises
the
preceding
points
as
part
of
its
proposed
public
interest
determination
forecastex
disagrees
with
the
commission
assertion
that
event
contracts
are
more
susceptible
to
manipulation
when
there
is
no
underlying
cash
market
there
are
three
reasons
for
this
first
event
contract
prices
do
not
impact
the
likelihood
of
the
underlying
event
as
a
result
a
market
participant
trading
an
event
contract
has
no
way
of
altering
or
changing
the
underlying
event
this
substantially
reduces
the
incentive
that
market
participants
have
to
engage
in
manipulation
a
contract
will
still
have
the
same
event
resolution
and
final
settlement
value
of
0
or
1
regardless
of
any
manipulative
activity
that
occurs
in
the
contract
further
because
the
prices
of
an
event
market
without
an
underlying
spot
market
are
not
perfectly
correlated
to
any
particular
financial
instrument
it
becomes
impractical
to
attempt
any
cross
market
manipulation
strategies
where
a
participant
would
attempt
to
change
the
price
of
a
secondary
derivative
or
market
by
manipulating
the
price
of
the
event
contract
second
research
conducted
on
event
contracts
has
demonstrated
that
event
markets
are
not
more
susceptible
to
manipulation
than
other
contracts
studies
of
existing
prediction
markets
have
typically
shown
that
markets
are
difficult
to
manipulate
and
that
the
effects
of
any
manipulation
are
quickly
corrected

this
is
not

that

can
not
occur
in

markets
or
that
the

organizations
should
be
unconcerned
about

in

contradicts
the

view
that

is
more
likely
third

to
prevent

are

patterns
of
manipulative
behavior
can
be
detected
even
in
the
absence
of
an

market
the
strategies
used
by
manipulators
would
not
significantly
change
allowing
self
regulatory
organizations
and
the
cftc
to
effectively
detect
manipulative
activity
predictive
markets
also
have
the
potential
that
actors
who
can
influence
or
have
non
public
information
about
the
outcome
of
the
event
may
attempt
to
participate
in

to

but
this
type
of
activity
can
be
detected
and
prevented
by
using
the
same
techniques
commonly
used
in
the
securities
space
to
prevent
insider
trading
on
stocks
again
the
lack
of
a
cash
market
does
not
make
these
methods
less
effective
dcms
are
well
equipped
to
prevent
manipulative
activity
on
any

market
they
could
list
including
those
without

was
a

concern
that

to
address
excluded
commodities
in
cea
section
would
not
have
contained

congress
determined
that
these

and
many
of
them
including
among
others
gdp
cpi
retail
sales
and
building
permits
do
not
have
an
underlying

the
lack
of
an
underlying

market
should
not
be
considered
a
factor
that
is
against
the
public
interest
in
fact
contracts
without
a
cash
underlying
present
unique
public
interest
benefits
event
contracts
provide
informational
value
as
we
have
previously
demonstrated
if
there
is
no
underlying
cash
market
this
informational
value
increases
as
the
event
contracts
is
then
the
only
market
based
mechanism
for
setting
prices
probabilities
about
the
underlying
event
because
the
event
market
is
filling
gaps
in
available
information
this
is
an
additional
factor
that
should
be
weighed
in
favor
of
an
event
market
without
an
underlying
cash
market
forecastex
believes
that
this
benefit
should
outweigh
any
concerns
of
increased
manipulation
given
the
preceding
points
at
a
minimum
these
factors
will
tend
to
balance
each
other
out
which
again
makes
the
lack
of
an
underlying
cash
market
an
inconsequential
concern
when
determining
if
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
the
commission
harm
to
other
person
standard
is
poorly
defined
the
third
standard
that
the
commission
proposes
to
consider
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
is
whether
the
contract
or
category
of
contracts
could
result
in
market
participants
profiting
from
harm
to
any
person
or
group
of
persons
89
fr
the
commission
bases
this
standard
off
the
colloquy
where
senator
lincoln
noted
that
one
of
the
purposes
of

was
to
prevent
market
participants
from
from
devastating

chairman
dodd
and
i
maintained
this
provision
in
the
conference
report
to
assure
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
futures
and
swaps
markets
that
would
allow
citizens
to
profit
from
devastating
events
and
also
prevent
gambling
through
futures
markets
this
standard
as
articulated
by
the
commission
fundamentally
misunderstands
how
financial
markets
work
and
misinterprets
the
colloquy
between
senators
lincoln
and
feinstein
whether
a
contract
allows
a
person
to
profit
from
harm
to
any
persons
is
an
unworkable
standard
because
every
single
derivatives
contract
in
existence
would
be
implicated
by
it
the
events
that
underlie
event
contracts
as
well
as
other
futures
options
and
swaps
regulated
by
the
cftc
have
substantial
financial
economic
and
monetary
consequences
for
a
wide
variety
of
persons
significant
movement
in
one
direction
or
another
from
these
derivatives
will
almost
always
signal
harm
to
one
group
of
persons
or
another
meaning
that
holders
of
the
derivative
have
the
opportunity
to
profit
off
of
that
harm
for
example
if
the
price
of
oil
rises
dramatically
increasing
the
price
of
oil
futures
millions
of
businesses
and
consumers
will
suffer
harm
from
increased
transportation
and
gasoline
prices
while
holders
of
long
futures
will
profit
conversely
if
the
price
of
oil
drops
dramatically
decreasing
the
price
of
oil
futures
oil
and
gas
businesses
will
suffer
significant
harm
but
holders
of
short
futures
will
profit
a
drop
in
the
500
and
resulting
drop
in
e
mini
futures
gives
participants
the
ability
to
profit
off
of
widespread
economic
damage
weather
derivatives
give
market
participants
the
ability
to
profit
from
a
hurricane
making
landfall
in
a
specific
region
which
can
cause
substantial
physical
and
financial
harm
to
persons
a
similar
story
plays
out
over
virtually
every
derivative
listed
on
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
this
is
also
the
case
in
securities
markets
credit
default
swaps
and
stock
short
sales
also
allow
market
participants
to
profit
when

it

from

as
demonstrated
earlier
in
this
letter
if
a
public
interest
standard
implicates
excluded
commodities
under
cea
section
that
standard
is
contrary
to
congressional
intent
and
should
not
be
used
as
part
of
a
public
interest
review
on
a
fundamental
level
for
a
contract
to
function
as
an
effective
hedge
it
must
be
used
to
mitigate
risk
the
contract
usefulness
as
a
hedge
is
necessarily
dependent
on
the
probability
and
magnitude
of
harm
from
that
risk
this
means
that
for
a
contract
to
serve
effectively
as
a
hedge
a
goal
which
the
cea
recognizes
as
a
public
interest
89
fr
48968
48979
the
contract
must
be
correlated
with
a
risk
that
causes
harm
to
a
person
or
group
of
persons
on
an
even
more
fundamental
level
if
one
participant
profits
from
a
derivatives
contract
another
participant
suffers
a
loss
the
only
way
that
one
can
profit
from
a
derivative
is
if
the
opposing
side
suffers
financial
harm
it
should
not
be
considered
against
the
public
interest
if
a
market
participant
receives
a
profit
from
a
derivative
contract
that
correlates
to
harm
caused
to
a
person
or
group
of
persons
the
perspective
that
the
cftc
should
take
towards
these
sorts
of
situations
is
not
that
market
participants
are
benefitting
from
harm
to
other
persons
but
instead
that
they
are
profiting
from
being
able
to
make
accurate
predictions
and
sharing
that
information
with
the
market
the
informational
value
of
being
able
to
predict
a
negative
outcome
is
just
as
great
if
not
greater
than
the
value
of
predicting
a
positive
one
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
individuals
who
can
accurately
predict
impending
harm
to
persons
or
a
group
of
persons
to
be
incentivized
to
share
that
information
a
contract
which
allows
an
individual
to
profit
when
harm
occurs
to
a
person
or
group
of
persons
is
not
against
the
public
interest
furthermore
the
commission
has
misinterpreted
the
congressional
record
related
to
the
lincoln
colloquy
the
commission
is
making
a
sizeable
jump
from
senator
lincoln
language
related
to
disastrous
events
to
the
much
broader
category
of
harm
to
any
persons
or
group
of
person
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
wanted
the
statute
interpreted
this
broadly
it
appears
unlikely
that
was
congress
intent
given
that
they
recognize
the
value
of
hedging
in
cftc
regulated
markets
a
futures
market
is
for
hedging
156
cong
rec
s5906
07
and
as
demonstrated
previously
any
useful
hedging
contract
will
necessarily
involve
a
participant
profiting
off
of
an
event
that
could
harm
others
additionally
based
on
the
full
context
of
the
colloquy
the
disastrous
events
comment
by
senator
lincoln
appears
to
have
been
a
topline
summary
of
the
conference
report
position
senator
lincoln
elaborates
further
on
this
statement
later
in
the
colloquy
specifically
she
states
national
security
threats
such
as
a
terrorist
attack
war
or
hijacking
pose
a
real
commercial
risk
to
many
businesses
in
america
but
a
futures
contract
that
allowed
people
to
hedge
that
risk
would
also
involve
betting
on
the
likelihood
of
events
that
threaten
our
national
security
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
given
this
elaboration
it
appears
that
her
statement
about
disastrous
events
was
much
more
limited
than
the
cftc
has
interpreted
it
senator
lincoln
elaboration
seems
to
instead
imply
that
the
prohibition
she
is
discussing
is
related
to
the
enumerated
categories
of
terrorism
assassination
and
war
this
more
limited
interpretation
of
the
colloquy
is
superior
because
it
does
not
require
undermining
fundamental
market
principles
finally
the
commission
should
instead
adopt
a
refined
standard
which
is
much
narrower
and
more
specifically
addresses
the
concerns
raised
by
senators
lincoln
and
feinstein
there
is
a
common
thread
between
the
national
security
enumerated
categories
of
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
outcome
of
an
event
contract
involving
any
of
these
three
categories
can
be
altered
by
the
actions
of
a
single
person
or
entity
this
is
problematic
because
it
gives
individuals
an
actionable
financial
incentive
to
attempt
to
change
the
outcome
by
committing
violent
acts
a
terrorist
organization
could
purchase
contracts
about
whether
a
terrorist
attack
will
occur
and
then
execute
just
such
an
attack
giving
them
a
financial
incentive
and
additional
funding
for
pursuing
their
goals
a
sovereign
nation
or
their
agents
could
purchase
contracts
about
whether
or
not
they
will
invade
another
country
and
then
use
the
contracts
to
fund
their
war
effort
such
incentives
are
clearly
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
could
still
recognize
the
potential
damage
that
these
contracts
could
cause
by
adopting
the
following
standard
does
the
contract
create
an
actionable
financial
incentive
for
an
individual
or
entity
to
attempt
to
change
the
outcome
of
the
contract
by
committing
acts
of
violence
or
engaging
in
illegal
activity
this
standard
would
focus
the
commission
review
on
whether
the
contract
would
incentivize
activity
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
standard
contains
the
term
actionable
as
for
an
incentive
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
has
to
be
large
enough
that
it
is
likely
to
change
someone
behavior
a
contract
on
assassination
or
terrorism
creates
an
actionable
incentive
because
one
person
can
change
the
outcome
a
contract
on
the
amount
of
revenue
a
state
receives
from
traffic
light
cameras
does
not
create
an
actionable
incentive
because
even
if
an
individual
attempted
to
influence
outcome
by
incurring
a
massive
number
of
fines
the
financial
penalty
of
the
fines
would
create
a
larger
disincentive
and
even
if
they
incurred
hundreds
of
fines
it
would
be
unlikely
that
their
actions
would
alter
the
total
revenue
to
the
extent
that
it
would
change
the
outcome
of
the
contract
forecastex
also
notes
that
this
analysis
should
apply
to
economic
indicators
as
well
even
though
one
could
argue
that
starting
a
war
or
conducting
a
terrorist
attack
could
potentially
cause
enough
impact
on
an
economy
to
change
the
outcome
of
an
economic
event
contract
those
impacts
would
be
diffuse
and
hard
to
predict
making
it
unlikely
that
this
method
could
be
used
effectively
furthermore
currently
existing
economic
contracts
such
as
the
500
stock
index
could
theoretically
be
used
in
the
same
manner
so
economic
contracts
will
not
be
creating
a
new
incentive
there
is
also
no
evidence
that
entities
have
used
existing
economic
contracts
for
such
purposes
making
it
unlikely
that
these
strategies
would
be
employed
due
to
the
enumerated
category
of
activities
that
are
illegal
under
federal
and
state
law
an
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
even
non
violent
illegal
activity
was
also
incorporated
into
the
standard
the
review
of
whether
an
activity
encourages
illegal
activity
should
be
separate
from
the
analysis
of
whether
a
contract
is
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
under
core
principle
3
the
review
should
not
be
focused
on
whether
market
manipulation
or
insider
trading
is
incentivized
by
the
contract
core
principle
3
reviews
will
adequately
assess
this
question
instead
the
review
should
target
whether
a
non
decisionmaker
could
alter
the
outcome
of
the
event
by
committing
illegal
acts
categorical
bans
are
not
permitted
under
the
cea
the
commission
does
have
the
authority
to
determine
entire

cea

state
that
public
interest
determinations
regarding
event
contracts
involving

activities
may
be
made
categorically
more
specifically
if
congress
intent
was
for
all
products
in
those
categories
to
be
banned
congress
would
have
simply
said
that
all
products
in
those
categories
are
banned
instead
the
statute
states
if
a
product
is
in
a
category
and
they
are
against
the
public
interest
the
cftc
may
ban
them
therefore
congress
did
intend
for
all
the
products
in
the
categories
to
be
banned
to
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent
the
cftc
should
not
issue
a
categorical
ban
on
an
entire
category
of
event
contracts
as
commissioner
mersinger
says
in
her
statement
on
the
proposed

there
is
no
provision
in

for

activities

under

a

the
effect
of
prohibiting
all
contracts
related
to
matters
of
law
many
of
these
potential
contracts
could
have
substantial
public
interest
benefits
the
commission
should
take
the
time
to
evaluate
these
contracts
on
a
case

case
basis
as
opposed
to
instituting
a
poorly
conceived
categorical

the
commission
rationale
for
a
universal

is
flawed
simplistic
and
incomplete
the
commission
makes
several
flawed
arguments
in
support
of
its
proposed
universal
prohibition
on
contracts
involving
unlawful
activity
the
commission
first
notes
that
legislative
bodies
serve
the
public
good
and
establish
the
illegality
of
activity
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
good
89

48981
legislative
bodies
are
intended
to
serve
the
public
good
and
such
bodies
generally
bar
or
prohibit
activity
that
they
recognize
as
causing
or
posing
public
harm
judges
and
judicial
bodies
applying
statutes
and
developing
common
law
also
establish
the
illegality
of
activity
that
is
recognized
as
causing
or
posing
public
harm
this
analysis
even
if
accepted
is
simplistic
and
certainly
not
universally
true
the
commission
is
attempting
to
pass
a
universal
ban
on
a
category
of
products
in
order
to
support
that
ban
the
commission
needs
to
show
that
their
position
is
correct
in
every
case
instead
the
commission
makes
generalized
arguments
which
have
clear
exceptions
and
counter
examples
this
is
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
meaningful
public
policy
and
certainly
not
a
sufficient
basis
for
banning
an
entire
category
of
products
the
commission
additionally
claims
that
permitting
trading
in
contracts
that
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
potentially
in
some
circumstances
creating
opportunities
to
profit
from
illegal
activity
would
undermine
important
state
interests
89
fr
48968
48981
this
argument
as
the
cftc
has
formulated
it
does
not
support
a
universal
ban
the
commission
states
that
contracts
involving
unlawful
activity
potentially
in
some
circumstances
create
a
profit
opportunity
off
of
illegal
activity
necessarily
this
means
that
sometimes
in
other
circumstances
such
a
profit
opportunity
is
not
created
if
by
the
commission
own
admission
public
harm
is
not
universally
created
by
these
contracts
than
a
universal
ban
can
not
be
justified
this
sentiment
was
echoed
by
commissioner
mersinger
in
her
dissent
a
belief
for
which
no
evidence
is
cited
and
that
is
acknowledged
not
to
be
true
across
the
board
can
not
justify
an
absolutist
determination
that
all
event
contracts
involving
an
activity
are
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nor
can
it
justify
a
prohibition
on
trading
all
event
contracts
in
that
category
89
fr
48968
48997
furthermore
the
commission
argument
has
the
same
problem
as
the
harm
standard
they
articulated
earlier
in
their
proposal
such
a
contract
would
only
be
against
the
public
interest
and
would
only
undermine
state
interests
if
it
created
an
actionable
incentive
to
engage
in
the
unlawful
activity
that
was
the
basis
of
the
contract
the
commission
claim
of
this
being
an
issue
of
comity
with
states
has
a
similar
problem
if
persons
are
not
incentivized
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
the
commission
does
not
articulate
any
way
that
state
interests
are
undermined
it
could
be
argued
that
if
an
event
contract
shows
that
state
policies
are
likely
to
have
negative
consequences
or
are
ineffective
that
this
undermines
state
interests
because
it
could
be
embarrassing
to
state
policymakers
even
if
true
this
interest
would
necessarily
be
less
than
the
public
interest
served
by
bringing
information
about
a
state
failure
to
the
public
attention
in
fact
if
there
is
no
actionable
incentive
a
contract
may
support
state
interests
as
the
informational
value
of
the
contracts
could
assist
state
policymakers
having
an
accurate
assessment
of
how
much
illegal
activity
is
likely
to
occur
is
in
the
public
interest
the
commission
can
effectively
assess
whether
a
contract
undermines
state
interests
by
adopting
the
actionable
incentive
standard
we
proposed
in
section
finally
the
commission
claims
that
a
universal
prohibition
prevents
them
from
having
to
serve
as
an
arbiter
of
state
level
public
interest
determinations
89
fr
48968
48981
the
commission
believes
that
a
determination
that
an
event
contract
that
involves
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
which
turns
the
focus
of
the
analysis
to
the
questions
of
whether
the
activity
itself
is
recognized
as
unlawful
and
if
so
whether
the
contract
involves
such
unlawful
activity
eliminates
the
possibility
that
the
commission
would
have
to
serve
in
its
public
interest
analysis
of
a
particular
contract
involving
particular
activity
as
arbiter
of
a
state
own
public
interest
determination
as
expressed
in
statute
common
law
in
recognizing
specific
activity
as
causing
or
posing
public
harm
there
are
two
problems
with
this
assertion
first
prohibiting
all
contracts
related
to
unlawful
activity
necessarily
involves
making
public
interest
determinations
this
is
specifically
stated
by
the
commission
when
they
propose
a
determination
that
all
contracts
related
to
unlawful
activity
are
against

notes
there
are
variations
between
state
laws
by
determining
that
activity
unlawful
under
one
state
law
is
against
the
public
interest
the
commission
is
arbitrating
between
the
states
public
interest
determinations
by
disregarding
the
determination
of
any
other
state
which
has
determined
such
activity
is
lawful
one

this

these
sorts
of
conflicting
public
interest
determinations
by
various
states
make
it
inevitable
that
a
universal
prohibition
will
involve
the
commission
acting
as
an
arbiter
of
states
public
interest
determinations
second
the
commission
can
avoid
acting
as
an
arbiter
by
adopting
the
actionable
financial
incentive
standard
with
this
standard
the
commission
does
not
have
to
rule
whether
a
state
law
is
in
the
public
interest
or
not
instead
it
only
has
to
examine
whether
the
contract
gives
individuals
an
incentive
to
break
those
laws
the
commission
should
abandon
its
proposed
universal
prohibition
and
instead
judge
contracts
that
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
and
state
law
with
the
actionable
financial
incentive
standard
furthermore
the
three
paragraphs
that
the
commission
presented
in
its
proposal
to
support
a
universal
ban
on
contracts
involving
unlawful
activity
contains
such
weak
analysis
that
it
does
not
even
justify
the
prohibition
of
extreme
contracts
related
to
unlawful
activity
take
the
hypothetical
contract
will
the
us
violent
crime
rate
be
above
x
level
in
2025
it
is
not
at
all
clear
how
such
a
contract
would
undermine
state
interests
the
commission
asserts
such
contracts
are
problematic
because
they
create
opportunities
to
profit
from
illegal
activity
89
fr
48981
that
contract
does
not
create
an
actionable
incentive
for
a
person
to
commit
violent
crimes
one
individual
or
entity
does
not
have
sufficient
resources
to
affect
the
violent
crime
rate
in
any
meaningful
way
certainly
not
to
the
extent
that
it
would
create
the
possibility
of
profiting
off
of
the
above
hypothetical
event
contract
by
engaging
in
violence
the
only
other
reasoning
is
that
if
the
contract
creates
the
possibility
of
profiting
off
of
an
illegal
event
whether
or
not
the
contract
creates
an
actual
incentive
to
do
that
event
the
contract
should
be
prohibited
as
has
been
previously
argued
such
a
standard
would
run
counter
to
the
way
that
markets
work
and
would
be
inconsistent
with
how
virtually
every
other
one
of
the
commission
markets
are
regulated
profiting
off
of
harm
to
a
group
of
persons
is
an
essential
feature
of
any
derivatives
contract
as
a
result
the
reasoning
presented
by
the
commission
does
not
articulate
a
single
public
interest
concern
that
would
justify
prohibiting
the
above
contract
in
fact
there
are
significant
public
interest
considerations
that
would
suggest
such
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
event
contracts
are
a
powerful
predictive
tool
that
can
aggregate
diverse
opinions
and
sets
of
information
into
accurate
forecasts
as
we
have
previously
demonstrated
having
accurate
forecasts
about
likely
future
trends
in
violent
crime
is
clearly
in
the
public
interest
and
supports
rather
than
undermines
state
interests
that
information
can
provide
policymakers
with
a
valuable
tool
to
gauge
the
effectiveness
of
current
policy
at
combating
violent
crime
it
appears
likely
that
the
forecasting
value
of
event
contracts
provides
more
of
a
public
good
than
any
public
harm
creating
by
incentivizing
violent
activity
at
the
very
least
contracts
such
as
these
have
a
complex
web
of
public
good
considerations
which
should
be
evaluated
on
a
case
by
case
basis
as
opposed
to
being
subject
to
a
universal
prohibition
this
is
not
to
say
that
every
single
contract
involving
unlawful
activity
is
in
the
public
interest
quite
the
contrary
for
example
a
contract
based
on
the
amount
or
value
of
narcotics
seized
by
the
us
border
patrol
during
a
given
timeframe
could
provide
a
means
for
international
criminal
organizations
to
hedge
against
the
risk
of
more
of
their
narcotics
being
seized
than
they
expect
this
would
certainly
create
an
actionable
incentive
to
engage
in
illicit
activity
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
point
forecastex
is
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
the
topic
of
illegal
activity
is
complex
and
contracts
involving
these
activities
deserve
case
by
case
attention
as
opposed
to
universal
prohibitions
a
categorical
ban
may
lead
to
market
disruption
laws
change
it
is
entirely
possible
that
an
event
contract
when
listed
does
not
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
but
due
to
a
change
in
state
or
federal
legislation
regulation
or
judicial
interpretation
such
activity
becomes
unlawful
during
the
life
of
an
event
contract
this
would
force
a
dcm
or
sef
to
halt
trading
in
existing
contracts
which
could
have
a
disruptive
impact
on
markets
forcing
market
participants
to
pre
maturely
close
their
positions
could
disrupt
their
trading
strategies
and
cause
them
to
take
losses
during
liquidation
not
to
mention
the
difficulties
this
process
would
cause
for
a
registered
entity
attempting
to
implement
this
type
of
change
in
an
orderly
fashion
this
would
be
especially
problematic
in
situations
where
a
law
was
vacated
by
a
federal
court
making
a
contract
involve
unlawful
activity
a
court
decision
could
be
appealed
to
a
higher
court
and
potentially
overturned
situations
could
arise
where
a
district
court
decision
makes
an
activity
illegal
and
thus
makes
event
contracts
related
to
that
activity
prohibited
under
the
cftc
proposal
subsequent
to
the
market
disruption
that
occurs
from
delisting
active
products
an
appeals
court
could
overturn
the
district
court
decision
potentially
creating
further
disruption
the
losers
in
these
situations
will
be
market
participants
who
have
positions
in
these
contracts
the
commission
should
evaluate
contracts
differently
when
a
change
in
law
or
judicial
interpretation
makes
activity
unlawful
the
market
disruption
that
could
occur
from
delisting
actively
traded
contracts
is
a
public
interest
concern
that
should
be
taken
into
account
when
determining
if
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
a
categorical
ban
on
products
involving
unlawful
activity
deprives
the
commission
of
the
needed
flexibility
to
address
delicate
situations
where
the
laws
change
for
example
the
cftc
could
determine
to
allow
the
contracts
that
are
currently
listed
to
remain
listed
until
expiration
while
also
requiring
that
dcms
and
sefs
not
list
any
additional
strikes
or
expirations
of
those
contracts
which
would
dramatically
reduce
any
market
disruption
associated
with
these
types
of
events
case
by
case
analysis
is
the
most
appropriate
course
of
action
the
number
of
listed
contracts
the
liquidity
of
the
listed
contracts
the
open
interest
in
the
listed
contracts
whether
market
participants
roll
their
positions
in
the
listed
markets
into
future
expirations
to
execute
their
risk
management
strategies
and
the
time
to
expiration
of
the
listed
contracts
would
all
be
important
factors
that
should
be
considered
when
examining
the
extent
of
any
potential
market
disruption
because
of
the
wide
degree
of
variability
in
these
factors
a
one
size
fits
all
approach
does
not
appear
appropriate
many
categories
of
contracts
involving
unlawful
activity
are
in
the
public
interest
contracts
involving
activity
that
is
unlawful
in
a
single
or
a
minority
of
states
can
not
be
presumed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
the
commission
correctly
notes
there
are
variations
across
state
law
in
the
specific
actions
that
are
recognized
as
unlawful
89
fr
48981
due
to
this
variation
many
activities
that
would
be
recognized
as
lawful
in
one
jurisdiction
would
be
unlawful
in
another
jurisdiction
this
is
of
particular
concern
when
dealing
with
the
variations
in
business
regulation
licensing
labor
laws
and
the
sale
of
goods
in
these
circumstances
a
total
ban
on
event
contracts
involving
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
will
have
much
more
far
reaching
consequences
than
the
commission
likely
intends
for
example
many
contracts
related
to
economic
transactions
would
be
considered
to
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law

due

wide
variety

available
at
this
has
resulted
in
a
vast
number
of
consumer
products
being
required
to
have
prop
65
notices
in
order
to
comply
with
california
law
in
other
states
these
warnings
are
not
required
and
thus
typically
not
affixed
to
goods
this
makes
the
majority
of
goods
sold
in
the
49
states
outside
of
california
unlawful
under
california
state
law
because
the
goods
do
not
have
the
appropriate
prop
65
warning
labels
as
a
result
it
could
easily
be
determined
that
any
contracts
dealing
with
the
sale
of
consumer
goods
generally
or
any
particular
consumer
good
california
lists
products
that
are
typically
required
to
have
prop
65
warnings
these
include
food
products
vehicles
petroleum
products
gas
stations
and
rental
properties
among
others
on
a
national
level
involves
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
since
those
sales
would
violate
california
prop
65
such
contracts
could
serve
clear
hedging
and
price
basing
functions
further
such
contracts
would
not
create
an
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
acts
or
allow
market
participants
to
profit
from
illegal
activities
any
reasoned
public
interest
analysis
would
not
find
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
second
issue
with
a
universal
prohibition
on
contracts
involving
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
is
that
it
effectively
empowers
state
governments
to
dictate
national
policy
the
commission
suggests
that
if
an
activity
is
unlawful
in
some
states
but
not
others
the
cftc
will
automatically
through
its
categorical
prohibition
ban
trading
in
event
contracts
related
to
that
activity
the
decision
of
one
state
government
will
limit
the
types
of
financial
transactions
that
citizens
of
all
50
states
will
be
able
to
participate
in
this
upsets
the
balance
and
separation
of
powers
between
federal
and
state
lawmakers
the
government
of
florida
should
not
be
able
to
determine
what
kinds
of
financial
products
residents
of
new
york
can
trade
and
vice
versa
in
an
extreme
example
a
single
state
passes
a
law
which
determined
that
the
risking
or
staking
of
money
upon
events
related
to
weather
or
climate
is
illegal
under
the
cftc
proposal
the
state
would
effectively
be
setting
national
policy
by
taking
advantage
of
the
cftc
universal
prohibition
to
prohibit
all
contracts
related
to
weather
and
climate
nationally
in
keeping
with
previous
points
forecastex
is
not
arguing
that
all
contracts
involving
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
should
be
determined
to
be
in
the
public
interest
instead
the
commission
should
recognize
that
the
intricacies
of
overlapping
and
competing
state
laws
are
a
complicated
topic
not
suited
for
universal
prohibitions
whether
or
not
a
contract
involving
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
be
determined
on
a
case
by
case
basis
contracts
which
depend
on
legislative
and
judicial
determinations
of
legality
should
be
considered
to
be
in
the
public
interest
under
the
broad
category
of
contracts
involving
activity
that
is
unlawful
there
is
a
sub
category
of
products
which
should
generally
be
determined
to
be
in
the
public
interest
contracts
which
revolve
around
the
decisions
of
legislative
and
judicial
bodies
about
the
legality
of
certain
actions
examples
of
contracts
in
this
category
could
include
i
will
new
hampshire
pass
a
right
to
work
law
before
the
end
of
2025
ii
will
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
overturn
the
protecting
americans
from
foreign
adversary
controlled
applications
act
iii
will
congress
pass
a
law
providing
a
path
to
citizenship
for
undocumented
workers
by
the
end
of
2025
iv
will
at
least
25
states
allow
abortion
through
the
end
of
the
second
trimester
by
december
2026
v
will
the
dc
circuit
court
of
appeals
determine
that
google
violated
anti
trust
laws
in
usa
google
llc
vi
will
congress
pass
an
assault
weapons
ban
by
the
end
of
2025
such
contracts
would
likely
be
considered
to
involve
unlawful
activity
because
they
deal
with
activity
that
is
currently
unlawful
or
will
be
unlawful
depending
on
the
resolution
of
the
contract
as
previously
noted
to
work
laws
make
it
unlawful
for
labor
agreements
to
require
the
payment
of
union
dues
by
non
union
employees
the
protecting
americans
from
foreign
adversary
controlled
applications
act
determines
that
tik
tok

be
sold
or
cease
operations
in
the
united
states
undocumented

broken
us
immigration
laws
by
entering
the
country
illegally
abortion
is
banned
in
a
number
of
us
states
usa
google
llc
turns
on
the
question
of
whether
google
committed
unlawful
activity
an
assault
weapons
ban
would
make
the
possession
of
assault
weapons
unlawful
these
contracts
do
not
raise
the
same
concerns
as
contracts
that
the
commission
is
looking
to
prohibit
contracts
on
whether
a
legislative
body
will
take
a
given
action
do
not
give
market
participants
an
actionable
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
note
that
it
could
be
argued
that
such
contracts
create
an
incentive
for
decisionmakers
to
alter
the
outcome
of
the
contract
however
as
long
as
a
registered
entity
prohibits
the
participation
of
decisionmakers
see
for
example
forecastex
rule
509
such
a
contract
should
not
be
more
likely
to
result
in
illegal
activity
similar
protections
that
exist
in
securities
markets
to
prevent
insider
trading
can
be
applied
to
these
markets
if
such
protections
are
in
place
it
is
unlikely
that
decisionmakers
who
can
affect
the
outcome
would
be
able
to
profit
by
trading
the
contracts
and
altering
their
votes
to
influence
the
outcome
further
market
participants
do
not
even
profit
off
of
any
unlawful
activity
with
these
contracts
as
they
do
not
turn
on
the
amount
of
unlawful
activity
but
simply
whether
an
activity
will
be
unlawful
or
not
there
is
no
state
interest
that
is
harmed
by
the
listing
of
these
contracts
furthermore
such
contracts
are
highly
likely
to
create
positive
public
interest
benefits
legislative
acts
can
have
significant
impacts
on

weaknesses
that
the

raised
related

contracts
in

kalshi

the
commission
argued
that
election
contracts
based
on
the
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
could
not
be
effectively
used
as
a
hedging
vehicle
because
an
election
outcome
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
a
policy
will
be
implemented
meaning
that
the
economic
consequences
of
an

are
unpredictable
kalshi
order

whereas
the
commission
finds
that
while
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
may
ultimately
have
economic
effects
those
eventual
economic
effects
are
both
diffuse
and
unpredictable
while
the
likelihood
of
adoption
of
a
given
policy
may
increase
or
decrease
based
on
the
composition
of
congress
many
intervening
events
and
variables
exist
between
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
and
the
actual
implementation
of
such
a
policy
in
contrast
contracts
based
on
whether
or
not
a
specific
action
is
legalized
do
have
predictable
economic
consequences
as
they
directly
concern
whether
specific
policies
are
enacted
the
contracts
additionally
do
not
impact
the
integrity
of
elections
and
could
not
be
used
to
manipulate
a
legislative
process
as
the
value
of
the
contracts
does
not
determine
how
a
legislature
will
act
as
long
as
a
dcm
or
sef
has
appropriate
protections
in
place
to
prevent
insider
trading
and
market
manipulation
such
contracts
would
not
pose
different
concerns
than
any
other
event
contract
as
a
result
the
commission
should
consider
event
contracts
related
to
whether
or
not
legislative
or
legal
decisions
make
an
activity
unlawful
to
be
generally
in
the
public
interest
at
minimum
since
the
public
interest
rationale
articulated
by
the
commission
does
not
apply
to
this
type
of

they
should
not
be
subject
to

universal
prohibition
and
instead
evaluated
on
a

basis
contracts
related
to
societal
trends
should
not
universally
be
considered
contrary
to
the
public

finally
forecastex
believes
that
there
are
a
number
of
potential
contracts
related

unlawful

that
are
in
the
public
interest
because
of
the
valuable

they

one

contracts
on
these

would
not
raise
the

concerns
the
commission
articulates
an
individual
would
not
be
incentivized
to
illegally
immigrate
to
the

because
of
such
a
contract
for
example
in

there
were

one
additional
person
or
even
an
additional
family
group
immigrating
would
have
a
negligible
impact
on

this
means
an
individual
could
not
change
the
outcome
of
the
contract
in
any
meaningful
way
and
thus
would
not
be
incentivized
to
engage
in
illegal

predictive
contracts

for

would
thus
provide
consumers

with
valuable
forward
looking
information
additionally
immigration
has
become
one
of
the
most
controversial
topics
in
the
american
political
sphere
instead
of
politically
charged
rhetoric
such
contracts
would
provide
an
un
biased
and
market
based
mechanism
of
viewing
and
understanding
the
complex
issues
surrounding
the
topic
which
should
strengthen
the
democratic
process
by
improving
public
discourse
and
analysis
as
well
as
providing
a
useful
tool
for
policymakers
immigration
is
not
the
only
topic
that
falls
into
this
category
topics
ranging
from

control
abortion
suicide
and
fentanyl
overdoses
have
substantial
economic
and
social
consequences
and
are
the
center
of
often
heated
political
debates
contracts
on
these
topics
would
involve
unlawful
activity
but
would
not
provide
an
incentive
to
engage
in
illegal
activity
they
would
however
be

tool

about

ibid
columbia

such
topics
require
individualized
and
nuanced
discussions
of

not
a

the
commission
should
abandon
its
proposed
universal
prohibition
and
instead
adopt
the
standard
of
actionable
financial
incentives
to
determine
if
contracts
involving
unlawful
activity
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
will
provide
a
clear
standard
for
judging
these
contracts
that
is
readily
understandable
to
both
the
commission
and
regulated
entities
in
fact
this
will
likely
reduce
the
number
of
reviews
related
to
this
enumerated
category
that
the
commission
will
have
to
perform
as
the
cftc
and
regulated

will
be
on
the

to
which

are
allowed
as
opposed

the

proposed

gaming
contracts
should
not
be

the
commission
included

definition
there
are
many
contracts
that
could
be
defined
as
gaming
that
should
not
be
subject
to

the

in

with
one
or
more
contests

89

this
greatly
expands
the
category
of
gaming
and
would
likely
include
many
contracts
that
have
legitimate
hedging
and
price
basing
potential
most
notably
contracts
related
to
the
economics
of
the
sports
sector
including
contracts
on

construction
and

costs
as
well
as

related

and
growth
of
the
sports
betting
industry
these
contracts
all
involve
occurrences
or
non
occurrences
in
connection
with
games
but
such
contracts
are
not
likely
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
these
contracts
are
focused
on
the
economics
of
the
sports
industry
there
are
valuable
hedging
and

functions
for
these

contracts
on
team

league
revenues
would
have
clear
hedging
value
for

help
assess
the
value
of

the
sports
betting
industry
is
one
of
the
fastest
growing
industries
in
the
country
contracts
on
the
growth
of
this
industry
could
provide
a
wealth
of
informational
value
for
individuals
as
well
as
state
policymakers
considering
whether
further
regulations
on
the
industry
might
be
necessary
furthermore
none
of
these
contracts
would
be
construed
as
purely
gambling
as
none
of
them
involve
betting
on
the
outcome
or
performance
of
players
in
a
game
the
rationale
that
the
commission
forwarded
in
their
proposal
for
making
a
categorical
determination
would
not
apply
to
this
type
of
contract
the
sports

entertainment
sectors
are
important
pieces
of
the
economy
similar
contracts
related
to
other
sectors
of
the
economy
would
not
be
prohibited
the
cftc
should
not
prohibit
similar
contracts
for
the
entertainment
industry
simply
because
it
does
not
want
to
do
the
work
of
evaluating
contracts
on
a
case
by
case
basis
at
minimum
if
the
cftc
adopts
their
proposed
definition

recognize
that
a
contract
specific
approach
to
making
public
interest
determinations
regarding
event
contracts
may
be
difficult
and
resource
intensive
for
the
cftc
but
aside
from
my
view
that
a
contract
specific
approach
is
required
by
the
cea
it
also
is
a
better
approach
from
a
policy
perspective
precisely
because
it
would
permit
the
cftc
to
consider
these
practical
questions
in
the
context
of
the
specific
circumstances
applicable
to
a
particular

we
do
not
get
to
override
a
requirement
under

it
will
be

furthermore
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
absent
universal
prohibitions
that
the
commission
will
be
required
to
undertake
an
excessively
large
number
of
contract
reviews
as
noted
by

this

inefficiency
even
if
the

rises

this
initial
increase
should
not
be

to
persist
as

the

will
not

intensive

the
path
that
the

is
currently
pursuing
in

broad

vaguely

will
likely
lead

an
increased

number
of

with

could
potentially
implicate
any

it
becomes
inevitable
that
the
commission
view
of
where
the
enumerated
categories
end
will
differ
from
that
of
dcms
and
sefs
the

proposal
will
require
more

not
less
the
commission
should
primarily
rely
on
its
authority

consistent
with

the

should
not
be
looking
to
promulgate
a
broad
interpretation
of

to
support

texas

the
cftc
should
clarify
that
macroeconomic
measures
and
indexes
are
not
limited
to
measures
of
the
united
states
economy
similar
measures
of
foreign
nations
should
also
be
considered
macroeconomic
measures
all
of
the
examples
contained
within
the
commission
illustrative
examples
of
contracts
not
within
the
scope
of
cftc
regulation
are
measurements
of
the
us
economy
cea
section
does
not
distinguish
between
us
macroeconomic
measures
and
the
macroeconomic
measures
of
foreign
economies
so
the
cftc
should
not
either
forecastex
notes
that
if
the
reporting
in
a
foreign
nation
is
unreliable
or
if
the
cftc
lacks
a
memorandum
of
understanding
a
dcm
may
have
a
substantially
higher
burden
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
a
macroeconomic
contract
on
a
foreign
country
meets
the
requirements
of
cftc
regulation

subpart

and
is
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
this
however
is
a
separate
issue
from
whether
such
a
contract
should
be
considered
to
fall
under
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
for
the
purposes
of
cftc
regulation
finally
forecastex
believes
that
there
is
an
additional
category
which
the
commission
should
add
to
the
list
of
excluded
commodities
fiscal
and
monetary
policy
measures
some
monetary
policy
measures
like
the
federal
funds
rate
are
already
included
as
financial
indicators
within
the
commission
proposal
forecastex
would
like
to
see
any
monetary
policy
measures
that
are
not
considered
financial
indicators
to
be
included
as
their
own
category
monetary
policy
measures
include
items
like
policy
interest
rates
reserve
requirements
and
quantitative
easing
fiscal
policy
measures
include
items
such
as
government
spending
tax
rates
and
measures
of
government
debt
monetary
and
fiscal
policy
measures
should
be
considered
macroeconomic

and
specifically

these
policies
are
the
primary
levers
by
which
a
government
influences

as
a

these

as
a
result
these
important

should
be

the

may
determine
based
upon
a
review
of
the
terms
or
conditions
of
a
submission
made

a

an

involve
an

enumerated
in
paragraphs

2
of
this
section
and
is
subject
to
a

review
additionally
the
cftc
will
request
that

the

subject

forecastex
believes
this
provision
can
be
improved
if
the
commission
initiates
a
90
day
review
on
contracts
that
have
already
begun
to
trade
this
would
lead
to
market
disruption
and
has
the
potential
to
harm
customers
whose
strategies
may
involve
exiting
their
positions
prior
to
expiration
instead
if
the
commission
initiates
a
90
day
review
on
a
product
that
has
already
begun
to
trade
the
commission
should
instead
require
the
registered
entity
to
place
the
contract
into
a
closing
only
state
so
that
market
participants
who
have
a
position
in
the
contract
under
review
still
have
the
opportunity
to
exit
their
positions
if
they
so
choose
ix
conclusion
event
contracts
are
much
more
than
contracts
related
to

event
contracts
show
great
promise

information
aggregation

management

the
commission
should
be
encouraging
innovation
in
this
space
given
the
public
interest
benefits
it
promises
by
providing
a
clear
and
consistent
regulatory
framework
the
commission
proposal
currently
fails
to
do
that
by
adopting
the
revisions
that
forecastex
has
proposed
the
commission
can
improve
their
regulation
of
event
markets
and
avoid
doing
widespread
damage
to
this
burgeoning
field
of
products
forecastex
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
cftc
proposal
and
is
available

provide
further
input
