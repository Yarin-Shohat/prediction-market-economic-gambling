summary
of
argument
the
cftc
erred
in
holding
that
political
event
contracts
involve
gaming
gaming
refers
to
playing
games
like
roulette
or
the
slots
or
betting
on
the
outcome
of
games
such
as
the
super
bowl
but
elections
are
not
games
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
statute
the
cftc
failed
to
apply
the
appropriate
canons
of
statutory
construction
when
it
reasoned
that
because
an
election
is
a
type
of
contest
participating
in
political
event
prediction
markets
must
be
gaming
that
logic
leads
to
irrational
and
unsustainable
interpretations
of
the
statute
the
cftc
policy
views
on
prediction
markets
whatever
their
merit
do
not
authorize
the
cftc
to
take
statutory
interpretation
into
its
own
hands
the

same
but
whatever
the
outcome
of
those
pending
cases
the
cftc
interpretation
of
gaming
is
so
irreconcilable
with
the
statute
plain
text
and
purpose
that
it
clearly
can
not
stand
the
cftc
public
interest
analysis
is
also
fatally
flawed
the
proposed
contracts
serve
an
empirically
supportable
hedging
function
and
the
cftc
analysis
of
the
utility
of
hedging
was
far
too
narrow
it
also
failed
to
recognize
the
non
economic
benefits
of
prediction
markets
finally
the
cftc
concluded
that
kalshiex
prediction
markets
might
lead
to
election
manipulation
but
it
failed
to
explain
why
it
reached
that
conclusion
in
the
face
of
abundant
contrary
evidence
the
cftc
reasoning
is
especially
troubling
because
it
can
extend
to
many
prediction
markets
that
are
not
related
to
elections
thus
causing
a
major
and
unwarranted
expansion
of
the
cftc
regulatory
authority
in
a
manner
that
would
contrary
to
the
statute
plain
text
cause
multitudes
of
event
contracts
to
be
forbidden
by
the
agency
argument
the
cftc
interpretation
of
gaming
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
the
cftc
concluded
that
political
event
contracts
involve
gaming
within
the
meaning
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
thus
authorizing
the
cftc
to
ban
them
indeed
the
cftc
decision
to
reject
the
proposed
contract
hinges
critically
on
the
determination
that
the
proposed
election
contract
involves
a
game
if
an
election
is
not
a
game
or
does
not
involve
a
game
the
cftc
has
no
statutory
basis
upon
which
to
reject
the
contract
the
definition
of
gaming
and
of
the
term
involve
is
thus
outcome
dispositive
but
here
the
cftc
decision
misreads
the
statute
and
gives
the
cftc
arbitrary
and
unrestrained
authority
far
exceeding
the
act
intended
scope
the
cftc
logic
violates
the
presumption
of
consistent
usage
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
the
cftc
may
determine
that
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
event
contracts
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
the
cftc
concluded
that
it
had
authority
to
ban
kalshiex
proposed
political
event
contracts
because
they
involve
gaming
as
kalshiex
correctly
argues
the
cftc
statutory
analysis
is
wrong
an
event
contract
involves
an
activity
only
if
the
underlying
event
constitutes
that
activity
for
example
an
event
contract
involves
terrorism
assassination
or
war
if
the
event
underlying
the
event
contract
is
terrorism
assassination
or
war
the
cftc
however
did
not
assess
whether
the
event
underlying
kalshiex
contracts
constituted
gaming
instead
the
cftc
assessed
whether
the
act
of
trading
kalshiex
contracts
would
be
gaming
that
reasoning
is
wrong
as
justice
scalia
explained
a
word
or
phrase
is
presumed
to
bear
the

meaning
throughout

presumption

sense
when
applied

as

286

the
cftc
statutory
analysis
however
violates
this
canon
the
cftc
analysis
requires
that
the
word
involve
mean
one
thing
with
respect
to
7
iii
and
iv
contracts
that
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
and
something
entirely
different
with
respect
to
contracts
that
involve
gaming
in
subsections
ii
ii
and
iv
a
contract
involves
terrorism
assassination
or
war
if
the
underlying
event
is
or
relates
to
terrorism
assassination
or
war
but
in
subsection
v
under
the
cftc
reading
a
contract
involves
gaming
if
the
act
of
buying
or
selling
the
contract
is
itself
gaming
the
cftc
interpretation
of
the
word
involve
as
bearing
two
totally
different
meanings
within
the
same
sentence
is
untenable
under
the
presumption
of
consistent
usage
and
defies
common
logic
this
error
is
an
independent
and
sufficient
cause
to
grant
plaintiff
motion
for
summary
judgment
elections
are
not
games
and
trading
political
event
contracts
is
not
gaming
even
if
the
cftc
was
correct
that
it
has
the
authority
to
regulate
gaming
it
would
still
lack
authority
to
ban
kalshiex
prediction
markets
because
participating
in
those
markets
is
not
gaming
contrary
to
the
cftc
view
having
a
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
a
future
event
and
playing
a
game
are
not
the
same
thing
more
to
the
point
congressional
elections
are
not
games
and
contracts
indexed
to
the
outcomes
of
those
elections
are
also
not
games
and
do
not
involve
games
gaming
means
playing
a
game
it
is
what
people
do
at
a
casino
or
during
their
weekly
poker
night
when
people
play
roulette
or
the
slots
they
are
gaming
likewise
people
who
bet
on
games
like
people
who
go
to
a
casino
and
put
down
money
on
the
super
bowl
might
be
said
to
engage
in
gaming
but
an
election
is
not
a
game
and
putting
down
money
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
is
not
gaming
of

every
person
who
purchases
a
political
event
contract
has
a
financial
stake
in
the
outcome
of
a
future
event
and
often
the
person
does
so
for
purposes
unrelated
to
hedging
but
that
is
true
for
all
financial
markets
whether
derivative
or
not
a
retail
investor
who
purchases
apple
stock
or
options
on
apple
stock
or
an
sp500
mini
contract
is
not
hedging
any
risk
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
investor
is
gaming
or
involved
in
a
game
if
that
were
true
a
huge
swath
of
financial
contracts
that
have
been
blessed
for
decades
by
the
cftc
would
have
to
be
prohibited
the
commission
logic
on
this
point
is
dramatically
overbroad
and
proves
far
far
too
much
this
is
an
additional
independent
reason

must
fail

is

is

place
where

with

meet
to
trade
attempting
to

or
in
this
case
of
the
probability
of
an

coming
to

the
participation
of
these
non

investors
can
thus
improve
market
performance
not
detract
from
it
the
cftc
also
offered
no
persuasive
explanation
of
how
gaming
could
be
transmuted
to
all
event
contracts
where
the
underlying
event
involves
people
contesting
something
the
cftc
reasoning
is
as
follows
1
some
dictionaries
equate
gaming
with
gambling
and
2
most
state
laws
gambling
involves
a
person
staking
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
game
contest
or
contingent
event
order
at
8
amp

order
the
cftc
also
pointed
to
a
federal
statute
defining
bet
or
wager
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
a
sporting
event
or
a
game
subject
to
chance
order
at
9
this
reasoning
fails
at
multiple
levels
the
fact
that
some
dictionaries
use
gambling
and
gaming
in
the
same
breath
does
not
imply
that
broad
statutory
definitions
of
gambling
always
mean
the
same
thing
as
gaming
dictionaries
commonly
include
multiple
definitions
of
each
term

observation
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
terms
are
not
synonymous

likewise
a
federal
statute
defining
bet
or
wager
sheds
little
light
on
what
the
word
gaming
means
indeed
it
would
be
absurd
if
gaming
stretched
as
broadly
as
the
statutes
cited
by
the
cftc
to
the
extent
the
cftc
believes
that
staking
something
of
value
upon
the
contingent
event
order
at
is
enough
to
make
an
activity
gaming
all
derivatives
markets
would
constitute
gaming
and
therefore
be
illegal
and
the
cftc
would
put
itself
out
of
business
anyone
who
buys
wheat
futures
is
staking
something
of
money
on
a
contingent
increase
or
decrease
in
the
cost
of
wheat
in
the
future
by
the
cftc
logic
they
are
involved
in
a
corn
game
that
can
not
be
permitted
on
an
approved
contract
market
the
contradiction
is
obvious
recognizing
the
absurdity
of
this
position
the
cftc
suggested
that
its
decision
might
be
limited
to
prediction
markets
for
elections
because
an
election
is
a
type
of
contest
see
order
at
9
to
bet
or
wager
on
elections
is
to
stake
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
contests
or
others
namely
contests
between
electoral
candidates
i
at
10
to
take
a
position
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
to
stake
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
since
the
congressional
control
contracts
are
premised
on
the
outcome
of
contests
between
electoral
candidates
which
ultimately
determine
the
party
affiliation
of
the
speaker
and
the
pres
pro
temp
according
to
the
cftc
limiting
gaming
to
contests
would
draw
the
appropriate
line
because
futures
contracts
traditionally
have
not
been
premised
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
at
10
this
reasoning
again
fails
and
is
also
dramatically
overbroad
even
if
an
election
campaign
might
in
some
sense
be
said
to
be
a
contest
that
does
not
mean
that
purchasing
political
event
contracts
is
gaming
whether
something
is
gaming
turns
on
whether
it
involves
playing
a
game
not
on
whether
the
event
underlying
the
event
contract
is
a
contest
moreover
a
substantial
literature
characterizes
the
outcome
of
market
processes
as
equivalent
to
the
results
of
elections
in
which
market
participants
vote
with
currency
on
a
weighted
voting
basis
rather
than
through
a
one
person
one
vote
mechanism
put
another
way
every
market
can
be
reframed
as
a
weighted
voting
process
or
as
a
contest
between
buyers
who
want
lower
prices
and
sellers
who
want
higher
prices

where
to
set

in

thus
if
every
market
is
also
a
game
and
the
commission
offers
no
principled
basis
upon
which
to
conclude
otherwise
then
no
derivative
on
any
market
could
be
approved
under
the
commission
logic
because
every
derivative
would
involve
gaming
again
this
interpretation
of
the
statute
makes
no
sense
because
it
would
negate
the
very
existence
of
the
markets
that
the
statute
is
designed
to
regulate
but
the
agency
provides
no
rational
basis
to
prevent
that
interpretation
from
being
applied
to
every
market
process
the
agency
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
is
thus
unreasonable
at
best
and
irrational
at
worst
the
state
statutes
cited
by
the
cftc
also
fail
to
support
its
position
at
most
those
statutes
show
that
the
word
gambling
can
refer
to
betting
on
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
a
contest
which
in
context
is
something
similar
to
a
game
so
if
one
bets
on
the
outcome
of
the
super

the
olympic
100
meter
dash
which
might
not
qualify
as
a
game
but
is
a
type
of
one
is
engaging
in
gambling
these
statutes
do
not
show
that
gaming
encompasses
betting
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
and
certainly
do
not
show
that
gaming
encompasses
participating
in
a
political
prediction
market
indeed
these
statutes
are
irrelevant
multiple
times
over
they
distinguish
between
game
and
contest
distinguish
between
underlying
event
such
as
a
football
act
of
betting
money
which
the
cftc
is
referring
to
as
gaming
and
say
nothing
about
whether
contest
encompasses
elections
under
the
cftc
view
playing
craps

poker
blackjack
rummy
and
mah
jongg
and
entering
into
positions
in
political
event
prediction
markets
are
all
first
six
because
they
involve
actual
gaming
and
the
seventh
because
the
underlying
event
in
the
event
contract
involves
a
kind
of
competition
meanwhile
under
the
cftc
view
markets
that
involve
predicting
anything
that
is
a
congress

enact
immigration

whether
the
supreme
court
will
overrule
chevron
whether
there
will
be
1
million
new
covid
cases
or
anything
else
are
not
gaming
because
the
underlying
events
are
not
competitive
it
is
simply
impossible
to
wring
this
line
from
the
word
gaming
an
event
contract
turning
on
whether
a
candidate
will
win
an
election
which
the
cftc
thinks
is
gaming
is
clearly
more
similar
to
an
event
contract
turning
on
whether
congress
will
pass
a
particular
statute
which
is
not
gaming
under
the
cftc
view
than
it
is
to
mah
jongg
further
the
cftc
interpretation
of
gaming
would
appear
to
encompass
any
event
contract
turning
on
the
outcome
of
a
process
that
involves
competition
which
could
give
that
term
an
unexpectedly
broad
scope
for
example
the
business

is
sharply
competitive
would
prediction
markets
turning
on
for
example
which
company
would
be
the
market
leader
in
a
particular
area
constitute
gaming
because
companies
compete
against
each
other
the
cftc
engaged
in
policy
analysis
not
statutory
construction
the
cftc
also
took
the
view
that
the
economic
impacts
of
the
outcome
of
contests
for
congressional
control
are
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
serve
the
hedging
and
risk
management
functions
that
futures
contracts
have
traditionally
been
intended
to
serve

as

professor

with

assessment
of
the

but
even
setting
the

the
cftc
analysis
does
not
support
its
statutory
interpretation
of
gaming
whether
an

is
a
type

standard
invented
by
the

has
little
to

with

the
cftc

deny
the

whether
congress
would

yet
even
under
the
cftc
view
such
a

market
would
not
count
as

the
cftc
should
have
interpreted

as
written
rather
than
rewriting
it
to
conform
to
its
policy
views
on
the

proposed

the

there

by

here

the
cftc
committed
three
errors
of

it
adopted
an
arbitrary
and
unsupported
view
of
what
hedging
means
and
as
a
result
ignored
the
proposed
contracts
legitimate
hedging
purposes
it
ignored
the
fundamental
point
that
the
public
interest
goes
beyond
hedging
it
did
not
explain
why
it
rejected
the
empirical
evidence
offered
by
kalshiex
and
its
supporters
the
proposed
contracts
serve
legitimate
hedging
purposes
first
the
cftc
was
dead
wrong
on
what
qualifies
as
hedging
utility
the
cftc
acknowledged
that
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
could
following
a
number
of
independent
intervening
events
generally
affect
a
wide
variety
of
personal
liabilities
and
economic
factors
order
at
17
but
in
the
cftc
view
that
does
not
establish
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
can
be
used
for
specific
identifiable
hedging
purposes
and
thus
does
not
establish
the
hedging
utility
of
the
congressional
control
contracts
thus
according
to
the
cftc
an
event
contract
has
hedging
utility
only
if
it
can
be
used
for
specific
identifiable
hedging
purposes
as
a
matter
of
basic
economics
this
reasoning
is
indefensible
a
political
event
contract
plainly
can
be
used
for
specific
identifiable
hedging
purposes
financial
market
participants
routinely
consider
the
probability
of
a
particular
candidate
winning
an
election
to
accurately
price
assets
it
is
inevitable
that
some
businesses
benefit
when
republicans
are
in
charge
and
other
businesses
benefit
when
democrats
are
in
charge
as
those
probabilities
change
the
value
of
the
assets
change
for
this
reason
political
event
contracts
have
bona
fide
hedging
utility
they
reduce
a
company
exposure
to
the
risk
associated
with
a
particular
candidate
winning
suppose
a
company
knows
that
if
one
candidate
wins
it
will
likely
be
able
to
drill
for
oil
on
a
particular
piece
of
land
and
if
that
candidate
loses
it
likely
will
not
the
company
value
may
swing
dramatically
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
election
making
it
prudent
to
purchase
a
political
event
contract
as
a
hedge
that
hedging
purpose
is
both
specific
and
identifiable
indeed
significant
economic
research
confirms
that
outcomes
of

have

there

increase

and
make

the

ignored
all
of

it
concluded

because
prediction

can
not
be
used
for

a
conclusion
that
was
itself

must
be

the
cftc
stated
in

that
it

by
kalshi

commenters
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
serve
as
a
check
on

the
cftc
also
seems
to
have
ignored
the
observation
that
if
a
person
seeks
to
manipulate
election
outcomes
manipulating
the
event
market
would
be
a
foolish
mechanism
by
which
to
achieve
that
result
first
off
traders
in
this
market
must
identify
themselves
to
intermediaries
and
therefore
can
not
remain
hidden
manipulators
do
not
rationally
gravitate
to
markets
that
mandate
this
level
of
transparency
second
contributing
to
dark
money
pools
that
can
purchase
advertising
and
engage
in
other
forms
of
influence
would
likely
be
far
more
efficient
in
influencing
outcomes
than
attempting
to
influence
event
contract
prices
third
markets
can
be
self
correcting
if
a
manipulator
tries
to
inflate
the
prices
of
a
democratic
or
republican
victory
the
manipulator
will
only
attract
traders
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
dark
money
contributions
have
no
equivalent
offsetting
mechanisms
because
they
are
by
definition
hidden
and
dark
and
do
not
operate
in
markets
that
allow
for
the
formation
of
offsetting
positions
the
risk
of
manipulation
is
thus
rationally
analyzed
as
a
comparative
phenomenon
from
that
perspective
the
proposed
contract
is
highly
unlikely
to
contribute
to
electoral
manipulation
precisely
because
of
the
existence
of
alternative
superior
methods
of
manipulation
indeed
if
anything
the
self
correcting
nature
of
the
contract
suggests
that
it
is
more
likely
to
have
an
antimanipulative
effect
the
cftc
showed
no
signs
of
giving
meaningful
consideration
to
any
of
these
noneconomic
benefits
affirming
that
reasoning
is
particularly
troubling
because
it
would
allow
the
agency
to
apply
that
approach
to
any
prediction
market
not
just
congressional
control
contracts
the
court
should
not
allow
the
cftc
to
extinguish
based
on
incomplete
and
unexplained
reasoning
a
tool
of
great
potential
social
and
academic
value
the
order
fails
to
adequately
explain
its
concerns
regarding
manipulation
third
the
cftc
did
not
adequately
explain
its
conclusions
regarding
the
risk
of
manipulation
as
professor
grundfest
and
other
commenters
explained
to
the
cftc
several
studies
of
existing
prediction
markets
have
shown
that
price
pump
attempts
are
short
lived
and
as
explained
above
disciplined
by
the
market
self
correcting
mechanisms
moreover
the
relatively
low
position
limit
means
any
one
participant
is
unlikely
to
be
able
to
move
the
market
in
a
meaningful
way
as
traders
enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
to
profit
from
the
mispricing
as
for
concerns
about
manipulation
of
elections
commenters
offered
abundant
empirical
and
theoretical
evidence
suggesting
it
would
not
occur
of
course
the
cftc
as
an
expert
administrative
agency
was
free
to
review
the
evidence
and
make
a
predictive
judgment
as
to
the
risk
of
manipulation
but
it
gave
no
sign
of
having
actually
made
such
a
predictive
judgment
the
cftc
observed
is
also
research
suggesting
that
election
markets
may
incentivize
the
creation
of
fake
or
unreliable
information
in
the
interest
of
moving
the
market
and
a
number
of
commenters
also
raised
this
concern
order
at
22
but
there
also
is
research
showing
that
election
markets
would
decrease
misinformation
as
the
cftc
acknowledged
at
21
with
conflicting
evidence
in
the
record
the
cftc
must
show
its
work
it
did
not
instead
it
merely
noted
the
existence
of
research
suggesting
that
election
prediction
markets
might
be
harmful
and
then
leapt
to
the
conclusion
that
they
must
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
was
incumbent
on
the
cftc
to
grapple
with
the
conflicting
evidence
in
the
record
and
give
a
reasoned
explanation
of
why
it
reached
its
conclusion
