the
cftc
focused
on
the
meaning
given
by
the
second
circuit
to
the
word
commodity
and
argued
that
it
has
jurisdiction
over
commodities
that
commodities
means
virtually
every
good
or
service
tangible
or
intangible
domestic
or
foreign
and
that

cftc
interpretation

according
to
the
cftc
event
contracts
have
been
based
on
a
wide
variety
of
interests
including
the
results
of
presidential
elections
the
accomplishment
of
certain
scientific
advances
world
population
levels
the
adoption
of
particular
pieces
of
legislation
the
outcome
of
corporate
product
sales
the
declaration
of
war
and
the
length
of
celebrity
marriages
at
sixteen
years
later
the
cftc
has
not
yet
undertaken
an
events
contract
rulemaking
the
cftc
assertion
of
plenary
jurisdiction
is
especially
dangerous
in
the
context
of
event
contracts
for
which
the
cftc
has
yet
to
express
clear
rules
take
one
of
the
event
contracts
posited
by
the
cftc
the
length
of
a
celebrity
marriage
perhaps
it
would
be
reasonably
within
the
scope
of
investigating
market
manipulation
if
the
celebrity
attorney
or
accountant
had
a
position
in
the
contract
or
one
of
the
couple
was
photographed
in
public
being
intimate
with
a
non
spouse
but
based
on
the
cftc
stated
position
in
its
order
here
including
an
ability
to
question
why
someone
voted
as
he
or
she
did
ar
20
it
seems
that
the
cftc
would
claim
jurisdiction
to
step
in
even
when
there
are
other
government
entities
that
regulate
the
activity
such
as
to
determine
when
and
whether
there
was
a
divorce
or
whether
the
grounds
for
divorce
were
proper
or
consider
the
case
of
an
event
contract
on
the
population
of
a
city
cftc
claim
would
presumably
include
authority
to
investigate
for
market
manipulation
for
example
a
person
with
a
long
position
in
the
contract
who
advocated
against
abortion
the
cftc
has
elsewhere
seemed
to
assert
that
its
jurisdiction
to
investigate
manipulation
is
not
limited
to
transactions
in
commodities
but
also
includes
claimed
personal
uses
of
commodities
for
example
one
cftc
commissioner
claimed
that
the
cftc
has
authority
to
investigate
fraud
with
respect
to

purported
environmental

by
this
logic
the
cftc
would
have
the
authority
to
investigate
fraud
with
respect
to
the
purported
health
benefits
of
vaccines
and
why
stop
with
purported
benefits
if
the
cftc
has
the
power
to
investigate
fraud
with
respect
to
any
aspect
of
any
commodity
the
cftc
jurisdiction
is
virtually
unlimited
especially
when
commodities
means
everything
the
breadth
of
power
claimed
by
the
cftc
could
mean
that
if
an
election
changed
control
of
congress
in
a
way
the
cftc
dislikes
it
could
investigate
that
election
as
manipulation
of
the
event
contract
and
before
an
election
a
government
ability
to
regulate
and
investigate
opinion
polling
could
be
abused
to
stay
in
power
ar
1062
this
court
should
thus
consider
whether
the
cftc
actual
jurisdiction
and
investigative
authority
in
administering
these
contracts
matches
what
the
cftc
claims
ii
the
cftc
order
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
its
order
here
the
cftc
said
that
the
binary
payout
of
the
congressional
control
contracts
further
limits
their
utility
as
a
vehicle
for
hedging
any
eventual
economic
effects
resulting
from
which
party
controls
a
chamber
of
congress
ar
18
this
makes
no
sense
and
is
contradicted
by
the
record
which
provided
evidence
that
binary
payouts
enhance
hedging
utility
for
example
a
company
that
faces
a
risk
from
one
political
party
but
not
the
other
ar
1054
55
if
only
one
party
presents
a
risk
there
is
no
need
for
a
payout
if
the
other
party
is
not
in
power
thus
binary
payouts
are
appropriate
and
effective
at
mitigating
risk
