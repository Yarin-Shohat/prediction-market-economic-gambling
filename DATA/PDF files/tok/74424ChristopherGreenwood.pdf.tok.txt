i
support
kalshi
bid
to
host
election
markets
because
i
believe
in
democracy
to
claim
that
election
markets
are
gaming
would
be
to
claim
that
elections
do
not
have
predictable
consequences
for
the
world
clearly
the
actions
of
policymakers
do
have
consequences
something
directly
impacting
my
bottom
line
is
the
decision
made
by
the
government
around
the
forgiveness
of
student
loans
thus
the
relevant
question
is
whether
such
decisions
outcomes
are
predictable
based
on
which
party
wins
an
election
if
these
outcomes
are
not
predictable
despite
the
platforms
goals
of
the
two
parties
clearly
differing
from
one
another
then
the
democratic
system
is
a
failure
why
bother
voting
if
outcomes
are
not
predictable
what
would
be
left
of
the
claim
that
america
has
a
globally
envied
political
system
if
its
premier
financial
regulator
says
that
actually
the
american
people
are
chumps
for
expecting
their
votes
the
expression
of
their
collective
political
desires
to
actually
change
the
country
in
the
manner
they
desire
at
a
time
when
democracy
is
threatened
both
at
home
and
abroad
i
hope
the
cftc
does
do
further
damage
by
undermining
the
intellectual
justification
for
voting
