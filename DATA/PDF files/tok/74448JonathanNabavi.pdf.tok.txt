submits
this
letter
in
response
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
commission
request
for
public
comment
on
the
commission
proposed
amendments
to
ss
40
i
i
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
or
the
act
to
further
specify
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
of
the
act
and
may
not
be
listed
or
accepted
for
trading
or
clearing
cea
section
authorizes
the
commission
to
prohibit
certain
events
contracts
from
being
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
if
such
contracts
involve
an
activity
that
is
enumerated
in
cea
one
category
of
contracts
that
is
currently
prohibited
by
section
is
gaming
contracts
and
the
proposed
amendments
would
further
clarify
the
types
of
contracts
covered
by
that
prohibition
including
those
that
involve
sports
wagering
the
nfl
remains
concerned
in
light
of
several
outstanding
questions
that
if
sports
wagering
contracts
were
to
be
permitted
they
potentially
could
negatively
impact
the
integrity
of
and
consumer
confidence
in
our
games
the
nfl
is
concerned
that
if
sports
related
gaming
contracts
were
to
be
permitted
such
contracts
may
not
be
used
in
a
legitimate
effort
to
mitigate
commercial
risk
these
contracts
would
mimic
sports
betting
but
seemingly
without
the
robust
regulatory
features
that
accompany
regulated
and
legalized
sports
betting
and
which
help
to
mitigate
threats
to
the
integrity
of
our
contests
they
would
fall
outside
the
purview
of
sports
betting
regulatory
authorities
and
the
safeguards
they
impose
upon
the
industry
we
agree
with
the
commission
that
participants
in
sports
related
gaming
contracts
markets
would
primarily
be
speculators
rather
than
participants
with
legitimate
commercial
hedging
interests
and
we
share
the
concem
that
these
contracts
if
not
properly
regulated
could
be
susceptible
to
manipulation
or
price
distortion
it
is
also
possible
that
if
sports
related
gaming
contracts
markets
were
permitted
the
amounts
wagered
through
these
markets
by
individual
speculators
could
be
significantly
larger
than
those
typically
wagered
through
the
regulated
sports
betting
markets
potentially
creating
greater
risk
to
contest
integrity
any
future
consideration
of
these
contracts
should
thoroughly
address
these
issues
since
the
repeal
of
the
professional
and
amateur
sports
protection
act
paspa
thirty
eight
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
and
have
utilized
existing
authority
or
passed
legislation
to
allow
sports
betting
the
sports
betting
ecosystem
is
interconnected
between
professional
sports
organizing
bodies
the
operators
advertisers
legislators
and
regulators
lawmakers
in
many
states
have
enacted
robust
regulatory
regimes
which
include
measures
to
promote
information
sharing
between
sportsbook
operators
and
leagues
sports
integrity
monitoring
requirements
prohibitions
on
markets
that
may
be
more
easily
manipulated
requirements
to
use
consistent
and
reliable
official
league
data
know
your
customer
and
problem
gambling
requirements
and
resources
this
is
in
part
a
result
of
the
nfl
ongoing
efforts
to
ensure
legalized
sports
betting
is
properly
regulated
to
protect
the
interests
of
participants
and
fans
there
is
no
greater
priority
for
the
nfl
than
protecting
the
integrity
of
our
games
our
fans
deserve
to
know
that
we
are
doing
everything
possible
to
ensure
no
improper
influences
affect
how
our
games
are
played
our
players
coaches
and
other
league
and
club
personnel
deserve
to
know
that
we
are
taking
all
appropriate
steps
to
ensure
our
games
are
not
subjected
to
unfair
and
unwarranted
allegations
relating
to
sports
gambling
or
manipulation
the
nfl
employs
a
multi
faceted
approach
to
achieving
these
goals
which
is
grounded
in
policies
education
training
and
partnerships
with
a
variety
of
organizations
to
monitor
protect
and
enhance
the
integrity
of
our
sport
we
also
work
closely
to
advise
legislators
and
regulators
on
critical
consumer
protections
pertaining
to
sports
betting
additionally
the
nfl
has
worked
to
establish
the
coalition
of
responsible
sports
betting
advertising
to
establish
safeguards
around
how
sports
betting
is
presented
to
consumers
during
our
game
broadcasts
the
coalition
for
responsible
sports
betting
advertising
is
a
voluntary
association
of
sports
leagues
and
media
entities
including
the
nfl
mlb
mls
nascar
nba
wnba
nhl
pga
tour
nbcuniversal
and
fox
who
have
come
together
with
a
commitment
to
doing
our
part
to
help
ensure
a
responsible
approach
to
sports
betting
advertising
the
nfl
appreciates
the
commission
time
and
consideration
of
these
matters
as
it
evaluates
any
potential
action
regarding
events
based
futures
contracts
we
are
available
to
discuss
further
if
the
commission
has
any
questions
regarding
our
submission
