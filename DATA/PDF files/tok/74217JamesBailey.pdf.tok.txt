dear
cftc
commissioners
i
am
writing
to
express
my
support
for
prediction
markets
and
event
contracts
particularly
in
light
of
recent
developments
and
ongoing
research
i
would
like
to
expand
on
the
following
points
1
academic
support
for
prediction
markets
the
academic
literature
continues
to
provide
strong
support
for
the
value
and
utility
of
prediction
markets
a
2023
study
published
in
the
american
journal
of
economics
and
sociology
highlights
how
these
markets
serve
as
valuable
tools
for
aggregating
diverse
information
and
predicting
future
events
with
a
high
degree
of
accuracy
this
is
one
more
entry
in
a
long
line
of
supportive
work
such
as
the
2008
science
paper
the
promise
of
prediction
markets
which
includes
5
nobel
laureates
among
its
coauthors
2
enhancing
price
discovery
and
risk
reduction
event
contracts
facilitate
price
discovery
by
highlighting
potential
future
scenarios
and
their
probabilities
this
awareness
helps
stakeholders
better
understand
and
prepare
for
tail
risks
thereby
reducing
uncertainty
and
potential
negative
impacts
on
the
broader
economy
for
instance
political
event
contracts
have
been
instrumental
in
highlighting
significant
possibilities
such
as
the
potential
for
an
incumbent
president
to
withdraw
from
a
race
this
early
warning
system
allows
businesses
and
individuals
to
anticipate
and
strategize
for
various
political
outcomes
3
improve
political
information
the
core
benefit
of
price
discovery
in
prediction
markets
is
that
it
provides
onlookers
not
just
participants
with
more
accurate
information
about
the
world
where
it
has
been
allowed
this
includes
more
accurate
information
about
political
outcomes
this
information
can
allow
political
participants
such
as
parties
and
voters
to
see
which
candidates
are
more
likely
to
succeed
and
where
they
should
target
their
resources
arguably
markets
were
one
reason
that
a
major
party
was
just
able
to
realize
they
were
heading
for
defeat
and
correct
course
finding
a
new
candidate
that
markets
realized
would
be
more
appealing
to
voters
even
though
polls
at
the
time
did
not
indicate
this
and
the
replacement
poll
numbers
only
shot
up
once
they
were
no
longer
merely
a
hypothetical
option
4
we
already
have
election
cops
i
outline
above
some
benefits
of
election
event
contracts
that
the
commissioners
may
not
have
considered
but
chair
benham
has
argued
that
these
contracts
would
come
with
the
cost
of
turning
the
cftc
into
election
cops
while
the
cftc
might
choose
to
try
to
expand
its
power
by
bringing
cases
in
that
direction
this
would
in
no
way
be
necessary
since
the
united
states
already
has
election
cops
at
the
state
and
federal
levels
and
electoral
fraud
is
already
illegal
if
the
concern
is
that
markets
could
increase
the
incentives
for
electoral
fraud
the
commission
should
consider
whether
there
are
ways
to
limit
these
incentives
without
entirely
banning
political
event
contracts
and
losing
the
informational
benefits
thereof
for
instance
by
limiting
the
size
of
event
contracts
as
they
have
in
the
predictit
no
action
letter
