finally
the

does
not

to
enact
the

that
the

makes
a
category
error
by
misconstruing

48994
having
committed
this

error
the

ties
itself
into
knots
by
envisioning
that
all
contests

or
even

in

with

should
be
proscribed
because
some
states
regulate
gambling
on
these
things
see

but
the

does
not
delegate
the
cftc
with
power
to
ban
trading
for
activities
that
arguably
resemble
activities
that
some
jurisdictions
regulate
as

the
statute
instead
permits
the

to
prohibit

that
is
those
related
to

consider
the
prohibitions
on
terrorism
assassination
and

these
subject
matters
pertain
to

and
so
the
statute
allows
the
commission
to
prohibit
staking
money
on
such
events
but
the
proposed
definition
of

misreads
that
term
differently
from
the
other

categories
and
as
synonymous
with

the

clearly
worries

example
one
can
imagine
a

based
on
the

of

a
geiger
counter
detects
over
a

time
period
such
wager
would
not
be
on
a
game
as
commonly
understood
but
the
random
and
useless
nature
of
the

resembles
the
output
of

it
would
be
a
sort
of

we
agree
that
markets
like
these
would
serve
no
significant
commercial
journalistic
or
social
purpose
such
markets
fundamentally
resemble
gaming
wagers
on
game
outcomes

whether
a

rolls

arise

the
deliberate
creation
of

opportunities

the

to
the
extent
that
the
commission
believes
that
gambling
on
prediction
markets
would
be
contrary
to

the
proposal
is
both
and
over
inclusive
it
permits
gambling
on
trivial
outcomes
while
prohibiting
contracts
that
provide
immense
social
value
the
commission
must
exercise
its
residual
power
in
a
principled
way
that
permits
contracts
on
predictions
at
least
as
valuable
as
soybean
futures
and
only
prohibits
contracts
on
occurrences
that
resemble
gaming
event
outcomes
that
have
no
real
world
repercussions
beyond
the
participants
of
the
game
like

and
those
who
place
stakes

the

better
address
the

about
