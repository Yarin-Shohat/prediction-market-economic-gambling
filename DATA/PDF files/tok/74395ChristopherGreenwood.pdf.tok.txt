re

in
response
to
the

request
for
comment
on
kalshiex

proposed
event
contracts
dear
commissioners
we
greatly
appreciate
this
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
political
event
contracts
contracts
that
our
client
kalshiex
llc
a
designated
contract
market
submitted
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
for
approval
on
july

the
commission
determined
to
solicit
public
input
regarding
the
contracts
on
august
26
2022
by
posting
to
its
website
17
questions
about
them
questions
as
always
the
commission
should
be
applauded
for
its
measured
and
deliberate
approach
to
considering
matters
like
the
contracts
that
are
significant
to
the
development
and
growth
of
financial
markets
as
a
firm
we
have
worked
for
decades
to
assist
financial
institutions
operating
companies
and
investment
funds
with
all
manner
of
transactional
litigation
and
regulatory
matters
involving
the
derivatives
markets
this
experience
is
enhanced
by
our
colleagues
who
have
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
serving
on
the
commission
staff
and
our
more
recent
experience
representing
fintech
companies
we
greatly
respect
the
commission
as
an
institution
that
serves
the
public
interest
as
well
as
the
professional
staff
who
work
tirelessly
to
pursue
that
end
former
employees
of
all
three
branches
of
the
federal
government
are
well
represented
at
the
firm
so
we
can
appreciate
the
effort
it
requires
for
the
commission
to
focus
on
specific
issues
like
this
one
given
the
heavy
workload
that
it
carries
in
effecting
congressional
rulemaking
mandates
while
seeking
to
ensure
market
integrity
to
protect
customers
and
investors
and
to
enforce
the
law
in
cases
where
it
may
have
been
violated
with
our
esteem
for
the
agency
in
mind
and
in
full
candor
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
commission
is
taking
the
wrong
approach
to
evaluating
the
contracts
in
the
following
respects
it
is
wrong
to
review
the
contracts
under
regulation
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
as
the
questions
do
that
the
contracts
must
be
shown
to
have
an
economic
purpose
like
hedging
or
price
basing
before
they
can
be
approved
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
questions
that
the
contracts
are
themselves
some
type
of
gaming
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
questions
that
the
contracts
may
be
ill
suited
to
the
hedging
needs
of
individuals
and
that
other
derivatives
contracts
may
be
more
suitable
it
would
be
wrong
to
disapprove
the
contracts
based
on
a
finding
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
address
these
points
below
while
also
offering
our
view
of
what
the
right
approach
would
be
in
each
case
it
is
wrong
to
review
the
contracts
under
regulation
kalshi
submitted
the
contracts
for
review
and
approval
under
regulation
under
paragraph
b
of
that
regulation
the
commission
must
approve
a
new
product
unless
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
product
violate
either
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
commission
regulations
the
contracts
do
not
violate
the
law
or
the
rules
at
issue
which
means
that
they
should
have
been
reviewed
and
approved
within
either
the
45
days
allowed
the
commission
by
regulation
or
an
extended
period
as
agreed
by
the
commission
and
kalshi
under
regulation
according
to
the
commission
letter
to
kalshi
on
august
26
2022
however
the
contracts
are
instead
being
reviewed
under
regulation
on
the
basis
that
they
may
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
enumerated
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
the
activities
enumerated
in
those
provisions
are
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
and
crime
something
illegal
as
we
explain
below
the
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
none
of
these
things
instead
the
commission
should
consider
the
contracts
under
regulation
which
is
the
provision
under
which
kalshi
submitted
them
this
view
was
first
publicly
articulated
as
to
the
contracts
in
commissioner
pham
dissent
to
the
commission
decision
to
review
the
contracts
under
section
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
as
the
questions
do
that
the
contracts
must
be
shown
to
have
an
economic
purpose
like
hedging
or
price
basing
before
they
can
be
approved
that
test
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
at
any
point
in
its
history
the
commission
does
not
have
statutory
authority
to
impose
such
a
test
in
fact
we
have
found
that
at
most
congress
advanced
the
idea
of
an
economic
purpose
test
in
a
bill
that
never
made
it
into
the
commodity
exchange
act

the

test
is
derived
from
an

of
former

section
congress
instead
adopted
the
senate
broader
version
of
section
that
included

that

standard
was

striking

of

which
included

nor
is
there
anything
in
the
operative
sections
of
the
statute
and
the
rules
to
indicate
that
a
test
congress
never
adopted
should
have
any
relevance
to
the
commission
deliberations
today
section
we
submit
is
the
correct
statutory
standard
states
that
commission
shall
approve
a
new
contract
or
other
instrument
unless
it
finds
that
the
new
contract
or
other
instrument
would
violate
the
commodity
exchange
act
including
regulations
no
part
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
contains
an
express
economic
purpose
test
nor
does
a
designated
contract
market
like
kalshi
have
to
explain
the
economic
purpose
of
new
contracts
when
they
voluntarily
submit
them
for
commission
review
under
regulation
a
submission
requesting
approval
shall
as
regulation
explains
include
an
explanation
and
analysis
of
the
product
and
its
compliance
with
applicable
provisions
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
including
core
principles
and
the
commission
regulations
thereunder
this
explanation
and
analysis
shall
either
be
accompanied
by
the
documentation
relied
upon
to
establish
the
basis
for
compliance
with
the
applicable
law
or
incorporate
information
contained
in
such
documentation
with
appropriate
citations
to
data
sources
emphasis
added
no
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
the
commission
regulations
contemplated
by
this
instruction
states
that
a
designated
contract
market
must
provide
an
economic
purpose
for
new
contracts
that
it
has
submitted
for
commission
review
for
example
none
of
the
core
principles
for
designated
contract
markets
which
are
found
in
section
5
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
part
38
of
the
commission
regulations
impose
an
economic
purpose
requirement
on
contracts
that
the
market
lists
of
trading
the
commission
has
decided
to
evaluate
the
contracts
under
section
as
a
type
of
gaming
contract
and
therefore
it
is
proceeding
to
review
the
contracts
for
approval
under
regulation
even
under
those
two
provisions
no
requirement
for
establishing
a
contract
economic
purpose
can
be
found
section
provides
that
the
commission
may
determine
that
contracts
on
events
that
reference
terrorism
assassination
war
and
gaming
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
similarly
regulation
prohibits
a
registered
entity
like
a
designated
contract
market
from
for
trading
or
for
clearing
a
contract
that
references
an
activity
similar
to
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
crime
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
public
interest
is
not
the
same
thing
as
an
economic
purpose
and
the
commission
has
not
elsewhere
suggested
that
they
are
equivalent
indeed
the
questions
treat
the
concepts
of
economic
purpose
and
public
interest
separately
compare
questions
6
11
economic
purpose
to
questions
12
17
public
interest
instead
the
commission
should
determine
whether
the
contract
meets
the
requirements
stated
in
the
plain
statutory
and
rule
text
of
the
relevant
authorizing
provisions
as
explained
earlier
we
think
those
provisions
are
section
and
commission
regulation
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
questions
that
the
contracts
are
themselves
some
type
of
gaming
doing
so
conflates
an
enumerated
event
with
the
contracts
themselves
which
are
binary
options
that
is
the
contacts
could
only
fall
within
the
ambit
of
section
and
regulation
if
the
commission
premise
were
that
the
contracts
themselves
rather
than
the
events
that
they
reference
constitute
gaming
the
contracts
do
not
reference
an
event
of
terrorism
assassination
or
war
nor
do
they
involve
anything
that
is
illegal
under
federal
or
state
law
elections
are
plainly
lawful
for
the
commission
premise
to
be
valid
then
it
would
also
have
to
be
possible
for
there
to
be
contract
that
itself
would
be
an
event
of
terrorism
assassination
war
or
crime
that
would
be
a
total
non
sequitur
if
that
is
not
the
commission
premise
on
this
reading
then
the
commission
would
have
to
take
the
position
that
any
contract
referencing
a
type
of
event
enumerated
in
section
would
be
gaming
this
would
mean
that
a
contract
on
an
event
of
terrorism
assassination
war
or
crime
would
be
a
form
of
gaming
too
setting
aside
the
propriety
of
such
a
thing
if
the
statute
were
to
be
read
this
way
doing
so
would
make
the
enumerated
categories
other
than
gaming
superfluous
that
is
the
statute
could
accomplish
the
goal
of
prohibiting
gaming
simply
by
prohibiting
gaming
full
stop
taking
section
to
mean
that
all
referenced
contracts
are
gaming
contracts
would
be
wrong
however
it
is
canonical
that
each
word
in
a
statute
must
be
given
separate
effect
there
is
nothing
in
the
statutory
text
that
treats
gaming
differently
from
the
other
enumerated
event
types
a
contract
on
war
would
be
prohibited
just
the
same
as
a
contract
on
gaming
would
be
prohibited
for
example
a
contract
does
not
become
gaming
because
of
what
it
references
to
hold
so
would
be
contrary
to
what
the
statute
and
the
rule
both
say
the
commission
must
apply
the
commodity
exchange
act
as
it
is
written
by
congress
and
passed
into
law
in
this
regard
other
agency
publications
have
given
weight
to
certain
remarks
made
during
a
congressional
floor
debate
about
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
see

of

an
unpublished
decision
to
disapprove
sports
contracts
following
their
withdrawal

consideration

market

what
two
senators
said
in
a
floor
debate
does
not
control
where
as
here
the
full
senate
and
the
house
of
representatives
spoke
unambiguously
in
the
statute
still
what
those
senators
were
discussing
makes
clear
that
they
thought
section
would
prohibit
gambling
with
its
reference
to
gaming
including
futures
contracts
or
other
event
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
see
i
emphasis
added
instead
and
if
it
is
to
proceed
under
section
and
regulation
the
commission
should
review
whether
the
event
underlying
the
contracts
is
itself
gaming
that
is
easily
answered
elections
are
not
gaming
whether
the
gaming
definition
relied
upon
is
widely
accepted
or
more
abstruse
for
this
reason
we
do
not
attempt
to
suggest
to
the
commission
what
the
right
definition
of
gaming
should
be
doing
so
would
be
beside
the
point
it
is
wrong
to
suggest
in
the
questions
that
the
contracts
may
be
ill
suited
to
the
hedging
needs
of
individuals
and
that
other
derivatives
contracts
may
be
more
suitable
the
commodity
exchange
act
does
not
provide
that
a
new
contract
can
be
approved
only
if
it
is
suitable
for
use
by
customers
and
investors
nor
does
the
statute
give
the
commission
the
discretion
to
determine
whether
new
contracts
are
suitable
for
any
particular
purpose
before
they
are
approved
rather
section
states
that
in
reviewing
a
new
contract
the
commission
shall
approve
it
unless
the
commission
finds
that
it
would
violate
the
statute
or
commission
regulations
and
even
for
as
far
as
it
goes
section
does
not
impose
a
suitability
standard
or
give
the
commission
authority
to
disapprove
contracts
because
the
commission
thinks
that
other
existing
contracts
are
more
fit
for
the
intended
purpose
for
example
at
least
one
other
designated
contract
market
has
self
certified
contracts
on
large
events
that
may
have
diffuse
but
nonetheless
significant
impact
on
individuals

the
opportunity

with
hurricanes
or
tropical
storms
falling
within
a
specified
geographic
area
contracts
could
be
used
for
hedging
different
risks
available
at
instead
the
commission
should
apply
the
statutory
standard
of
section
as
it
was
written
by
congress
in
addition
the
questions
that
ask
about
the
potential
impacts
of
the
contracts
on
federal
campaign
finance
laws
are
irrelevant
under
the
standard
that
the
commission
is
directed
to
apply
by
section
that
subject
is
outside
the
scope
of
section
and
as
we
explain
in
the
next
section
the
public
interest
language
in
section
and
regulation
does
not
admit
for
any
consideration
of
campaign
finance
law
beyond
perhaps
an
event
that
violates
campaign
finance
law
illegal
conduct
a
campaign
finance
violation
is
different
than
an
election
outcome
it
would
be
wrong
to
disapprove
the
contracts
based
on
a
finding
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
public
interest
is
relevant
to
commission
reviews
under
section
and
regulation
in
three
ways
none
of
which
are
germane
to
the
contracts
first
clauses
of
section
state
that
the
commission
may
determine
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
involves
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
crime
plainly
an
election
is
not
any
of
those
things
second
clause
of
section
explains
that
the
commission
may
determine
that
a
new
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
involves
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
emphasis
added
an
election
is
not
similar
to
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
crime
third
o
paragraph
of
regulation
provides
that
a
contract
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
cleared
if
it
involves
relates
to
or
references
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
crime
and
that
the
commission
determines
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
emphasis
added
while
the
commission
may
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
its
ability
to
disapprove
them
becomes
operative
only
if
it
determines
that
elections
are
events
similar
to
those
enumerated
earlier
in
the
regulation
we
doubt
the
commission
would
be
able
to
make
such
a
determination
on
any
realistic
set
of
facts
o
instead
the
commission
would
have
to
consider
the
reference
to
public
interest
in
paragraph
of
regulation
as
a
freestanding
power
to
reject
any
contract
that
it
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
would
make
a
cannon
of
a
rifle
an
agency
must
not
read
into
a
rule
a
broader
power
than
exists
in
the
authorizing
statutory
language
the
public
interest
power
reserved
to
the
commission
in
section
only
extends
to
activity
similar
to
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
crime
going
beyond
that
with
the
rule
would
be
going
beyond
what
the
law
allows
this
may
well
be
why
the
questions
conflate
the
contracts
with
gaming
itself
because
to
read
the
statute
as
written
would
mean
the
contracts
are
permissible
under
section
and
regulation
instead
the
commission
should
approve
the
contracts
under
section
and
regulation
which
impose
no
public
interest
requirement
the
same
result
would
be
reached
even
if
the
commission
were
to
proceed
under
section
and
regulation
and
in
doing
so
applied
public
interest
as
it
is
used
in
those
provisions
we
greatly
appreciate
the
care
and
attention
that
the
commission
has
given
to
the
contracts
they
are
indeed
of
great
significance
to
the
development
and
growth
of
financial
markets
so
we
thank
the
commissioners
and
the
professional
staff
of
the
commission
for
the
time
that
they
are
continuing
to
dedicate
to
them
while
we
applaud
those
efforts
we
disagree
with
the
approach
being
taken
we
think
the
commission
is
fundamentally
mistaken
to
evaluate
the
contracts
as
if
they
involve
reference
or
relate
to
gaming
they
simply
do
not
we
thank
the
commission
once
more
for
undertaking
a
deliberate
public
process
with
regard
to
the
contracts
we
are
