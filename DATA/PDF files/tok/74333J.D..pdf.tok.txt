event
contracts
are
financial
instruments
that
entitle
a
purchaser
to
payment
based
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
a
real
world
event
like
other
derivatives
they
are
used
as
a
tool
to
mitigate
risk
for
example
consider
a
yes
no
contract
on
whether
a
major
hurricane
will
make
landfall
on
the
gulf
coast
a
hotel
chain
might
acquire
yes
contracts
as
a
hedge
against
closed
beaches
conversely
a
construction
firm
focused
on
storm
repair
work
might
buy
no
positions
as
a
hedge
against
lost
revenue
if
a
major
hurricane
does
hit
the
hotel
chain
will
receive
a
payout
if
not
the
construction
company
will
each
has
hedged
its
risks
3
this
case
involves
event
contracts
based
on
political
events
meaning
those
relating
to
the
composition
or
activities
of
government
political
events
carry
enormous
financial
implications
for
businesses
and
individuals
will
congress
pass
funding
legislation
before
an
impending
shutdown
will
the
epa
promulgate
a
new
limit
on
tailpipe
emissions
will
the
federal
reserve
cut
interest
rates
by
the
end
of
the
year
those
are
real
examples
of
event
contracts
offered
in
the
market
by
kalshi
and
others
for
good
reason
uncertainty
surrounding
these
events
poses
economic
risk
no
less
than
uncertainty
over
hurricanes
pandemics
or
oil
supply
4
beyond
their
economic
hedging
benefits
political
event
contracts
serve
the
interests
of
the
public
by
harnessing
the
unparalleled
power
of
free
markets
to
produce
high
quality
dynamic
predictive
data
they
offer
the

a
unique
window
into

perceptions
of

commentators
and

thus
often
cite
alongside

kalshi
operates
a
regulated

that
allows
members
of
the
public
to
trade
event

its
mission
is
to
create
opportunities
for
individuals
and

to

in
ways
previously
available
only
to
large

in
june
2023
kalshi
sought
to
list
contracts
contingent
on
whether
a
particular
party
will
control
the
house
of
representatives
or
senate
as
of
a
particular
date
congressional
control
contracts
those
contracts
do
not
involve
unlawful
acts
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
the
cftc
thus
has
no
power
to
prohibit
them
nor
are
they
in
any
way
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congressional
control
contracts
would
enable
hedging
against
economic
risks
associated
with
one
party
control
of
congress
and
their
fluctuating
prices
would
provide
useful
predictive
data
to
the
public
hundreds
of
public
comments
from
noted
academics
real
business
owners
and
former
cftc
officials
among
others
explained
all
of
this
8
the
cftc
blocked
kalshi
contracts
anyway
it
reasoned
that
the
statute
empowers
it
to
ban
event
contracts
whenever
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
would
amount
to
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
not
merely
when
the
event
underlying
the
contract
involves
such
an
activity
trading
on
a
contract
that
depends
on
the
result
of
an
election
the
commission
continued
amounts
to
gaming
and
may
also
violate
some
state
gambling
laws
because
it
stakes
money
on
a
contingent
event
having
found
the
congressional
control
contracts
subject
to
public
interest
scrutiny
the
cftc
concluded
that
the
contracts
fail
it
because
they
supposedly
would
further
no
economic
purpose
while
threatening
election
integrity
9
the
order
analysis
fails
at
every
step
it
contorts
and
misapplies
the
cea
text
ignores
its
structure
and
purpose
allows
a
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
and
engages
in
faulty
and
unsupported
reasoning
10
to
start
the
commission
amounts
to
test
bungles
the
statute
text
trading
an
event
contract
can
never
amount
to
terrorism
assassination
or
warfare
accordingly
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
the
provision
as
a
whole
is
to
read
the
cea
reference
to
contracts
that
involve
those
activities
as
focused
on
the
contract
underlying
event
for
example
the
commission
may
prohibit
a
contract
contingent
on
whether
the
president
will
be
assassinated
because
the
contract
underlying
event
involves
an
assassination
and
the
cftc
may
reasonably
determine
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
a
contract
to
pay
out
if
the
president
is
assassinated
on
that
common
sense
reading
the
congressional
control
contracts
are
not
subject
to
public
interest
review
because
partisan
control
of
a
congressional
chamber
involves
neither
gaming
nor
unlawful
activity
11
on
its
flawed
reading
of
involve
however
the
commission
found
that
buying
a
congressional
control
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
gambling
prohibited
by
state
law
because
purchasers
would
stake
money
on
a
contingent
event
which
some
states
define
as
gambling
but
buying
one
of
these
contracts
is
nothing
like
betting
on
a
game
of
chance
or
even
the
super
bowl
elections
are
not
a
game
they
have
real
economic
consequences
nor
did
congress
implicitly
empower
50
state
legislatures
to
ban
event
contracts
through
the
backdoor
just
the
opposite
congress
gave
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
preempted
contrary
state
law
12
the
commission
interpretations
of
involve
gaming
and
unlawful
cause
the
cea
narrow
exceptions
to
swallow
its
general
rule
if
the
cftc
may
ban
any
event
contract
so
long
as
buying
or
selling
that
contract
would
amount
to
illegal
gaming
and
if
illegal
gaming
includes
staking
money
on
any
contingency
the
cftc
could
prohibit
any
event
contract
based
solely
on
its
view
of
the
public
interest
had
congress
intended
to
confer
such
sweeping
authority
on
the
cftc
it
would
have
said
so
instead
it
authorized
the
commission
to
undertake
public
interest
review
of
event
contracts
only
if
they
fall
into
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
13
the
cftc
public
interest
analysis
which
it
had
no
authority
to
conduct
in
the
first
place
is
just
as
flawed
as
its
statutory
construction
applying
an
invented
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
dismissed
comments
from
economists
investment
bankers
and
real
business
owners
all
of
whom
identified
demonstrable
hedging
benefits
associated
with
the
congressional
control
contracts
the
commission
instead
improvised
heightened
requirements
that
fundamentally
misunderstand
how
risk
hedging
works
and
then
ignored
the
evidence
that
kalshi
proposed
contracts
meet
even
those
requirements
it
likewise
ignored
the
established
price
basing
function
of
these
contracts
and
it
followed
up
with
unfounded
and
implausible
speculation
about
election
integrity
as
if
businesses
and
individuals
did
not
already
have
significant
economic
exposure
to
electoral
outcomes
much
of
the
cftc
public
interest
reasoning
would
equally
condemn
most
event
contracts
once
again
that
approach
is
fundamentally
irreconcilable
with
the
statute
congress
enacted
14
at
bottom
it
is
undeniable
that
election
outcomes
have
consequences
for
everyone
they
play
a
pivotal
role
in
determining
our
collective
future
allowing
people
to
trade
safely
on
election
outcomes
will
give
them
the
freedom
to
protect
their
financial
interests
a
legitimate
market
will
also
yield
more
credible
and
transparent
election
forecasting
especially
relative
to
the
bias
of
polling
election
markets
offer
transparency
clarity
and

equipping
americans
to
filter

they

kalshi

built
the
protective

it

unlawful

corrupts

dramatically
expands

in

kalshi

the
cftc
exceeded
its
lawful

and
engaged

arbitrary
and
capricious

this

therefore
set

21
many
derivatives
contracts
are
tools
to
mitigate
risk
including
risk
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
events
event
contracts
are
the
purest
expression
of
that
concept
they
are
financial
instruments
that
specify
a
future
event
with
different
potential
outcomes
a
payment
structure
for
those
outcomes
and
a
date
when
the
contract
expires
these
contracts
typically
center
on
a
yes
or
no
question
whether
the
federal
reserve
will
cut
its
target
federal
funds

range
before
a

an

if

not
until
that
while
it
remains
uncertain
whether
the
underlying
event
will
transpire
the
contract
price
will
fluctuate
event
contracts
trade
on
a
centralized
exchange
similar
to
a
stock
market
their
prices
are
determined
by
market
forces
not
by
the
exchange
traders
can
buy
and
sell
a
contract
at
any
time
before
its
expiration
23
as
in
other
markets
traders
arrive
at
prices
for
event
contracts
based
on
all
available
information
at
the
time
if
new
information
arises
related
to
the
likelihood
of
an
event
the
price
of
a
contract
contingent
on
that
event
will
change
as
a
result
the
market
prices
of
event
contracts
reflect
real
time
probabilistic
beliefs
about
whether
the
underlying
event
will
occur
for
example
if
a
yes
contract
on
a
government
shutdown
occurrence
is
trading
for
and
thus
the
corresponding
no
position
is
trading
for
that
means
the
market
currently
believes
there
is
a
60
chance
the
shutdown
will
occur
and
a
40
chance
that
it
will
not
24
event
contracts
give
traders
direct
exposure
to
the
outcome
of
real
world
events
with
economic
ramifications
no
other
instrument
perfectly
captures
the
risks
inherent
in
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
an
event
for
example
a
trader
can
use
a
futures
contract
on
the
500
stock
index
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
economy
will
grow
generally
but
that
contract
would
be
a
very
imprecise
way
of
addressing
whether
the
next
gdp
report
will
identify
economic
growth
above
a
certain
level
only
an
event
contract
on
the
next
gdp
announcement
would
do
that
25
like
other
forms
of
derivatives
event
contracts
thus
allow
businesses
and
individuals
to
hedge
against
risks
for
example
a
beachfront
property
owner
in
a
city
might
buy
contracts
predicting
that
a
hurricane
will
hit
that
city
because
the
payout
could
offset
economic
losses
the
owner
is
more
likely
to
incur
if
a
hurricane
hits
or
a
firm
in
a
regulated
industry
might
buy
contracts
predicting
that
a
very
aggressive
nominee
will
be
confirmed
as
its
lead
regulator
to
help
mitigate
the
risks
associated
with
that
official
adverse
regulatory
agenda
26
event
contracts
are
distinct
from
insurance
the
property
owner
in
the
example
above
could
buy
insurance
to
cover
actual
property
losses
including
from
a
hurricane
an
event
contract
would
instead
hedge
the
diffuse
risk
of
losses
associated
with
a
hurricane
including
property
damage
a
decline
in
airbnb
revenues
and
higher
costs
of
food
and
water
meanwhile
the
regulated
firm
might
be
able
to
buy
insurance
for
the
cost
of
legal
defense
but
an
event
contract
would
directly
hedge
the
manifold
risks
associated
with
a
hostile
regulator
27
beyond
economic
benefits
to
traders
event
contracts
also
generate
informational
value
for
the
public
as
their
prices
can
be
understood
as
a
collective
prediction
by
the
market
the
expectations
and
willingness
of
traders
to
put
their
money
on
the
line
form
the
price
which
reflects
the
market
view
of
the
odds
that
an
event
will
occur
prediction
markets
therefore
serve
as
high
powered
and
highly
effective
information
aggregation
tools
generating
crucial
insights
for
researchers
businesses
individuals
and
governments
and
the
resulting
data
about
the
market
perception
of
the
event
likelihood
can
be
used
in
turn
to
determine
prices
for
assets
whose
value
depends
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
the
underlying
event
political
event
contracts
allow
for
hedging
of
political
risk
and
aggregation
of
useful
predictive
data
28
politics
no
less
than
agriculture
weather
or
inflation
is
beset
with
uncertainty
and
given
the
many
ways
in
which
governments
influence
the
economy
political
events
can
have
just
as
profound
an
effect
on
a
firm
bottom
line
as
spikes
in
energy
prices
or
interest
rates
businesses
and
individuals
thus
have
good
reason
to
use
derivatives
to
hedge
political
risks
just
as
they
hedge
other
risks
and
no
financial
instrument
is
better
suited
to
hedge
risks
associated
with
political
events
than
contracts
that
reference
the
events
themselves
29
indeed
kalshi
has
offered
event
contracts
based
on
whether
certain
legislation
would
be
enacted
whether
certain
presidential
nominees
would
be
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
whether
the
federal
government
would
shut
down
all
of
which
are
political
events
that
carry
obvious
economic
repercussions
for
a
wide
range
of
businesses
and
individuals
30
like
other
political
events
election
outcomes
have
vast
consequences
for
businesses
and
individuals
to
quote
harvard
university
professor
jason
furman
the
former
chairman
of
the
council
of
economic
advisors
under

obama
congressional
control
impacts
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
ways
that
have
direct
economic
consequence
to
businesses
and
workers
this
risk
is
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
similar
risks
that
can
and
should
be
managed
using
the
financial
markets
31
large
financial
institutions
already
design
bespoke
derivatives
for
large
corporate
customers
to
hedge
against
these
risks
they
used
complex
structured
products
to
prepare
for
risks
associated
with
brexit
the
2016
election
and
other
world
changing
political
events
event
contracts
on
regulated
exchanges
like
kalshi
offer
the
same
opportunities
to
smaller
enterprises
and
individuals
32
political
event
contracts
also
have
other
benefits
researchers
public
organizations
businesses
and
governments
continuously
seek
information
about
the
likelihood
of
future
political
events
among
other
things
that
information
helps
to
determine
prices
for
assets
that
are
exposed
to
political
risk
but
traditional
opinion
polls
and
other
methods
of
measuring
public
attitudes
often
can
not
replicate
the
robustness
flexibility
or
neutrality
of
market
based
indicia
that
is
why
media
outlets
routinely
rely
on
political
event
marketplaces
when
reporting
on
political
developments
33
indeed
political
event
markets
are
already
widespread
the
best
known
example
predictit
is
a
futures
market
for
politics
that
allows

on

outcomes

the

shall

in

congress
amended
the
cea
to
prohibit
the
listing
of
certain
event
contracts
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
but
the
commission
authority
in
this
regard
is
limited
it
may
determine
that
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
only
if
the
contract
one
of
six
enumerated
activities
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
can
not
undertake
any
public
interest
review
unless
the
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
43
the
process
for
reviewing
event
contracts
therefore
proceeds
in
two
basic
steps
first
the
commission
determines
whether
the
contract
involves
one
of
the
six
enumerated
if
not
the
contract
may
be
listedperiod
second
if
the
contract
does
involve
a
listed
activity
the
cftc
may
determine
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
bar
its
listing
44
for
example
a
contract
that
entitles
the
buyer
to
payment
if
a
terrorist
group
carries
out
an
attack
on
soil
would
involve
terrorism
a
contract
contingent
on
whether
the
president
will
be
assassinated
would
involve
assassination
and
one
contingent
on
the
progress
of
russian
forces
against
a
ukrainian
target
would
involve
war
the
cftc
would
be
empowered
to
review
those
contracts
to
determine
whether
they
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
to
block
them
if
it
concludes
that
they
are
although
those
examples
may
sound
far
fetched
foreign
websites
are
currently
offering
contracts
on
among
other
things
will
a
nuclear
bomb
explode
in
ukraine
in
2023
congress
thus
had
good
reason
to
provide
the
cftc
with
a
means
to
block
these
dangerous
contracts
45
the
cftc
has
promulgated
an
implementing
regulation
it
provides
that
a
market
shall
not
list
for
trading
any
event
contract
that
involves
relates
to
or
references
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
or
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
an
enumerated
activity
that
the
commission
determines
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
17
46
the
commission
has
not
exercised
its
authority
to
determine
by
rule
or
regulation
that
a
contract
involving
any
activity
similar
to
the
five
enumerated
ones
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
as
a
result
the
commission
may
subject
a
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
only
if
it
involves
illegal
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
47
the
cea
does
not
authorize
special
scrutiny
of
political
event
contracts
or
those
relating
to
elections
congress
could
have
added
elections
or
politics
to
its
list
of
enumerated
activities
but
did
not

of

kalshi
is

sell

kalshi
utilizes
its
innovative
proprietary
technology

the
commission
unanimously
authorized
kalshi
to
operate
its
regulated
exchange
in

49
contracts
traded
on
kalshi
market
involve
events
that
run
the
gamut
from
economics
to
culture
climate
public
health
and
transportation
for
example
traders
on

platform
may
buy

hurricanes
that
will
form
over
the
atlantic
next
year
or
whether
china
gdp
growth
will
exceed

also
lists
contracts
on
political
outcomes
such
as
whether

whether

will

these
are

based
on

question
will
chamber
of

those
who

to

imagine
a
green
energy
start
up
worried
that
republicans
will
cut
subsidy
programs
if
they
gain
control
of
the
senate
in
2025
it
might
hedge
its
risk
by
buying
contracts
to
that
effect
of
course
a
republican
senate
does
not
make
it
certain
the
subsidies
will
be
phased
out
but
it
does
increase
the
risk
of
that
loss
and
the
event
contracts
would
hedge
against
that
risk
if
the
senate
elects
a
republican
president
pro

the
start
up
would
receive
its
profit
would
be
the
difference
between
that

the

many

attested
that
they

overall
the
comments
explained
that
congressional

contracts
and
similar
instruments
are
not
merely
legal
therefore
must
be

for

but
also
carry
significant
societal

the
cftc
issues
a
flawed
order
rejecting

57
the
cftc
disagreed
on
september
22

the
cftc
issued
an
order
prohibiting

three

the
order
and
separate
statements
are
attached
as
exhibit
58
the
order
begins
by
reciting
that
the
commission
may
determine
that
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
contracts
involve
any
of
the
six
enumerated
activities
order
at
3
59
the
commission
found
that
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
involve
two
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
unlawful
activity
see
7
v
but
of
course
the
commission
did
not
and
could
not
find
that
elections
or
the
selection
of
a
speaker
or
president
pro
tempore
themselves
involve
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
rather
the
commission
reasoned
that
an
event
contract
those
activities
if
trading
in
the
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
illegal
activity
see
order
at
5
7
60
the
commission
then
declared
that
buying
or
selling
kalshi
contracts
would
amount
to
gaming
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
to
reach
that
conclusion
the
commission
relied
on
dictionary
definitions
and
state
statutes
that
broadly
define
illegal
gambling
to
include
staking
money
on
the
outcome
of
any
game
contest
or
contingent
event
at
8
61
finally
having
found
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
were
subject
to
public
interest
review
the
commission
determined
that
those
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
13
23
62
every
step
of
the
order
analysis
is
fatally
flawed
63
first
the
heart
of
the
commission
reasoning
is
its
implausibly
broad
and
shifting
interpretation
of
involve
the
commission
concluded
that
a
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
if
trading
in
the
contract
amounts
to
the
enumerated
activity
at
7
emphases
added
in
other
words
an
event
contract
need
not
be
contingent
on
the
occurrence
of
an
event
that
involves
crime
a
terrorist
attack
an
assassination
an
act
of
war
or
gaming
instead
a
contract
is
subject
to
public
interest
review
and
potential
rejection
if
engaging
in
the
transaction
would
amount
to
one
of
those
activities
64
that
interpretation
of
involves
fundamentally
misunderstands
the
statutory
structure
the
activities
enumerated
in
describe
events
that
underlie
a
contract
if
the
event
underlying
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
cftc
may
block
it
the
enumerated
activities
do
not
describe
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
itself
65
that
is
most
apparent
from
the
fact
that
trading
on
an
event
contract
could
never
constitute
an
act
of
terrorism
war
or
assassination
for
those
activities
the
focus
must
be
on
the
contract
underlying
event
to
justify
rejection
of
kalshi
contracts
the
commission
therefore
had
to
embrace
a
radically
different
meaning
of
the
word
involve
with
respect
to
two
and
only
two
of
the
statute
six
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
unlawful
acts
for
those
activities
alone
the
theory
goes
congress
referred
to
the
act
of
contracting
rather
than
to
the
contract
underlying
event
that
tortured
approach
under
which
the
same
operative
text
toggles
back
and
forth
between
two
inconsistent
meanings
over
five
subparagraphs
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
order
misconstrues
the
cea
66
second
turning
to
the
enumerated
activities
the
commission
again
adopted
definitions
that
statutory
context
forecloses
the
commission
reasoned
that
gaming
means
gambling
and
that
gambling
encompasses
any
wager
on
a
game
contest
or
contingent
event
at
8
because
those
who
trade
on
kalshi
contracts
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
the
commission
continued
that
act
of
trading
amounts
to
gambling
and
thus
gaming
at
10
67
but
especially
in
this
context
gaming
does
not
and
can
not
sweep
that
broadly
rather
it
refers
to
betting
on
games
and
especially
to
betting
on
games
of
chance
an
election
is
not
a
game
at
all
let
alone
the
equivalent
of
bingo
or
roulette
it
is
the
foundational
exercise
of
democratic
governance
unlike
games
elections
have
independent
and
meaningful
political
and
economic
consequences
68
as
a
group
of
distinguished
economics
scholars
including
a
nobel
laureate
told
the
cftc
in
a
comment
letter
an
election
prediction
market
is
no
more
gaming
than
traditional
financial
markets
including
commodity
futures
and
derivatives
markets
due
to
the
vast
economic
utility
of
the
contracts
69
the
commission
contrary
interpretation
fundamentally
upends
the
cea
entire
approach
after
all
every
event
contract
by
definition
stakes
money
on
a
contingent
event
as
a
result
under
the
commission
reading
of
involve
and
gaming
no
event
contract
would
escape
public
interest
scrutiny
that
would
render
the
remaining
enumerated
activities
entirely
superfluous
and
it
would
cause
this
one
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
flipping
the
statute
default
by
authorizing
cftc
public
interest
review
of
every
event
contract
70
similarly
the
commission
reasoned
that
trading
in
kalshi
contracts
would
be
unlawful
under
state
law
because
gambling
on
elections
is
illegal
in
some
states
at
11
12
the
commission
unlawful
activity
analysis
all
two
sentences
of
it
fares
no
better
than
its
approach
to
gaming
71
once
again
the
commission
jeopardizes
the
entire
statutory
structure
this
time
by
giving
states
veto
power
over
the
federal
regime
the
cea
preempts
state
law
in
this
area
in
favor
of
exclusive
cftc
jurisdiction
7
but
the
order
reasoning
empowers
states
to
trump
federal
law
and
effectively
ban
trading
in
event
contracts
merely
by
broadly
defining
gambling
indeed
some
state
laws
already
forbid
staking
money
on
any
contingent
event
see
order
at
8
so
in
this
respect
too
the
agency
interpretation
taken
seriously
would
shut
down
the
entire
national
market
in
event
contracts
that
is
patently
not
what
congress
intended
by
conferring
on
the
cftc
targeted
authority
to
prohibit
contracts
involving
war
assassination
and
the
other
tailored
categories
72
in
her
dissent
commissioner
mersinger
pointed
out
yet
another
flaw
in
the
commission
analysis
it
presumes
that
kalshi
contracts
are
premised
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
at
10
but
kalshi
contracts
do
not
turn
solely
on
the
results
of
any
one
election
they
turn
on
the
aggregate
results
of
all
relevant
elections
in
that
year
cycle
plus
the
chamber
previous
composition
plus
internal
party
machinations
as
recent
events
illustrate
internal
factions
can
prevent
even
a
majority
party
from
electing
a
speaker
at
most
congressional
control
is
highly
correlated
with
the
outcomes
of
many
elections
but
that
is
equally
true
of
many
event
contracts
that
the
cftc
has
never
derided
as
gaming
73
finally
having
decided
that
kalshi
contracts
involve
both
gaming
and
illegal
activity
the
commission
deemed
them
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
too
the
order
analysis
fails
the
standards
for
reasoned
decision
making
74
the
commission
began
with
an
economic
purpose
inquiry
found
in
no
statute
regulation
or
judicial
decision
at
13
it
claimed
the
economic
effects
of
congressional
control
are
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
warrant
hedging
or
price
basing
at
16
that
logic
is
demonstrably
flawed
on
at
least
three
levels
75
for
one
certain
effects
of
congressional
control
are
not
diffuse
think
of
a
consulting
firm
with
deep
ties
to
one
party
congressional
control
by
the
other
party
would
directly
harm
its
business
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
allow
it
to
hedge
against
that
risk
and
it
would
allow
others
to
more
accurately
determine
the
economic
value
of
that
firm
the
public
comments
are
full
of
real
examples
of
assets
and
markets
where
a
direct
link
to
electoral
outcomes
has
been
demonstrated
76
for
another
it
is
simply
wrong
to
say
that
diffuse
risks
do
not
justify
hedging
or
permit
price
basing
the
purpose
of
hedging
is
to
mitigate
risks
not
like
insurance
to
offset
precise
losses
that
is
why
award
winning
economists
submitted
comments
explaining
the
hedging
value
of
election
contracts
it
is
why
a
managing
director
at
a
leading
investment
bank
commented
that
he
regularly
assists
clients
with
hedging
election
risk
and
it
is
why
a
host
of
commenters
from
a
wide
range
of
industries
from
cannabis
to
green
energy
affirmatively
stated
they
would
use
kalshi
contracts
to
hedge
risk
for
all
of
the
same
reasons
the
market
ability
to
aggregate
information
about
the
likelihood
of
election
results
would
allow
that
data
to
play
a
role
in
determining
prices
for
assets
that
face
particular
political
risks
oil
companies
or
cryptocurrency
firms
the
commission
rejected
all
this
evidence
without
explanation
resting
on
its
own
say
so
in
the
face
of
concrete
contrary
proof
77
for
a
third
financial
products
including
event
contracts
are
often
used
to
hedge
diffuse
risks
consider
futures
based
on
a
price
volatility
index
vix
which
measures
expected
market
volatility
using
500
options
contracts
it
is
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
diffuse
but
volatility
is
associated
with
economic
risks
which
is
why
derivatives
are
offered
and
traded
based
on
it
including
on
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
a
large
and
well
established
derivatives
exchange
78
in
short
even
if
economic
purpose
were
a
legally
appropriate
inquiry
it
was
irrational
for
the
commission
to
subject
election
event
contracts
to
a
uniquely
higher
showing
of
economic
purpose
than
other
event
contracts
79
the
cftc
next
accused
kalshi
of
undermining
american
democracy
parroting
six
senators
who
submitted
comments
the
commission
intoned
that
the
contracts
threaten
to
profoundly
undermine
the
sanctity
and
democratic
value
of
elections
at
19
why
because
someone
might
vote
for
a
candidate
he
despises
in
a
quixotic
bid
to
swing
settlement
of
a
contract
on
control
of
congress
at
20
that
is
unsubstantiated
the
cftc
can
point
to
no
example
of
such
behavior
despite
the
prevalence
of
prediction
markets
both
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
it
is
also
implausible
why
would
anyone
buy
a
contract
favoring
a
party
they
oppose
and
then
bootstrap
that
purchase
to
change
their
voting
intentions
80
worse
yet
the
commission
warned
malicious
actors
might
spread
misinformation
to
manipulate
the
market
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
true
in
an
environment
with
unregulated
informational
a
free
society
lies
are
unavoidable
but
that
is
already
true
there
are
already
enormous
incentives
to
engage
in
political
dirty
tricks
the
commission
ploy
to
link
kalshi
contracts
to
the
bogeyman
of
misinformation
is
feeble
consisting
of
a
single
blog
post
expressing
about
fake
polling
companies
see
i
at
22
81
the
commission
supposed
fears
about
election
integrity
also
ignore
the
reality
that
businesses
and
individuals
already
face
economic
risks
associated
with
elections
political
spending
on
the
2020
federal
elections
reportedly
exceeded
14
billion
elections
matter
individuals
and
businesses
already
act
accordingly
allowing
event
contracts
based
on
electoral
outcomes
would
not
increase
the
risks
of
manipulation
if
anything
it
would
decrease
them
by
allowing
the
risks
associated
with
elections
to
be
hedged
and
the
existence
of
a
neutral
market
driven
measure
of
public
opinion
would
likewise
reduce
the
threat
of
fake
polls
and
disinformation
contract
markets
create
a
financial
incentive
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
political
discourse
and
limit
the
salience
of
any
particular
piece
of
fake
news
82
venturing
even
deeper
into
the
realm
of
speculation
the
commission
offered
a
final
reason
to
ban
kalshi
contracts
the
prospect
of
playing
election
cop
at
23
the
commission
fretted
that
approving
these
contracts
might
one
day
force
it
to
election
related
activities
potentially
including
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
at
22
once
again
the
commission
rationale
proves
too
much
the
cftc
already
regulates
countless
derivatives
markets
involving
commodities
over
which
the
agency
lacks
independent
expertise
or
authority
for
example
the
cftc
oversees
trading
in
futures
contracts
on
the
500
yet
the
commission
does
not
regulate
stocks
that
is
the
job
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
the
cftc
relies
on
to
prevent
manipulation
of
the
underlying
market
likewise
it
is
the
role
of
the
federal
election
commission
and
numerous
state
and
federal
regulators
to
supervise
the
integrity
of
elections
they
already
take
that
responsibility
incredibly
seriously
as
they
should
event
contracts
based
on
political
outcomes
would
not
somehow
change
that
or
thrust
this
role
onto
the
cftc
claims
violation
of
apa
83
kalshi
realleges
all
prior
paragraphs
84
the
apa
provides
that
the
court
shall
hold
unlawful
and
set
aside
agency
action
that
is
arbitrary
capricious
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not

law
or
that
is
in
excess
of
statutory

authority
or

or
short
of

5
c
85
the
cftc
is
an
agency
under
the
apa
i
and
the
order
is
a
final
reviewable
agency
action
for
which
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court
i
704
the
order
represents
the
consummation
of
the
cftc
decisionmaking
process
with
respect
to
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
86
kalshi
has
been
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
by
the
cftc
order
and
therefore
can
sue
under
the
apa
i
d
702
87
the
order
exceeds
the
commission
statutory
authority
is
contrary
to
law
and
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
88
the
order
fundamentally
misconstrues
every
relevant
statutory
term
to
start
it
misconstrues
to
authorize
public
interest
review
anytime
trading
in
the
contract
would
amount
to
an
enumerated
activity
but
the
only
reading
of
the
provision
that
makes
sense
as
applied
to
all
the
listed
activities
is
that
an
event
contract
involves
illegal
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
only
if
its
settlement
is
contingent
on
the
occurrence
of
such
an
event
the
events
underlying
the
congressional
control
contracts
do
not
involve
any
of
those
activities
89
the
order
compounds
its
error
by
distorting
the
two
enumerated
categories
that
it
invokes
first
it
converts
the
gaming
category
from
a
narrow
but
important
limit
on
using
derivatives
markets
to
bet
on
games
into
an
all
purpose
tool
for
banning
any
event
contract
second
the
order
construes
the
unlawful
activity
category
in
a
way
that
empowers
state
legislatures
to
dictate
the
legality
of
event
contracts
even
though
the
cea
preempts
state
laws
insofar
as
they
interfere
with
the
commission
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
derivatives
markets
90
the
commission
misreadings
of
the
cea
arrogate
authority
found
nowhere
in
the
statute
enabling
the
agency
to
review
and
reject
a
potentially
vast
array
of
event
contracts
indeed
potentially
all
of
them
any
interpretation
that
gives
the
commission
carte
blanche
to
reject
any
event
contracts
it
wishes
can
not
seriously
be
defended
as
consistent
with
the
cea
text
purpose
or
structure
91
the
order
again
employs
faulty
and
overreaching
reasoning
to
deem
kalshi
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
too
the
order
concocts
a
test
that
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
proceeds
to
misapply
it
ignoring
the
record
evidence
of
private
and
public
benefits
associated
with
political
event
contracts
the
order
traffics
in
rank
speculation
about
their
supposed
harms
it
offers
rationales
that
are
untethered
to
the
statutory
purpose
and
would
prove
far
too
much
92
the
cea
entitles
kalshi
to
list
its
congressional
control
contracts
for
trading
on
its
market
the
contracts
do
not
involve
any
of
the
activities
enumerated
in
and
are
therefore
not
subject
to
public
interest
review
and
in
any
event
kalshi
contracts
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
93
accordingly
the
court
should
vacate
the
order
prayer
for
relief
now
therefore
kalshi
requests
a
judgment
in
its
favor
as
follows
1
vacating
the
order
2
declaring
that
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
can
be
listed
3
awarding
reasonable
attorneys
fees
and
costs
plus

accruing
thereon

kalshi
sought

control

on

because
those
contracts
do
not
involve
unlawful
activity
terrorism
assassination
war

or
any
similar
activity
that
the
cftc
has
specified
by
regulation
the
commission
had
no
power
to
prohibit
them
nor
are
they
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
any
event
quite
the
opposite
uncertainty
surrounding
political
events
poses
economic
risks
no
less
than
uncertainty
over
oil
supply
hurricanes
or
pandemics
as
hundreds
of
academics
business
owners
and
former
cftc
officials
thus
explained
in
formal
comments
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
enable
hedging
against
economic
risks
associated
with
partisan
control
of
congress
while
generating
valuable
predictive
data
nevertheless
the
cftc
prohibited
kalshi
from
listing
its
contracts
its
order
contorts
and
misapplies
the
cea
text
ignores
its
structure
and
purpose
allows
a
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
and
engages
in
faulty
unsupported
reasoning
it
is
unlawful
and
must
be
vacated
for
three
independent
reasons
first
in
concluding
that
kalshi
contracts
involve
enumerated
activities
the
commission
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
that
word
in
this
statutory
framework
an
event
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
if
its
underlying
event
is
or
closely
relates
to
that
activity
for
example
a
contract
contingent
on
a
terrorist
attack
on
american
soil
would
involve
terrorism
that
intuitive
interpretation
of
involve
makes
sense
of
every
enumerated
activity
and
plainly
does
not
reach
the
contracts
here
the
cftc
instead
claimed
it
can
ban
an
event
contract
if
trading
on
the
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
but
that
construction
violates
basic
interpretive
principles
it
attributes
disparate
meanings
to
a
single
statutory
term
it
renders
the
other
listed
activities
superfluous
it
upends
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
regulated
exchanges
and
it
ultimately
flips
the
statute
default
rule
by
subjecting
all
event
contracts
to
public
interest
scrutiny
second
even
if
the
commission
were
empowered
to
ban
event
contract
trading
that
would
amount
to
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
trading
on
the
contracts
here
would
not
elections
are
not
games
so
trading
contracts
on
them
is
not
gaming
nor
does
the
unlawful
activity
category
empower
states
to
ban
event
contracts
through
their
gambling
statutes
again
the
commission
broader
interpretations
of
these
terms
would
swallow
both
the
rule
and
the
other
enumerated
exceptions
finally
even
if
the
congressional
control
contracts
were
properly
subject
to
public
interest
scrutiny
the
cftc
analysis
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
commission
dismissed
comments
from
renowned
economists
investors
and
business
owners
all
of
whom
confirmed
the
concrete
real
world
hedging
benefits
of
kalshi
contracts
it
instead
improvised
heightened
requirements
that
misunderstand
how
risk
hedging
works
and
ignored
the
evidence
that
kalshi
contracts
meet
even
that
test
on
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
the
commission
merely
offered
unfounded
and
implausible
speculation
about
election
integrity
as
if
the
congressional
control
contracts
create
economic
exposure
to
electoral
outcomes
rather
than
reflect
it
in
short
the
cftc
decision
to
prohibit
kalshi

although

do
use

financial
instruments

capture

forces
few
can
do
so
as
precisely
as
an
event
contract
for
example
a
trader
can
purchase
a
futures
contract
on

stock
index
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
national
economy
will
grow
as
movement
in

index
tends
to
correlate
with
movement
in

but
that
would
be
an
imprecise
way
to
address
whether
the
next
gdp
report
will
actually
show
economic
growth
an
event
contract
on
the
next
gdp
announcement
can
provide
that
targeted
exposure
businesses
and
individuals
use
event
contracts
like
other
derivatives
to
hedge
against
the
risk
of
an
event
happening
ar
1528
for
example
a
beachfront
property
owner
might
buy
contracts
predicting
that
a
hurricane
will
make
landfall
nearby
because
the
payout
from
those
contracts
could
offset
economic
losses
the
owner
is
likely
to
incur
if
a
storm
hits
such
an
event
contract
is
distinct
from
and
serves
a
different
function
than
an
insurance
policy
the
property
owner
could
buy
insurance
to
cover
damage
actually
incurred
from
a
storm
but
unlike
an
event
contract
that
policy
would
not
hedge
the
risk
of
other
losses
associated
with
a
hurricane
hitting
such
as
lost
rental
revenues
or
higher
costs
of
food
and
water
of
course
not
everyone
who
trades
an
event
contract
is
hedging
risk
some
simply
seek
a
return
that
is
true
of
all
derivative
markets
indeed
a
robust
market
depends
in
part
on
the
liquidity
provided
by

for

will

in

might
be
said
to

even
though

not
itself
an
act
of

a
contract
on
whether
a
certain
ceo
will
be
arrested
for

might
be
said
to
involve
unlawful
activity
even
though
the
arrest
is
not
itself
unlawful
in
other
words
congress
could
have
chosen
the
term
involve
to
prevent

through
contracts
that
are

technically
distinct
from

still
closely
related
to

the
intuition
that

is
broader
than
some
alternatives

as
discussed
above
that
interpretation

when

supra

again
defining

that
broadly
would
subject
every

review
because
anyone
who
trades
an
event
contract
is
by
definition
staking
money
on
a
contingency
beyond
his
control
yet
as
justice
holmes
observed
over

it
seems
to
us
an
extraordinary
and
unlikely
proposition
that
the
dealings
which
give
its

yet
resisting
the
overbroad
any

construction
that
would
obviously
upend
the
cea
but
there
is
no
viable
middle
road
here
the
only
workable
construction
of
gaming
requires
the
presence
of
a
game
because
the
congressional
control
contracts
do
not
involve
a
game

trading
them
does
not
amount
to
betting
on
a
game
this
statutory
exception
is
not
implicated
by
kalshi
contracts
trading
congressional
control
contracts
is
also
not
unlawful
activity
the
order
similarly
misreads
the
unlawful
activity
exception
even
under
the
commission
erroneous
reading
of
involve
that
exception
does
not
apply
here
because
buying
or
selling
a
congressional
control
contract
does
not
amount
to
illegal
activity
the
commission
contrary
reasoning
is
incoherent
the
commission
contends
that
purchasing
one
of
kalshi
contracts
would
be
illegal
in
jurisdictions
that
prohibit
betting
on
elections
by
statute
or
common
law
see
order
at

amp

but
those
statutes
can
not
be
construed
to
ban
the
trading
of
event
contracts
on
federally
regulated
exchanges
as
explained
above
the
federal

vests
exclusive
jurisdiction

with
the
general
assumption
that
in
the
absence

congress

is
not
making

to

fail

rendering

surplusage
and
turning
the
principle

on

head
of

congress
is
free
to
forbid
trading
of
political
event
contracts
or
to
authorize
the

to
do
so
it
would
be
as
simple
as
adding
contracts
that
involve
elections
to
the
enumerated
activities

congress

not

the

had
no
authority
to

review
in

because
its
conclusion
that
the

is
erroneous
as
a
matter
of

on

levels
that
is

this

the

that

here
first

misunderstands
the
economic
function
of

the
point
of
hedging
is
to
mitigate
risk
not
like
insurance
to
offset
precise
losses
and
risk
is
all
about
uncertainty
consider
a

acquires
contracts
on
a
hurricane

of

whether
such
a

would
actually
harm
the

where
the
storm
strikes
whether
it
damages
the
hotel
and
whether

indeed
if
the
hurricane
ends
up
hitting

beaches
but
leaving
the
immediate
coastline
untouched
the
hotel
could
bring
in
more
revenue
by
attracting
a
larger
share
of
the
business
but
the
risk
of
loss
climbs
if
a
storm
materializes
at
all
that
risk
warrants
hedging
as
this

it
is

for

the

two
main
reasons
why
kalshi

would
threaten

integrity
a

contracts

supposedly

spark

force

cop
the

fails
to
substantiate
either
aspect
of
this
parade
of
horribles
and
it
ignores
the
contrary
evidence
first
the
order
claims
that
congressional
control
contracts
would
incentivize
manipulation
of
elections
including
by
spreading
misinformation
yet
the

indeed
if

the
unregulated

as

that
host
a
significant

of
these

mitigate
the
issues

the

is
expressing
concern
over

with

is
very
easy
to
see
if
someone
is

immediately
mitigating
the
impact
of
any
short
lived
price
manipulation
and
the
neutral

data
generated
by
a

is
the
best
way
to
mitigate
the
threats
of
misinformation
including
from
the
fake
polls
that
the
cftc
purports
to
worry
about

is
speculative
abstract
and
almost
entirely
absent
from
our

with

more
fundamentally
the
notion
that
a
market
in
kalshi
contracts
would
meaningfully
alter
incentives
to
manipulate
elections
or
to
distribute
misinformation
is
utterly
implausible
given
the
enormous
consequences
of

outcomes
the
massive
sums
already
spent
by
political
campaigns
and
the
sheer
volume
of
inputs

the
national
political
discourse
kalshi

would
at
most
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket
see
ar

that
anyone
buying
these

would
have

incentive

certainly

that
suggestion
is
frankly
absurd
the
cftc
regulates
countless
derivatives
markets
involving
commodities
over
which
it
lacks
independent
expertise
or
authority
for
example
while
the
commission
oversees
trading
in
futures
contracts
on
the

it
does
not
regulate
stocks
that
is
the
job
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
the
cftc
relies
on
to
police
the
underlying
market
likewise
while
the
cftc
supervises
trading
on

based
on
gdp
data
it
is
the
federal
reserve
that
has
responsibility
for

by

token
the

already
shoulder
the

responsibility
of

that
our

contracts

not

thrust

the

certainly
provides
no

otherwise
it
arbitrarily
and
irresponsibly
stokes
fear
about
the
integrity
of

without

introduction
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
grants
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
commission
broad
discretionary
authority
to
determine
whether
certain
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
that
involve
activities
enumerated
in
section
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
applying
the
statute
plain
meaning
the
commission
found
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
contracts
were
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
that
involve
two
enumerated
categories
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
and
gaming
after
the
commission
determined
the
contracts
involved
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
and
gaming
the
commission
considered
whether
the
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
so
doing
the
commission
considered
the
contracts
economic
purpose
and
based
on
the
evidence
before
it
and
using
its
expertise
determined
the
contracts
would
not
be
used
for
hedging
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
the
commission
further
found
that
while
kalshi
and
some
commenters
argued
the
contracts
would
serve
as
a
check
on
misinformation
research
indicated
that
election
markets
may
nonetheless
incentivize
fake
or
unreliable
information
and
thus
impact
either
election
integrity
or
the
public
perception
of
election
integrity
the
commission
considered
that
this
in
turn
would
require
the
commission
to
investigate
election
related
activities
including
potentially
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
and
noted
the
very
serious
concerns
expressed
by
members
of
congress
that
assuming
the
role
of
an
election
cop
may
not
align
with
the
cftc
historic
mission
and
mandate
the
commission
therefore
reasonably
determined
the
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
kalshi
now
asks
this
court
to
overturn
the
commission
reasoned
decision
and
order
that
these
election
betting
contracts
press
kalshi
last
visited
10
2024
be
listed
on
a
federally
regulated
futures
exchange
based
on
a
plainly
mistaken
interpretation
of
section
artificial
and
narrow
definitions
of
involve
and
gaming
and
a
flawed
understanding
of
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
none
of
kalshi
arguments
demonstrates
that
the
commission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
exceeded
its
authority
in
any
way
rather
the
commission
employed
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
broad
terms
of
the
statute
to
determine
that
the
contracts
were
precisely
the
sort
of
event
contracts
that
congress
empowered
the
commission
to
prohibit
kalshi
attacks
on
the
commission
reasoned
judgment
in
determining
that
the
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
further
fall
flat
despite
the
broad
discretion
section
affords
the
commission
in
making
a
public
interest
determination
and
the
deference
due
to
an
agency
expertise
kalshi
protests
the
commission
weighing
of
the
public
interest
considerations
however
as
reflected
in
the
order
the
commission
engaged
in
a
reasoned
analysis
using
its
expertise
and
discretion
considered
the
evidence
before
it
and
evaluated
the
appropriate
factors
to
arrive
at
a
sound
determination
that
kalshi
contracts
were
contrary
to
public
interest
this
court
should
accordingly
affirm
the
commission
order
argument
the
commission
articulated
the
correct
meaning
of
involve
kalshi
argument
that
involve
refers
to
a
contract
underlying
ignores
the
plain
language
of
section
and
is
not
supported
by
statutory
context
section
authorizes
the
commission
to
determine
whether
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
public
interest
and
therefore
prohibited
from
listing
trading
and
clearing
in
commission
regulated
markets
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
certain
enumerated
activities
including
gaming
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
7
emphasis
added
despite
this
plain
language
kalshi
insists
that
the
statute
applies
only
where
a
contract
event
involves
the
activities
enumerated
in
the
statute
kalshi
reply
at
4
arguing
that
involve
to
the
contract
underlying
event
see
also
kalshi
reply
at
6
thus
statutory
text
aside
kalshi
contends
that
the
commission
should
not
have
asked
whether
the
agreement
contracts
or
transactions
involve
an
enumerated
activity
but
only
whether
elections
the
contracts
underlying
event
involve
an
enumerated
activity
building
on
its
argument
that
involve
is
event
based
kalshi
contends
that
it
is
insufficient
for
trading
a
contract
to
relate
to
an
enumerated
activity
kalshi
reply
at
6
kalshi
problem
is
that
section
says
it
is
sufficient
it
applies
where
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
an
enumerated
activity
thus
the
commission
correctly
invoked
section
here
because
taking
a
position
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
trading
or
transacting
in
them
amounts
to
gaming
and
to
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
ar
10
the
analysis
is
similar
if
the
focus
is
on
the
contracts
themselves
rather
than
transactions
in
them
because
it
is
the
contracts
and
not
just
the
underlying
that
may
involve
the
enumerated
activity
the
commission
properly
examined
the
contracts
as
a
whole
ar
7
as
the
commission
correctly
explained
the
contracts
involve
gaming
because
that
is
what
they
are
for
gaming
is
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
of
them
ar
13
either
way
kalshi
interpretation
violates
the
statutory
text
kalshi
reliance
on
the
consistent
meaning
canon
is
misguided
as
a
threshold
matter
canons
of
statutory
interpretation

kalshi

narrowly

here
the

ways
kalshi

suggests
that
the
court
must
narrow
the
meaning
of
involve
so
that
only
one
type
of
connection
qualifies
but
the
presumption
requires
only
that

not
the
narrowest
common
denominator
if
congress
intended
to
apply
section
only
where
the
underlying
event
involves
an
activity
rather
than
more
broadly
when
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
the
activity
it
would
have
said
so
the
commission
order
accords
involve
consistent
meaning
within
section
and
across
the
cea
kalshi
suggests
the
commission
has
conceded
that
involve
means
the
contract
underlying
in
other
provisions
of
the
cea
but
that
mischaracterizes
the
commission
position
the
commission
has
not
taken
the
position
that
involve
in
other
sections
of
the
cea
is
interpreted
to
mean
only
the
underlying
rather
the
commission
noted
that
involve
is
used
throughout
the
cea
to
include
the
underlying
but
is
not
limited
to
the
underlying

the

options
on
commodity
futures
where
the
relevant

contract
would
be
the
underlying
and
the

itself
would
have
a

scrutiny
even

however
it
is
not
surprising
that
a

enacted

naturally
features
overlap
between
the

categories
especially
given
the
deference
provided

potentially
contrary

moreover
kalshi
overly
restrictive

supposed

under

the

is
neither

kalshi
next
contends
that
the
ordinary

because
it
would

in

regard
kalshi
critiques
the

as
contrived
or
as
kalshi
puts
it
gerrymandered
to
avoid
covering
all
event
contracts
but
the
question
before
the

was
whether
kalshi
proposed
contracts
involved
gaming
not
other
contracts
because
transacting

so
clearly
falls
within
the
ordinary

the

decision
was
neither
too

nor

broad
moreover
the
commission
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
basic
statutory
canon
that
statutory
terms
can
not
be
read
in
isolation
and
must
also
be
considered

however
in

the

but
that
argument
overlooks
federal

a
state
can
not
prohibit

all

because
as
the

observed

grants
the

so
while
a
state
is
preempted
from
outlawing

trading
simply
because
someone
thinks
it
resembles
gambling
it
can
prohibit
gambling
on

with
no
obstacle
from
the

that
is
the
sense
in
which
kalshi
proposal
involves
activity
that
violates
state
law
without
regard
to
the
cea
general
preemption
the
question
for
the
commission
was
whether
to
legalize
gambling
activity
that
is
prohibited
by
unpreempted
state
laws
by
allowing
kalshi
to
establish
an

gambling
business
on

the

rationally
determined

by

reasoning
but
for

of

trading
on

would
be

kalshi

at

however
the
commission
careful
application
of
the
cea

is
consistent
with
the
structure
of
the

as
a
whole
while
congress
has
preempted
certain

it
has
also
expressly
stated
the

13
an
inference
from
both
section
6d

and
section
is
that
congress
did
not
want
to
wholly
annihilate

that
may
otherwise

the

the

weighed
the

the

particularly
deferential
in
matters
implicating
predictive

and
interim

the
commission
determination
on
election
integrity
provided
a
reasoned
analysis
and
the
commission
did
not
refuse
to
consider
evidence
kalshi
now
admits
the
commission
would
be
required
to
investigate
manipulative
events
and
realizing
that
its
own
economists
had
conceded
short
term
manipulations
would
happen
argues
that
what
matters
is
long
term
manipulative
events
the
commission
order
focused
on
manipulations
and
the
cea
does
not
distinguish
between
a
short
and
a
long
term
manipulation
the
commission
brief
only
pointed
out
that
the
risk
of
short
term
manipulative
events
as
admitted
by
kalshi
own
economists
alone
supports
the
commission
order
kalshi
completely
misses
the
point
by
arguing
that

of
short

risk
exists

any

overlooking
one
of
the
bases
for

the

instead
the

would
be
driven
by

informational
sources
that

not

ar
21
the
commission
noted
this
difference
in
price
forming

may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating
to
the
trading
and

of

while
decreasing

the

ability

the

there

and
the
commission
expressed
concern
about

moreover
as

the

in
short
the
commission
found
itself
in
the
type
of
situation
where
it
needed
to
forecast
uncertain
future
events
in
such
moments
agencies
are
allowed
to
conduct
a
general
analysis
based
on
informed

and
it
did

here

an

thus
all
that
is
required
here
is
that
even

the

provides
a
statement
of

here
the

engaged

preliminary
statement
before
the
court
is
an
order
of
the
commodity

cftc
which
declined
to
grant
plaintiff
kalshiex
kalshi
permission
to
offer

market
the
proposed
contracts
would
have
enabled
participants
to
take
a
position
on
the
binary
yes
no
question
will
of
be
controlled
by
for
the
cftc
made
three
determinations
in
its
disapproval
of
the
contracts
each
of
which
was
sound
one
it
determined
that
the
contracts
involve
gaming
that
is
betting
wagering
or
gambling
on
elections
two
it
determined
that
the
contracts
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
as
many
states
laws
prohibit
betting
wagering
or
gambling
on
elections
and
three
it
determined
that
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
inter
alia
they
i
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
more
than
occasionally
for
commercial
or
hedging
interests
ii
could
be
used
in
ways
that
adversely
affect
the
integrity
and
perception
of
integrity
of
elections
iii
could
be
manipulated
to
influence
elections
or
electoral
perceptions
and
iv
could
put
the
cftc
in
the
position
of
having
to
investigate
election
related
activities
kalshi

this
court
to
vacate
the
commission
decision
and
order
that
kalshi
election
contracts
be
allowed
to
trade
on
a
regulated
contract
market
the
court
should
instead
rule
in
favor
of
the

was
well
within
its

refuse
to

in
other
words
there
is
a
codified
public
interest
in
regulation
of
derivatives
markets
because
such
markets
provide
a
means
to
hedge
economic
risks
as
it
relates
to
markets
regulated
by
the
commission
hedging
utility
in
derivatives
markets
is
generally
understood
to
be
the
use
by
market
participants
of
derivatives
to
manage
the
various
price
risks
incidental
to
their
commercial
activity
for
instance
airlines
that
need
to
buy
jet
fuel
in
the
foreseeable
future
might
manage
the
risk
that
the
price
will
increase
by
entering
into
a
derivative
contract
a
futures
contract
to
hedge
against
that
risk
it
would
take
a
long
position
a
futures
contract
that
will
increase
in
value
if
the
price
of
the
airline
fuel
increases
on
the
other
hand
a
fuel
supplier
might
manage
the
risk
that
the
price
of
oil
will
decline
by
taking
a
short
position
a
futures
contract
that
will
increase
in
value
if
the
price
of
fuel
goes
down
the
derivatives
markets
also
include
speculators
who
trade
to
profit
from
price
movements
despite
having
no
use
for
the
underlying
commodity
for
instance
a
trader
might
take
long
positions
in
oil
derivatives
simply
based
on
a
view
that
fuel
prices
will
increase
speculators
are
considered
important
because
they
help
ensure
that
hedgers
can
find
counterparties
with
whom
to
trade
a
further
codified

the
regulation

questions

whether

an

whether

how
the

whether

whether

on

at
the
conclusion
of
the
review
period
the
commission
issued
an
order
prohibiting
kalshi
from
listing
the
congressional
control
contracts
for
trading
the
commission
determined
that
the
contracts
involve
two
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
activities
unlawful
under
state
law
the
commission
then
determined
that
the
contracts
were
contrary
to
public
interest
and
as
such
prohibited
them
from
listing
and
trading
ar
1
23
noting
that
involve
is
not
defined
by
statute
for
purposes
of
section
the
commission
looked
to
its
ordinary
meaning
in
analyzing
whether
the
congressional
control
contracts
involve
enumerated
activities
ar
5
the
commission
drew
the
ordinary
meaning
from
multiple
dictionaries
and
determined
that
the
definitions
of
involve
include
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
ar
5
the
commission
rejected
kalshi
proposed
narrower
reading
that
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
only
if
that
activity
is
the
contract
underlying
ar
6
the
commission
noted
that
kalshi
reading
is
inconsistent
with
the
cea
including
section
itself
because
when
the
cea
refers
to
a
contract
underlying
it
uses
the
word
underlying
or
states
what
the
contract
is
based
on
or
based
upon
ar
6
the
commission
reasoned
that
most
notably
section
itself
uses
based
on
to
describe
event
contracts
as
those
based
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
ar
6
thus
the
commission
reasoned
the
only
thing
section
says
about
the
underlying
is
that
it
must
be
a
certain
kind
of
excluded
commodity
an
event
contract
and
not
that
it
must
be
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
ar
6
7
on
these
findings
the
commission
reasoned
that
congress
choice
of
the
broader
term
involve
means
that
cea
section
broadly
captures
both
contracts
whose
underlying
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
contracts
with
a
different
connection
to
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
ar
7
in
finding
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
involve
the
enumerated
activity
of
gaming
the
commission
applied
the
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
to
include
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
ar
8
10
the
commission
reasoned
that
1
dictionaries
define
gaming
to
mean
gambling
2
under
most
state
laws
gambling
involves
staking
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
game
contest
or
contingent
event
3
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
uigea
defines
the
term
bet
or
wager
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
upon
an
agreement
or
understanding
that
the
person
or
another
person
will
receive
something
of
value
in
the
event
of
a
certain
outcome
and
4
state
statutes
link
the
terms
gaming
or
gambling
to
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
ar
8
9
accordingly
because
taking
a
position
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
betting
or
wagering
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
the
contracts
involve
gaming
ar
10
as
to
unlawful
activity
the
commission
found
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
involve
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
because
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
is
prohibited
by
numerous
state
statutes
and
because
several
state
court
decisions
hold
that
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
is
illegal
ar
11
12
the
commission
reasoned
and
kalshi
does
not
contest
that
taking
a
position
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
or
betting
upon
the
outcome
of
contests
between
electoral
candidates
which
is
illegal
in
a
number
of
states
ar
12
13
the
commission
also
explained
that
to
permit
nationwide
election
gambling
would
directly
undermine
important
state
interests
in
controlling
election
gambling
ar
13
having
found
the
contracts
involved
two
enumerated
activities
the
commission
next
evaluated
whether
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
ar
12
the
commission
found
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
are
contrary
to
public
interest
because
of
their
negligible
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
ar
15
19
because
of
their
potential
negative
impact
on
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of

integrity
ar
19
22
and
because
permitting
trading
in
the
contracts
could
require
the
commission
to
assume
a
role
in
overseeing
the
electoral
process
ar

the
commission
also
explained
that
to
permit

would
directly
undermine
important
state
interests
in
controlling

ar
13
in
assessing
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
the
commission
applied
a
form
of
the
economic
purpose
test
supported
by
the
legislative
history
of
cea
section
as
well
as
the
congressional
finding
in

section
3
of
a
national
public
interest
in

regulated

for

entailed

whether
the
contracts
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging

basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis

could
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
predominantly
by

participants

a
commercial
or

interest

19
the
commission
examined
the
contracts
salient
features
considered
the
relevant
comments
and
applied
its
expertise
to
make
a
series
of
findings
ar
15
18
the
commission
found
that
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
does
not
in
and
of
itself
have
sufficiently
direct
predictable
or
quantifiable
economic
consequences
for
the
congressional
control
contracts
to
serve
an
effective
hedging
function

17
the
commission
acknowledged
that
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
may
ultimately
have
economic
effects
but
that
those
eventual
effects
are
diffuse

that

such
that
the
contracts
could
be
useful
for
specific
identifiable
hedging
purposes
ar
17
the
commission
noted
the
specifications
for
the
contract
including
the
binary
nature
of
the
payout
and
the
settlement
only
once
every
two
years
further
limited
the
hedging
capabilities
of
the
contract
ar
17
18
for
these
same
reasons
the
commission
explained
that
the
contracts
could
not
predictably
be
used
for
price
basing
ar
18
19
as
to
election
integrity
the
commission
found
that
the
contracts
could
potentially
adversely
affect
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of
election
integrity
by
creating
monetary
incentives
to
vote
including
as
an
organized
collective
for
particular
candidates
or
by
incentivizing
the
spread
of
misinformation
in
order
to
influence
the
markets
and
that
the
market
could
be
used
to
influence
perceptions
about
elections
the
commission
cited
among
other
things
comment
letters
from
six
united
states
senators
expressing
serious
concerns
along
those
lines
ar
19
20
the
commission
noted
the
difficulty
of
guarding
against
misinformation
and
manipulative
activity
because
the
contracts
have
no
underlying
cash
market
and
instead
the
price
forming
information
is
driven
largely
by
opaque
and
unregulated
sources
such
as
polling
and
voter
surveys
ar
20
21
this
differs
from
the
reliable
informational
sources
such
as
information
in
government
crop
forecasts
that
are
used
to
price
the
vast
majority
of
commodities
underlying
commission
regulated
derivatives
contracts
ar
21
the
commission
found
that
the
contracts
proposed
trading
prohibitions
provided
insufficient
protections
against
manipulative
activities
because
they
do
not
exclude
all
persons
who
could
have
a
motivation
to
manipulate
the
markets
nor
do
they
prevent
the
prohibited
individuals
and
entities
from
engaging
in
activity
other
than
trading
that
could
artificially
move
the
market
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
ar
22
finally
the
commission
found
that
as
a
regulator
of
the
congressional
control
contracts
markets
the
cftc
could
find
itself
in
the
position
of
investigating
suspected
manipulation
of
the
markets
which
could
by
extension
involve
investigating
election
related
activities
ar
22
23
the
commission
observed
that
several
commenters
including
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
noted
that
the
commission
is
not
equipped
or
well
suited
for
this
role
which
falls
well
outside
its
mandate
as
established
by
congress
ar
22
23
in
light
of
these
findings
the
commission
determined
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
involve
gaming
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
and
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
accordingly
the
commission
ordered
that
pursuant
to
cea
section
and
regulation
the
congressional

are
prohibited
and

not
be
listed

summary
of
argument
kalshi
arguments
are
based
overwhelmingly
on
unreasonable
interpretations
of
the
cea
mischaracterizations
of
the
commission
order
straw
men
faulty
logic
and
mistaken
reliance
on
evidentiary
standards
that
apply
to
rulemakings
and
not
individual
adjudications
like
this
one
the
cftc
is
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
for
the
following
reasons
first
the
cftc
correctly
applied
the
ordinary
and
broad
meaning
of
involve
in
determining
whether
the
congressional
control
contracts
and
transactions
therein
involve
an
enumerated
activity
under
cea
section
the
commission
application
of
the
broad
meaning
of
involve
to
include
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
as
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
is
supported
by
dictionary
definitions
the
usage
of
other
terms
in
the
cea
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
statutory
language
of
section
and
is
reinforced
by
multiple
tools
of
construction
kalshi
asserts
that
a
contract
can
only
involve
an
enumerated
activity
when
the
underlying
event
constitutes
or
relates
to
that
activity
this
argument
disregards
the
plain
meaning
of
involve
and
is
not
consistent
with
terms
in
the
cea
kalshi
further
accuses
the
commission
of
using
shifting
definitions
of
involve
but
the
accusation
is
baseless
the
definition
is
not
shifting
it
is
just
broad
which
the
commission
explained
in
its
order
in
a
passage
kalshi
simply
ignores
second
the
commission
correctly
determined
that
the
contracts
involve
gaming
in
so
doing
the
commission
applied
the
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
to
cover
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
including
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
contests
of
others
this
application
is
supported
by
the
use
of
the
terms
gaming
and
gambling
in
both
state
and
federal
statutes
the
purpose
of
the
cea
section
and
the
legislative
history
of
cea
section
the
commission
then
correctly
concluded
that
the
contracts
involve
gaming
pursuant
to
section
because
taking
a
position
in
the
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
contest
of
others
where
the
contracts
are
premised
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
kalshi
argues
that
gaming
does
not
cover
betting
on
elections
and
only
narrowly
covers
activities
that
involve
a
game
such
as
playing
cards
or
betting
on
a
football
match
this
narrow
reading
contradicts
kalshi
own
view
that
a
contract
only
involves
gaming
if
the
underlying
is
gam
ing
as
opposed
to
a
game
like
football
and
is
in
any
event
not
supported
by
the
other
statutes
kalshi
cites
or
section
or
its
legislative
history
third
the
commission
correctly
determined
that
the
contracts
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
law
the
commission
found
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
involve
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
an
activity
the
commission
observed
is
unlawful
under
numerous
state
laws
because
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
contests
between
electoral
candidates
is
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
of
transacting
in
the
contracts
kalshi
does
not
challenge
these
findings
but
instead
argues
that
the
commission
analysis
threatens
to
undermine
its
own
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
regulatory
authority
over
derivatives
markets
by
permitting
states
to
dictate
trading
prohibitions
by
simply
outlawing
activity
this
argument
is
without
merit
because
contracts
that
involve
enumerated
activities
are
subject
to
prohibition
only
if
the
commission
in
its
discretion
determines
they
are
contrary
to
public
interest
fourth
the
commission
rationally
considered
the
contracts
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
in
determining
whether
the
congressional
control
contracts
are
contrary
to
public
interest
the
commission
use
of
an
economic
purpose
test
is
supported
by
the
text
of
the
cea
and
the
relevant
legislative
history
fifth
the
commission
reasonably
determined
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
could
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
or
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
this
determination
was
based
on
the
commission
analysis
of
the
relevant
facts
and
application
of
its
expertise
kalshi
wastes
pages
of
its
brief
disputing
a
conclusion
the
commission
did
not
reach
that
the
contracts
could
never
be
used
by
anyone
to
hedge
a
risk
but
nothing
that
kalshi
cites
undermines
the
commission
judgment
that
even
considering
kalshi
assertions
of
certain
narrow
hedging
uses
the
contracts
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
or
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
sixth
the
commission
reasonably
determined
the
contracts
may
be
vulnerable
to
manipulative
efforts
and
such
events
or
efforts
could
undermine
perception
of
the
integrity
of
elections
the
integrity
of
those
elections
and
put
the
commission
in
a
role
that
is
misaligned
with
the
commission
mission
the
specifications
of
the
contract
the
lack
of
an
underlying
cash
market
and
the
record
including
the
opinions
of
economists
that
kalshi
cites
all
point
to
a
contract
that
could
be
manipulated
especially
in
short
bursts
kalshi
argues
that
the
commission
did
not
consider
kalshi
proposed
public
interest
of
socially
valuable
data
but
that
is
not
true
the
commission
acknowledged
that
claim
but
reasonably
chose
to
weigh
that
interest
against
other
factors
including
the
potential
for
manipulative
events
which
could
affect
confidence
in
or
the
even
the
outcome
of
elections
and
the
possibility
that
the
commission
would
be
drawn
into
investigations
of
manipulative
events
in
elections
the
commission
made
a
predictive
policy
decision

kalshi

that

if
anything
kalshi
is
now

kalshi
argues
that
a

if
the
underling

the

therefore
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
of
the

and
should
not
be
disturbed
nevertheless
kalshi
argues
that
when
applied
the
commission
definition
of

when
combined
with
its
interpretation
of

affords
the
cftc
a
roving
mandate
to
review
and
potentially
to
ban
any
event
contract
kalshi
motion
at
19
but
as
discussed
below
this
argument
relies
on
kalshi
mischaracterization
of
the
commission
order
as
defining
gaming
to
include
all
event
contracts
see
infra
at
27
28
because
the
commission
did
not
define
gaming
in
this
way
the
argument
is
without
merit
finally
kalshi
challenges
the
commission
application
of
involve
as
making
a
hash
of
the
unlawful
activity
provision
as
it
relates
to
both
federal
law
and
state
law
this
argument
is
also
a
mischaracterization
of
the
commission
order
specifically
kalshi
argues
as
though
the
commission
were
defining
involve
with
regard
to
unlawful
activity
as
meaning
that
the
act
of
trading
the
contract
itself
must
be
unlawful
on
that
false
premise
kalshi
goes
on
to
argue
that
under
this
definition
the
commission
authority
to
engage
in
a
public
interest
review
is
meaningless
because
congress
had
no
need
to
authorize
public
interest
review
of
contracts
whose
trading
is
already
illegal
under
federal
law
and
any
state
law
banning
trading
would
be
preempted
by
the
cea
kalshi
motion
at
20
but
again
that
is
not
what
the
commission
said
the
commission
did
not
define
involve
for
purposes
of
unlawful
activity
to
mean
that
the
trading
itself
must
be
unlawful
as
noted
the
commission
applied
the
ordinary
meaning
of
involve
to
mean
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
as
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
and
under
this
definition
the
commission
could
review
event
contracts
that
have
other
connections
to
unlawful
activities
for
example
the
commission
could
review
a
contract
that
involves
the
unlawful
activity
of
narcotics
trafficking
in
the
sense
that
the
contract
payout
depends
on
whether
a
certain
amount
of
cocaine
is
seized
by
federal
or
state
authorities
in
a
given
month
accordingly
kalshi
argument
that
the
commission
rendered
its
own
authority
meaningless
is
without
merit
the
commission
correctly
determined
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
involve
gaming
the
commission
determination
that
the
congressional
control
contract
involve
gaming
for
purposes
of

section
was
properly
based
on
the
application
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
to
include
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
in
explaining
its
decision
the
commission
that
a
common
thread
throughout
the
large
majority
of
definitions
of
gaming
and
gambling
is
the
act
of
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others

subject
on
which
futures
contracts
traditionally
have
not
been

kalshi
does
not
dispute
that
taking
a
position
in
the
congressional

contracts
is
betting
or
wagering
on

because
kalshi
does
not
contest

instead
kalshi
argues
without
basis
that
this
does
not
amount
to
gaming
because

are
not
a
game
which
is
different
from
gaming
anyway
nor
a

the
sense
congress
intended
kalshi
further
argues
gaming
and
gambling
have
different
meanings
that
gaming
can
not
include
wagers
based
on
contests
and
that
if
gaming
includes
wagers
based
on

the
contests
must
be
staged
purely
for
entertainment
none
of
that
has
any
basis
in

this

should
reject
kalshi
arguments

the

did
not
construe

to
mean
the
staking

its
case
by
suggesting
the
order

to
include
staking
money
on
any
contingent
event
beyond
the
parties

such
that
every

kalshi
fixates

a

that
says
a

if

it
amounts
to
gaming

repeats
the

construction
of

an

contract
based
on
who

be

the

is

in

the
words
gaming

gambling
in
statutes
are
similar
in
meaning
and
referring
to
both
state
laws

define
gambling

the
staking
something

a

thus
the
commission
found
that
staking
something
of
value
on

amounts
to
gaming

this
and
it
was
entirely
reasonable
for
the

to

that

does
not
challenge
the

factual
findings
that
the
features
of
the

undermine
them
as

basing
tools
as
the
commission
observed
the
congressional
control
contracts
result
upon
settlement
in
a
payout
of
1
or
0

contract
only
once
every
two
years
coinciding
with
the

cycle
and
unlike

the
payout
on
the

is
not
in
any
way
tied
to
actual
or
estimated
losses
incurred
elsewhere
and
a
loss
on
the

is
not
offset
by
a
gain
elsewhere
thus
the
commission
concluded
the
binary
payout
and
frequency
of

of
the

limit
their
utility
as
a

for

economic

asserts
that
the
commission
application
of
the
economic
purpose
test
amounted
to
arbitrarily
heightened
standard

that

kalshi

this
is
not
true
in
considering
hedging
utility
the
commission
examined
whether
there
were
any
economic
effects
of
control
of
one
chamber
of
congress
including
indirect
effects
advanced
by
kalshi
and
commenters
that
the
contracts
might
be
used
to
hedge
at
the
outset
the
commission
made
the
common
sense
point
that
control
of
one
chamber
did
not
itself
have
sufficiently
direct
predictable
or
quantifiable
economic
consequences
ar
15
the
commission
then
turned
to
eventual
indirect
effects
that
kalshi
and
the
commenters
cited
ar
16
the
commission
determined
such
effects
were
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
establish
a
specific
identifiable
hedging
or
price
basing
purpose
for
the
contracts
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
ar
15
16
as
the
commission
observed
the
eventual
economic
effects
were
related
to
potential
legislative
policy
changes
the
commission
acknowledged
that
the
likelihood
of
adoption
of
a
given
policy
may
increase
or
decrease
based
on
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
but
reasonably
observed
that
many
intervening
events
and
variables
exist
between
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
and
the
actual
implementation
of
such
a
policy
ar
16
this
is
because
as
the
commission
noted
there
are
several
steps
required
to
enact
and
implement
legislation
the
likelihood
of
which
does
not
depend
on
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
alone
ar
16
17
implementation
also
depends
on
for
example
whether
a
party
controls
one
or
both
chambers
the
size
of
its
majority
the
votes
by
individual
party
members
and
the
political
affiliation
of
the
president
among
other
factors
ar
16
thus
the
commission
reasonably
concluded
the
cited
potential
economic
effects
of
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
were
insufficient
to
demonstrate
that
the
contracts
had
a
specific
identifiable
hedging
purpose
or
that
they
could
be
used
to
establish
commercial
transaction
prices
as
necessary
to
satisfy
the
economic

test
kalshi
points
to
a

than

but
more
fundamentally
nowhere
does
kalshi
engage
with
the
question
of
whether
that
hedging
function
would
be
its
predominant
use
or
whether
the
identified
hedging
function
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
when
all
indications
are
as
common

and
new
stories
on

own
website
dictate
the
proposed
markets
are
simply
a
form
of

gambling
to
resist
the
obvious
kalshi
points
to
a
hypothetical

deep
ties

party

kalshi
motion
at

kalshi
argues
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
could
be
used
by
the
hypothetical
firm
to
hedge
this
risk
and
by
others
to
determine
the
firm
value
i
d
kalshi
neither
quantifies
these
hypothetical
effects
nor
demonstrates
how
they
would
support
more
than
occasional
hedging
or
price
basing
utility
which
on
their
face
they
could
not
and
kalshi
own
2022
submission
undermines
any
assertion
of
a
hypothetical
hedging
need
because
it
notes
political
consulting
firms
are
careful
to
bill
themselves
as
bi
partisan
in
light
of
the
importance
of
political
connections
to
their
business
ar
3001
at
nevertheless
even
if
the
consulting
firm
kalshi
describes
were
rooted
in
fact
it
would
do
nothing
to
undermine
the
commission
rational
judgment
that
the
contracts
are
predominantly
for
gambling
not
hedging
kalshi
also
cites
examples
of
specific
assets
whose
value
is
directly
linked
to
partisan
control
to
argue
that
congressional
control
has
predictable
effects
on
equity
prices
but
kalshi
examples
are
observations
of
isolated
movements
in
stock
prices
or
firm
valuations
not
predictable
patterns
or
repeated
occurrences
of
economic
effects
in
any
particular
asset
price
and
as
noted
above
the
contracts
only
apply
to
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
kalshi
does
not
point
to
any
particular
commercial
transaction
price
that
would
be
based
on
or
include
the
price
of
the
congressional
control
contracts
to
support
an
argument
the
contracts
would
serve
a
price
basing
function
nor
does
the
record
support
such
a
finding
for
these
reasons
kalshi
has
not
demonstrated
that
there
is
a
frequency
of
movement
in
any
asset
that
could
support
more
than
occasional
hedging
or
price
basing
even
if
some
of
the
price
movements
kalshi
cites
could
be
tied
to
an
election
result
the
commission
was
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
addressing
comments
finally
kalshi
argues
that
the
commission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
it
refused
to
engage
with
commenters
who
provided
probative
and
compelling
evidence
of
the
contracts
hedging
purpose
kalshi
motion
at
39
but
as
discussed
above
kalshi
argument
in
this
regard
is
based
on
a
research
mistake
kalshi
relies
almost
entirely
on
cases
addressing
the
apa
requirements
for
rulemaking
not
informal
adjudication
contrary
to
kalshi
suggestion
the
commission
was
not
required
to
specifically
respond
to
each
and
every
comment
that
might
be
construed
as
contrary
to
its
position
even
in
notice
and
comment
rulemaking
the
agency
need
only
respond
to
significant
points
raised
by
the
public
and
an
agency
failure
to
address
a

it
also
appears

that
for
these

it
is
better
for
the
house
to
be
regulated
by
the
cftc
than
a

commission
kalshi

analogize

in
arguing
that
creating
a
financial
instrument
regulated

a

regulator
would
not
affect
the
legitimacy
of
the

specifically
kalshi
argues
that
no
one
questions
the

of
the
election
of
margaret
thatcher
or
tony
blair
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
the
uk

markets
first
of
all
even
if
true
prime
ministers
thatcher
and
blair
last
stood
for
election
in
1987
and
2005
respectively
by
contrast
conspiracy
theories
abound
concerning
the
2016
brexit
vote
and
importantly
the
uk
derivatives
markets
are
overseen
by
the
financial
conduct
authority
or
prudential
regulation
authority
and
those
authorities
will
prosecute
manipulation
in
those
markets
but
betting
on
prime
ministers
is
separate
those
markets
are
regulated
by
the
uk
gambling
commission
which
does
not
have
any
requirement
that
a

about

in

if

are
traded

the

kalshi
argues
that
the

kalshi

may
incentivize
the

of

unreliable

in
the
interest
of

and
that
for
example
certain
individuals
and
entities
who
would
not
by
the
terms

be
permitted
to

them
such
as

the

outweighed
the

is
reasonable
and
within

does
not
settle

nevertheless
barring

the

ecf

cftc
br
the
commission
advances
arguments
that
are
if
anything
even
less
coherent
than
those
in
its
order
neither
the
brief
length
nor
its
volume
of
footnotes
can
conceal
its
lack
of
substance
on
the
key
controlling
issues
in
this
case
first
the
commission
fundamentally
misunderstands
what
the
statute
means
when
it
refers
to
event
contracts
that
involve
the
enumerated
activities
the
cftc
acknowledges
that
for
most
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
question
is
whether
the
contract
underlying
event
involves
the
activity
but
for
gaming
and
unlawful
only
for
those
activities
the
commission
insists
the
question
becomes
whether
trading
the
contract
involves
the
activity
those
are
two
totally
different
inquiries
the
commission
identifies
no
other
statute
that
employs
language
in
such
a
shape
shifting
way
using
a
single
term
in
a
single
sentence
to
repeatedly
toggle
back
and
forth
between
two
different
subjects
this
reading
flies
in
the
face
of
basic
interpretive
principles
and
also
upends
the
basic
structure
of
the
scheme
second
the
commission
initial
wrong
turn
forces
it
down
other
blind
alleys
it
claims
that
buying
or
selling
kalshi
contracts
involves
gaming
but
there
is
no
game
here
only
real
world
events
with
real
economic
impacts
nor
can
the
cftc
construe
gaming
broadly
to
mean
all
gambling
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
since
that
would
sweep
in
all
event
contracts
making
nonsense
of
the
statutory
enumeration
the
commission
admits
as
much
attempting
to
steer
between
that
scylla
and
charybdis
it
gerrymanders
a
novel
definition
of
gaming
to
cover
wagers
on
games
or
contests
but
nothing
else
the
commission
can
not
and
does
not
explain
however
why
that
neither
here
nor
there
interpretation
is
the
best
reflection
of
congressional
intent
as
opposed
to
the
best
way
to
ensnare
kalshi
contracts
which
appears
to
be
the
commission
sole
objective
and
the
games
or
contests
construction
fails
even
on
that
score
since
elections
are
plainly
not
contests
under
the
state
gambling
statutes
upon
which
the
commission
rests
the
cftc
attempt
to
condemn
kalshi
contracts
as
involving
unlawful
activity
requires
even
stranger
contortions
it
argues
that
this
category
is
implicated
because
some
states
prohibit
betting
on
elections
but
as
the
order
itself
observed
many
states
ban
all
wagering
on
contingencies
on
the
commission
logic
every
event
contract
thus
involves
unlawful
activity
in
just
the
same
way
as
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
do
despite
some
nearly
unintelligible
denials
the
commission
effectively
admits
as
much
it
thereby
turns
the
statutory
scheme
on
its
head
and
effectively
reinstates
the
across
the
board
pre
clearance
regime
that
congress
repealed
decades
ago
that
can
not
be
right
finally
the
commission
efforts
to
prop
up
the
order
public
interest
finding
fall
flat
it
is
undeniable
that
elections
impact
people
and
businesses
indeed
hardly
any
other
events
matter
as
much
as
elections
do
and
if
elections
matter
the
risks
associated
with
them
can
be
hedged
that
simple
reality
is
more
than
enough
to
align
kalshi
contracts
with
the
public
interest
in
its
brief
the
commission
only
doubles
down
on
the
order
analytical
errors
it
ignores
the
mountains
of
concrete
evidence
of
the
contracts
benefits
while
repeating
irrelevant
platitudes
about
election
integrity
which
kalshi
wholeheartedly
supports
and
elevating
unfounded
bogeyman
claims
that
have
no
basis
in
fact
the
commission
tries
to
hide
behind
the
formality
that
the
order
resulted
from
an
informal
adjudication
but
that
is
no
excuse
for
arbitrary
and
capricious
reasoning
the
cftc
chose
to
ask
for
the
public
input
but
then
ignored
it
when
the
facts
did
not
fit
the
commission
pre
ordained
agenda
of
protecting
wall
street
monopoly
over
risk
hedging
financial
products
in
the
end
it
is
clear
that
this
court
must
vacate
the
order
and
permit
kalshi
to
list
the
congressional
control
contracts
to
the
extent
congress
determines
that
election
contracts
should
be
banned
it
remains
free
to
add
elections
to
the
list
of
enumerated
activities
that
trigger
cftc
review
but
current
law
is
clear
and
the
commission
can
not
twist
or
rewrite
it
to
protect
an
incumbent
hegemony
kalshi
is
therefore
entitled
to
summary
judgment
and
respectfully
reiterates
its
request
for
a
ruling
to
that
effect
in
advance
of
the
next
set
of
federal
elections
argument
the
cftc
is
wrong
about
what
it
means
for
an
event
contract
to
involve
an
enumerated
activity
under
the
only
consistent
coherent
interpretation
of
the
cea
event
contract
provision
kalshi
contracts
involve
neither
gaming
nor
unlawful
activity
at
the
threshold
that
is
because
the
word
involve
read
in
its
statutory
context
links
the
enumerated
activities
to
a
contract
event
to
the
act
of
trading
it
this
event
focused
reading
makes
sense
of
each
enumerated
activity
and
accommodates
the
statute
broader
structure
meanwhile
the
commission
contrary
reading
under
which
involve
refers
to
the
underlying
event
for
some
enumerated
activities
but
to
the
act
of
trading
for
the
gaming
and
unlawful
activity
categories
does
not
fit
no
matter
how
broad
a
single
statutory
term
in
a
single
sentence
can
not
perform
two
completely
different
tasks
simultaneously
and
basic
principles
of
statutory
construction
confirm
that
involve
here
must
refer
to
the
underlying
event
lest
every
event
contract
be
subjected
to
public
interest
scrutiny

after
congress

repealed
that
regime
and
curtailed
the
commission

activities

not
with

the
commission
never
disputes
that
for
the
terrorism
assassination
and
war
categories
an
event
contract
can
involve
those
activities
only
if
its
underlying
event
relates
to
them
and
the
commission
concedes
that
the
cea

uses
the
term

do
the
same
work

the
commission
never
suggests
that
elections
involve
gaming

it
argues
only
that

involves
those
activities
the
commission
occasionally
disputes
that
description
of
its
position

its
brief
like
the

for
itself

the

does
again
the
dispute
is
not
about
how
closely
an

of

it
is
about
whether
it
suffices
for

an

the
latter
inquiry
has
no
basis
in
the

the
problem
with
the

reading
is
even
starker
when
it
comes
to
unlawful
activity
because
multiple
states

ban
wagering

any

construing
involve

this
time
the

principle
to

that
result

it
denies
reading

that
the

itself

but
while

treats

indeed
that
is
the
only
way
the

can
cram

the

the
cftc
attacks
on

fail
unable
to
defend
its
own
reading
of

the

goes
after
kalshi
it
starts
by
making
a
textual
argument
that
once

mischaracterizes
kalshi

and
it
continues
by
claiming
that
kalshi

is
at
odds
with
a
snippet
of

both
gambits
fail
on
the

the

points
out
that

in

again
however
the
commission
is
attacking
a
straw
man
kalshi
agrees
that

its
typical
meaning

which
is
broader
than

to
use
the
commission
example
a
contract
that
pays
out
based
on
whether
a
certain
amount
of
cocaine
is
seized
by
authorities
might
not
be
based
upon
illegal
activity
since
the
seizure
itself
would
be
legal
the
contract
event
would
still
relate
to
unlawful
activity
cftc
br
26
kalshi
agrees
but
none
of
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
question
here
which
is
whether
it
is
the
underlying
event
or
the
act
of
trading
that
must
involve
the
activity
for
example
does
an

contract

involve

because

bizarrely
inconsistent

ii
the
cftc
reading
of
the

is
untenable
even
accepting
the

erroneous
reading
of

kalshi
still
prevails
first
trading
kalshi
contracts
does
not
involve
gaming
because
traders
take
positions
on
elections
not
games
the
commission
attempt
to
expand
gaming
to
cover
wagers
on
nothing
else
has
no
basis
in
law
or
common
sense
and
kalshi
contracts
are
not
covered
by
that
definition
anyway
second
the
act
of
trading
kalshi
contracts
does
not
involve
unlawful
activity
because
federal
law
preempts
state
law
in
this
sphere
the
commission
argument
to
the
extent
it
is
comprehensible
hinges
on
a
reading
of
unlawful
activity
that
subjects
every
event
contract
to
public
interest
review
which
is
obviously
untenable
gaming
requires
a
game
as
kalshi
explained
in
its
opening
brief
gaming
ordinarily
means
playing
games

it
can

elections
are
not
games
so
event
contracts
contingent
on

can
not
fairly
be
said
to
involve
gaming
kalshi
br
27
as
a
matter
of
ordinary
meaning
gaming
is
too
narrow
to
encompass
kalshi
contracts
the
order
observed
that
some
dictionaries
connect
gaming
with
gambling
and
then
pointed
to
some
definitions
of
gambling
that
sweep
in
any
and
all
wagers
on
uncertain
contingencies
see

but
that
approach
treating
gaming
as
a
catchall
for
anything
colloquially
described
as
gambling
or
sweep
every
event
contract
into
this
category

and
it
hard
to
imagine
a
less
reasonable
construction

than
one
that
consumes
each
of

the
general

this
interpretation
is
too
broad
to
serve
the
commission
objectives
accordingly
the
cftc
devises
a
made

definition
just
broad
enough
to
reach
kalshi
contracts
but
just
narrow
enough
not
to

its
view
gaming
reaches
everything
covered

staking
something
of

the

to
be
that

for

so
if

then
every

equally
involves

the

good
afternoon
everyone
so
we
are
here
on
the
parties
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
i
do
typically
have
oral
argument
although
i
thought
this
was
a
case
where
argument
would
be
helpful
to
me
in
resolving
the
motions
i
do
know
who
arguing
for
plaintiff
is
there
a
time
sensitivity
in
this
case
i
know
there
not
a
pi
that
been
filed
but
i
just
trying
to
understand
mr
roth
it
was
actually
the
first
thing
i
was
going
to
say
was
thank
you
for
hearing
argument
on
motions
we
have
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction
but
there
is
time
some
time
sensitivity
because
the
contracts
are
tied
to
the
november
elections
so
what
we
would
like
ideally
is
a
resolution
that
would
allow
if
needed
for
appellate
intervention
so
that
the
contracts
can
be
listed
prior
to
that
election
the
court
that
was
my
preliminary
question
all
right
i
will
start
with
plaintiff
i
may
interrupt
with
some
questions
but
otherwise
will
try
to
restrain
myself
to
listen
to
your
presentation
mr
roth
great
thank
you
so
much
your
honor
so
as
your
honor
knows
we
filed
this
case
because
the
commission
blocked
kalshi
from
listing
its
event
contracts
that
turn
on
partisan
control
of
the
house
and
the
senate
and
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
that
agency
action
complies
with
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
the
apa
and
we
reproduced
on
a
slide
here
the
text
of
the
key
statutory
provision
from
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
as
you
see
it
authorizes
the
commission
to
block
prohibit
the
listing
of
event
contract
if
two
elements
are
satisfied
first
the
contract
has
to
involve
one
of
the
six
enumerated
categories
of
activities
and
then
if
it
does
the
commission
may
determine
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
which
case
it
prohibited
so
far
i
do
think
that
a
point
of
dispute
that
just
what
the
statute
says
following
that
framework
our
challenge
here
has
two
basic
components
first
we
do
dispute
that
kalshi
contracts
fall
within
the
scope
of
those
six
any
of
those
six
enumerated
categories
and
that
really
just
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
then
the
second
piece
is
that
we
argue
that
even
assuming
the
contracts
did
fall
within
one
of
those
categories
that
commission
public
interest
analysis
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
court
i
know
i
said
i
was
going
to
restrain
myself
but
can
i
ask
just
a
preliminary
question
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
because
of
this
two
step
framework
that
the
statute
sets
forth
that
if
it
not
in
i
say
enumerated
although
the
last
one
is
a
catchall
in
not
one
of
these
categories
then
you
do
even
get
to
public
interest
i
noticed
in
your
brief
you
had
outlined
some
of
the
safeguards
that
you
client
has
put
in
into
place
with
respect
to
this
contract
in
particular
for
example
paid
members
of
congressional
staff
are
permitted
to
trade
other
safeguards
i
assuming
that
your
client
thought
those
were
important
to
maintain
integrity
of
the
process
mr
roth
correct
the
court
but
under
your
argument
because
elections
do
fall
according
to
you
in
these
categories
there
no
occasion
for
cftc
to
even
reach
those
safeguards
so
presumably
someone
could
post
an
event
contract
similarly
to
what
your
client
does
another
dcm
could
do
this
without
any
of
those
safeguards
and
it
my
understanding
that
under
your
framework
cftc
would
not
have
any
interest
in
that
mr
roth
i
agree
that
it
would
be
relevant
to
whether
it
falls
within
one
of
these
statutory
categories
and
therefore
this
provision
would
not
capture
it
what
i
not
sure
about
and
what
i
can
ask
is
whether
there
are
other
regulations
or
provisions
that
may
the
court
come
into
play
mr
roth
yeah
that
may
speak
to
issues
like
that
like
who
allowed
to
trade
on
it
are
there
certain
restrictions
beyond
this
sort
of
in
or
out
provision
which
is
just
it
either
allowed
or
it
not
allowed
the
court
on
a
similar
vein
i
understood
one
of
your
positions
to
be
look
this
is
a
contract
involving
control
of
the
house
it
not
talking
about
a
discrete
election
between
two
candidates
there
are
so
many
intervening
factors
that
have
to
occur
before
not
even
intervening
factors
but
it
not
often
dispositive
of
one
election
who
controls
the
chamber
under
your
framework
though
would
a
dcm
be
able
to
post
an
event
contract
for
a
presidential
election
mr
roth
yes
the
court
okay
so
that
piece
is
responsive
or
relevant
to
what
your
point
about
this
being
a
house
about
control
of
the
house
and
that
it
not
you
know
a
two
party
or
two
candidate
election
there
a
lot
of
moving
parts
what
is
that
relevant
to
mr
roth
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way
the
court
okay
mr
roth
if
you
imagine
that
there
was
a
category
on
this
list
that
said
elections
the
court
okay
mr
roth
then
i
think
one
could
still
say
that
these
contracts
involve
elections
even
though
it
one
step
removed
from
the
election
itself
the
court
okay
mr
roth
which
goes
to
an
issue
that
was
sort
of
debated
in
the
briefs
which
is
does
it
have
been
to
be
literally
the
underlying
event
or
does
it
have
to
does
this
underlying
event
just
have
to
relate
to
the
category
we
agree
it
enough
that
it
relates
to
the
category
so
if
you
had
the
category
that
said
elections
even
though
this
was
a
couple
steps
removed
i
think
you
could
say
it
would
relate
to
elections
and
therefore
fall
within
the
scope
our
main
argument
though
is
it
does
say
elections
the
court
all
right
continue
please
mr
roth
okay
what
i
was
going
to
say
before
moving
on
was
i
going
to
be
speaking
to
the
statutory
interpretation
piece
of
the
argument
and
my
colleague
amanda
rice
is
going
to
be
speaking
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
piece
when
i
done
looking
to
the
enumerated
categories
we
can
sort
of
simplify
by
taking
four
of
them
off
the
list
right
off
the
bat
the
last
one
as
your
honor
noted
is
a
catchall
the
commission
is
essentially
allowed
to
add
categories
by
rule
if
they
similar
to
the
listed
five
the
commission
has
done
that
so
we
can
sort
of
cross
that
one
off
the
list
for
now
and
then
obviously
the
commission
does
not
argue
that
these
contracts
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
they
do
think
involve
is
very
broad
but
not
broad
enough
to
get
them
quite
that
far
so
we
can
strike
two
three
and
four
from
the
list
as
well
and
that
leaves
the
two
enumerated
categories
that
the
commission
focuses
on
which
are
number
1
unlawful
activity
and
then
number
five
gaming
and
i
like
to
take
them
in
that
order
which
is
the
order
they
appear
in
the
statute
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
starting
with
the
unlawful
activity
the
way
we
understand
that
is
that
it
refers
to
contracts
where
the
underlying
event
relates
to
some
unlawful
act
okay
so
for
example
if
you
had
a
contract
on
whether
the
murder
rate
in
2024
is
going
exceed
a
certain
level
if
you
had
a
contract
on
whether
a
particular
piece
of
art
in
the
national
gallery
is
going
to
be
stolen
within
a
period
of
time
those
are
unlawful
acts
if
you
had
a
contract
on
those
events
it
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
number
one
i
think
it
fits
the
text
and
i
think
it
fits
the
context
of
the
statute
and
that
sort
of
an
important
point
it
aligns
it
with
the
terrorism
assassination
and
war
provisions
that
immediately
follow
it
if
you
think
about
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
common
denominator
is
they
bad
those
are
things
we
do
they
bad
things
congress
is
concerned
about
people
profiting
from
bad
things
and
about
incentives
to
do
bad
things
right
using
my
hypothetical
of
the
murder
rate
you
do
want
somebody
to
go
hire
a
hit
man
to
get
the
rate
above
a
level
so
you
can
make
money
bad
incentives
it
also
just
feels
offensive
to
have
people
profiting
from
you
know
there
was
a
terrorist
attack
i
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money
from
that
that
sort
of
the
gist
of
2
3
and
4
if
you
read
1
the
way
we
read
1
it
lines
up
perfectly
with
that
we
do
want
to
incentivize
crime
we
do
want
to
have
people
profiting
from
crime
so
it
all
parallel
and
of
course
that
interpretation
does
sweep
in
kalshi
contracts
elections
are
not
unlawful
they
do
even
relate
to
unlawful
activity
so
now
let
consider
the
commission
interpretation
as
i
understand
it
on
this
prong
what
they
saying
is
some
states
prohibit
betting
on
elections
either
as
part
of
their
gambling
statutes
or
in
stand
alone
provisions
and
the
commission
admits
that
those
state
laws
do
directly
apply
in
the
sense
that
they
ca
prohibit
trading
on
a
regulated
exchange
because
of
preemption
principles
but
the
way
i
understand
what
they
arguing
is
that
they
say
well
buying
and
selling
those
contracts
sort
of
amounts
to
a
betting
on
an
election
because
you
staking
something
of
value
on
the
electoral
outcome
if
you
did
that
outside
the
context
of
a
regulated
exchange
then
it
would
violate
these
state
laws
and
therefore
the
trading
of
the
contract
relates
to
unlawful
activity
so
a
couple
problems
with
that
number
one
unlike
our
interpretation
it
does
align
with
the
three
that
follow
it
because
the
key
move
that
they
making
there
is
instead
of
looking
at
the
underlying
event
and
whether
it
is
related
to
the
enumerated
activity
they
looking
at
the
trading
of
the
contract
and
whether
it
related
to
the
underlying
activity
that
is
a
sort
of
just
a
different
focus
of
the
analysis
and
it
makes
1
sort
of
stand
out
relative
to
2
3
and
4
the
court
can
i
ask
you
about
that
because
i
think
that
this
defendant
made
this
point
the
government
made
this
point
where
it
says
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involved
what
work
do
you
argue
transactions
is
doing
in
the
statute
as
it
relates
to
involve
mr
roth
as
i
understand
it
the
agreement
contract
or
transaction
sort
of
triplet
it
appears
throughout
the
statute
it
just
the
way
they
refer
to
these
types
of
instruments
when
they
define
it
so
i
do
think
that
they
have
independent
significance
i
think
they
just
capturing
any
different
way
you
might
structure
the
arraignment
the
court
so
you
not
reading
transactions
to
refer
to
the
act
of
trading
the
thing
it
another
way
to
say
contract
agreement
it
is
the
contract
itself
mr
roth
it
the
instrument
and
i
think
that
follows
from
the
fact
that
this
is
how
it
used
throughout
the
statute
the
three
together
and
just
to
be
clear
we
not
saying
that
you
could
have
a
statute
that
said
transaction
involving
x
where
what
it
meant
was
the
act
of
contracting
it
involves
that
activity
it
not
that
that
semantically
impossible
it
grammatically
appropriate
it
makes
sense
it
just
that
it
does
line
up
with
the
way
the
statute
works
for
2
3
and
4
and
so
it
makes
it
just
an
unusual
sort
of
strange
way
of
speaking
the
hypothetical
i
was
thinking
about
as
i
was
preparing
you
could
say
my
lunch
generally
involves
a
sandwich
a
salad
a
pastry
or
robust
conversation
with
my
work
colleagues
you
could
say
that
and
yes
it
could
involve
those
things
but
putting
them
together
in
that
way
is
weird
it
not
the
way
people
normally
speak
but
i
actually
do
think
that
the
most
problematic
aspect
of
the
commission
reading
of
the
unlawful
category
i
think
the
most
serious
problem
with
it
and
the
one
that
really
is
i
think
fatal
is
that
it
proves
way
too
much
because
as
the
commission
observes
elsewhere
in
the
briefing
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
states
that
prohibit
betting
on
any
contingent
event
if
we
go
to
the
second
slide
we
collected
them
there
at
least
29
that
we
found
that
prohibit
staking
something
of
value
on
an
uncertain
event
or
contingency
and
of
course
that
defines
an
event
contract
it
would
mean
that
every
event
contract
falls
within
the
scope
of
roman
i
and
would
involve
unlawful
activity
and
that
just
ca
be
right
because
it
makes
the
other
five
enumerated
activities
superfluous
and
it
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
having
enumerated
activities
in
the
first
place
because
it
would
allow
the
commission
to
subject
every
event
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
so
every
kind
of
interpretation
tells
us
that
wrong
and
so
does
the
statutory
history
because
sort
of
notably
prior
to
2000
that
is
how
the
statute
worked
if
we
go
to
the
next
slide
we
have
that
language
they
actually
have
to
make
this
public
interest
determination
for
every
contract
that
was
repealed
in
2000
and
then
in
2010
congress
enacted
this
more
limit
provision
that
singles
out
the
categories
so
i
think
anything
that
covers
the
waterfront
is
necessarily
an
erroneous
interpretation
i
think
the
commission
actually
admits
that
they
say
on
page
11
of
their
final
reply
brief
that
sure
you
ca
read
any
of
these
to
cover
everything
that
would
not
be
tenable
and
so
they
try
to
explain
why
their
interpretation
does
do
that
and
just
to
be
candid
i
do
really
understand
what
they
trying
to
do
there
to
me
if
kalshi
contracts
involve
unlawful
activity
because
some
states
prohibit
betting
on
elections
then
all
event
contracts
involve
unlawful
activity
because
some
states
ban
betting
on
contingent
events
so
i
think
the
bottom
line
on
number
1
is
our
interpretation
is
the
only
one
that
sort
of
makes
sense
in
context
that
gives
this
provision
real
work
to
do
without
swallowing
everything
else
the
court
can
you
respond
and
apologies
if
it
in
your
reply
the
commission
gave
an
example
of
a
circumstance
in
which
they
would
say
a
contract
involved
war
without
the
underlying
event
actually
being
about
war
and
i
think
the
example
they
gave
is
whether
the
ukrainian
military
will
acquire
certain
munitions
in
2024
can
you
speak
to
that
example
they
saying
well
that
would
be
under
their
broader
reading
involve
something
that
relates
to
war
but
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
is
not
itself
an
act
of
war
mr
roth
that
may
have
been
our
example
i
not
sure
because
i
think
we
agree
with
that
it
may
have
been
theirs
the
court
maybe
it
was
your
example
sorry
mr
roth
i
not
sure
it
a
point
where
the
parties
disagree
i
think
it
goes
to
the
difference
between
involve
and
based
on
the
court
i
think
that
was
your
example
mr
roth
so
based
on
would
speak
literally
about
the
underlying
event
that
too
narrow
for
this
this
says
involve
so
there
this
broader
scope
our
point
is
that
the
broader
scope
is
tethered
around
the
event
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
you
still
looking
at
the
event
and
saying
does
the
event
relate
to
unlawful
activity
does
it
relate
to
war
does
it
relate
to
terrorism
so
you
can
sort
of
game
it
by
circumventing
by
sort
of
making
it
technically
something
that
just
a
proxy
it
would
capture
this
the
court
i
just
wanted
you
to
flesh
that
out
okay
mr
roth
okay
the
court
so
when
they
say
that
you
reading
or
using
the
word
involved
too
narrowly
you
would
dispute
that
you
not
disputing
that
involve
means
relate
to
all
those
other
dictionary
definitions
of
involve
it
just
relates
to
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
mr
roth
it
what
has
to
involve
we
do
actually
disagree
on
what
involve
means
we
disagree
on
what
has
to
involve
what
right
it
a
subtle
but
important
point
okay
that
takes
us
through
roman
unless
your
honor
has
further
questions
about
unlawful
activity
i
move
to
gaming
which
is
the
second
one
that
they
argue
again
the
fight
is
about
what
does
gaming
mean
in
this
statutory
context
our
core
point
is
really
simple
gaming
requires
a
game
so
if
there
no
underlying
game
there
no
gaming
and
so
for
example
if
you
have
a
contract
on
who
going
to
win
the
kentucky
derby
that
a
game
it
a
horse
race
it
a
game
if
you
have
an
event
contract
on
who
going
to
win
the
super
bowl
or
the
point
spread
in
the
super
bowl
it
involves
a
game
there
an
underlying
game
same
thing
with
the
lottery
they
have
an
underlying
game
that
forms
the
basis
for
the
contract
and
if
you
read
it
and
you
understand
it
that
way
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
benefits
to
that
number
one
going
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
earlier
it
lines
it
up
with
the
others
in
the
sense
that
there
is
this
connection
back
to
the
underlying
event
rather
than
just
talking
about
the
act
of
trading
in
isolation
number
two
i
think
is
most
consistent
with
the
text
the
root
word
of
gaming
is
game
i
think
it
aligns
with
the
legislative
history
the
famous
colloquy
that
gets
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefing
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
which
by
the
way
if
your
honor
wants
to
watch
it
on
c
span
you
wo
be
able
to
find
it
i
think
it
was
inserted
in
writing
after
the
fact
it
was
literally
a
colloquy
but
you
can
see
it
in
the
congressional
record
and
they
give
three
examples
of
gaming
contracts
football
horseracing
and
golf
they
all
games
i
do
think
that
an
accident
i
think
that
interpretation
makes
sense
too
because
what
is
a
game
it
something
that
has
no
inherent
economic
significance
it
something
that
is
done
for
amusement
it
may
be
done
for
sport
it
may
be
done
purely
to
facilitate
the
betting
itself
right
for
its
own
sake
so
i
think
it
makes
sense
for
congress
to
have
thought
about
that
category
contracts
that
involve
games
are
probably
not
the
type
of
contracts
that
we
want
to
be
listed
on
an
exchange
because
they
do
have
any
real
economic
value
to
them
but
again
what
tying
that
together
is
the
existence
of
the
game
because
the
game
is
the
thing
that
does
have
intrinsic
economic
significance
now
of
course
elections
are
not
games
they
not
done
for
amusement
they
not
done
for
sport
they
not
done
to
facilitate
betting
elections
matter
they
determine
our
government
they
determine
our
governance
nobody
would
really
call
them
games
so
in
our
view
a
contract
relating
to
an
election
is
not
gaming
the
court
i
have
never
before
this
case
considered
the
difference
between
gaming
and
gambling
but
i
love
to
hear
more
about
your
position
on
that
because
i
did
look
at
the
various
dictionary
definitions
just
to
understand
what
these
words
mean
that
i
have
used
many
times
and
there
are
some
definitions
that
you
would
say
cross
reference
and
they
say
define
as
gambling
so
i
understand
your
position
to
be
sure
gaming
is
part
of
gambling
but
gambling
is
not
gaming
or
gaming
is
a
subset
of
gambling
gambling
is
not
synonymous
with
gaming
mr
roth
i
do
think
that
the
better
understanding
of
the
way
the
terms
relate
i
think
gaming
has
this
more
close
tie
to
the
game
whereas
gambling
can
have
a
broader
meaning
i
will
say
when
i
went
through
the
dictionary
definitions
closely
what
i
found
was
i
think
this
is
important
even
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
gambling
there
generally
two
different
definitions
that
are
offered
in
the
dictionaries
there
a
narrower
one
and
there
a
broader
one
so
for
example
the
merriam
webster
the
first
definition
of
gamble
is
to
play
a
game
for
money
or
property
the
second
definition
is
to
stake
something
on
a
contingency
or
take
a
chance
okay
so
you
got
one
definition
that
is
tied
to
a
game
and
then
one
definition
that
is
not
tied
to
a
game
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
concise
oxford
english
dictionary
which
i
think
is
also
cited
in
the
briefs
two
definitions
of
gamble
number
one
play
games
of
chance
for
money
number
two
take
risky
action
in
the
hope
of
a
desired
result
i
think
that
sort
of
fair
there
are
two
different
ways
of
understanding
gambling
one
is
tied
to
the
existence
of
a
game
and
one
is
just
colloquially
sort
of
broader
right
a
betting
i
think
what
important
here
is
that
the
broader
definition
does
not
work
for
the
same
reasons
we
talked
about
earlier
if
you
sort
of
adopted
and
imported
the
broader
definition
of
gambling
and
treated
any
contract
that
involves
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
or
an
uncertain
outcome
then
you
covered
the
waterfront
of
event
contracts
and
so
that
ca
be
the
right
interpretation
of
gaming
in
the
statute
and
i
think
that
leaves
us
with
the
narrower
interpretation
in
the
dictionary
which
incorporates
the
concept
of
a
game
now
the
cftc
they
recognized
this
problem
with
the
broader
definition
and
actually
not
i
did
fully
understand
this
from
the
order
but
from
the
briefing
it
became
clear
they
sort
of
disclaiming
the
broader
definition
because
they
understand
that
that
does
work
in
context
and
so
instead
they
sort
of
offering
a
intermediate
approach
where
they
say
well
it
does
require
betting
on
a
game
or
a
contest
and
then
they
say
an
election
is
a
contest
so
voila
there
we
go
it
fits
in
the
brief
we
walk
through
each
step
of
that
logic
what
i
like
to
here
is
offer
a
few
higher
level
observations
on
that
argument
because
when
you
take
a
step
back
especially
i
think
it
just
too
clever
by
half
it
sort
of
this
lawyerly
attempt
to
parse
it
and
get
it
in
it
not
really
a
serious
attempt
at
statutory
interpretation
i
just
offer
a
few
reasons
for
that
number
1
if
congress
was
really
trying
to
get
at
election
contracts
the
easy
way
to
do
that
would
have
been
to
have
a
roman
vi
or
vii
that
said
elections
very
easy
one
word
to
say
that
they
were
trying
to
do
it
by
saying
gaming
which
some
definitions
cross
reference
gambling
which
you
could
say
involves
a
game
or
contest
it
the
most
attenuated
way
of
getting
at
this
so
strained
that
i
do
think
it
very
credible
second
point
is
there
no
support
for
this
in
the
legislative
history
the
colloquy
again
it
all
games
nothing
about
politics
third
if
you
look
at
where
they
getting
the
word
contest
from
it
really
instructive
because
they
pull
it
from
a
few
state
statutes
and
if
we
pull
up
we
got
the
text
of
a
couple
of
the
samples
of
those
but
it
very
clear
when
you
look
at
them
that
they
talking
about
contests
that
are
like
games
so
for
example
this
is
the
delaware
their
version
which
is
also
materially
identical
to
florida
and
they
talk
about
betting
or
wagering
on
the
result
of
any
trial
or
contests
wherever
conducted
of
skill
speed
or
power
of
endurance
or
human
or
beast
i
suppose
there
are
some
candidates
for
office
who
may
be
described
as
beasts
but
it
really
not
i
just
do
think
anyone
would
say
in
this
context
of
the
statute
contest
means
election
just
like
you
would
say
in
the
context
of
the
statute
that
trial
means
a
trial
in
this
courtroom
that
not
what
this
is
about
same
thing
if
you
look
at
the
next
this
is
the
louisiana
version
talks
about
conducting
as
a
business
any
game
contest
lottery
or
contrivance
when
you
put
game
and
lottery
next
to
contest
it
i
think
implies
a
certain
meaning
and
treating
that
as
including
elections
is
really
a
stretch
i
think
we
would
we
do
dispute
that
you
can
refer
to
an
election
as
a
contest
just
like
you
can
refer
to
a
corporate
board
fight
as
a
contest
you
could
refer
to
a
lawsuit
as
a
contest
but
in
the
context
of
these
gambling
statutes
that
not
what
they
are
talking
about
and
then
the
final
point
on
this
is
i
think
it
just
leads
to
some
really
arbitrary
results
because
if
you
focus
on
gaming
as
involving
a
game
then
there
a
certain
sense
to
it
right
as
i
said
earlier
like
games
do
have
any
external
economic
significance
generally
speaking
so
as
a
category
it
makes
sense
for
congress
the
carve
that
out
if
you
treat
it
as
games
plus
elections
it
very
strange
because
it
means
you
could
have
event
contracts
on
the
weather
on
whether
somebody
going
to
be
nominated
for
a
cabinet
role
on
what
color
dress
taylor
swift
is
going
to
wear
next
week
any
of
those
are
fine
but
elections
would
be
swept
up
by
the
gaming
category
it
just
weird
because
even
if
you
think
look
elections
are
different
and
should
be
treated
differently
and
i
know
my
colleague
is
going
to
try
to
explain
why
that
misguided
but
even
if
you
accepted
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
gaming
so
i
think
the
sort
of
takeaway
is
the
commission
is
latching
onto
this
word
as
sort
of
a
convenient
way
to
squeeze
its
desired
policy
outcome
into
the
statute
but
it
not
a
serious
attempt
to
really
understand
what
congress
meant
by
this
term
in
this
context
the
court
when
you
saying
and
i
would
agree
that
a
game
does
have
any
external
economic
significance
how
does
that
how
is
that
relevant
for
the
specific
argument
you
making
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
that
mr
roth
what
i
mean
is
if
we
trying
to
think
of
what
was
congress
trying
to
get
at
with
gaming
the
court
okay
mr
roth
if
we
understand
gaming
to
mean
a
contract
that
involves
an
underlying
game
then
there
a
certain
policy
sense
to
treating
that
category
differently
because
congress
could
have
been
thinking
about
it
and
saying
well
there
is
some
of
this
in
the
legislative
history
the
colloquy
if
you
look
at
it
well
games
do
matter
in
the
real
word
they
games
so
we
do
want
people
essentially
gambling
right
on
something
that
does
matter
in
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
so
it
gives
some
sense
to
the
categorization
that
congress
laid
out
and
the
problem
i
have
with
the
alternative
interpretations
is
they
do
have
that
sort
of
unifying
policy
rationale
behind
them
right
again
the
really
broad
version
sweeps
up
everything
that
does
work
and
then
games
plus
elections
what
is
tying
those
things
together
it
not
it
does
seem
to
me
a
line
that
you
could
really
seriously
draw
from
this
word
so
that
what
i
trying
to
get
at
the
court
okay
mr
roth
okay
so
that
takes
care
of
roman
v
and
so
our
position
is
that
is
then
the
end
of
the
analysis
and
there
no
need
to
go
any
further
but
i
will
turn
it
over
to
my
colleague
if
your
honor
has
no
further
questions
on
this
piece
to
address
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
issue
the
court
there
are
a
lot
of
references
by
the
commission
about
kind
of
representations
on
your
client
website
about
what
it
does
do
you
want
to
respond
to
that
mr
roth
i
think
it
a
page
that
just
pulls
press
articles
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
it
just
like
a
collection
of
links
to
articles
that
have
mentioned
kalshi
it
not
like
a
representation
by
the
client
about
what
the
court
what
its
business
is
mr
roth
it
like
here
people
are
talking
about
us
here
a
list
of
stories
the
court
okay
mr
roth
thank
you
your
honor
ms
rice
good
morning
your
honor
my
name
is
amanda
rice
and
i
here
to
talk
briefly
about
the
commission
public
interest
analysis
as
my
colleague
explained
we
think
the
statutory
issue
is
dispositive
so
you
do
have
to
go
this
far
so
i
try
to
keep
it
pretty
quick
but
even
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
the
statutory
argument
they
are
still
required
here
because
the
agency
public
policy
analysis
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
i
start
with
just
a
brief
note
on
the
standard
of
review
there
was
some
back
and
forth
on
this
issue
in
the
brief
but
as
i
think
the
commission
acknowledges
in
the
end
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
applies
to
all
final
agency
actions
regardless
of
their
form
that
a
deferential
standard
for
sure
but
it
has
some
real
teeth
it
means
agencies
have
to
engage
in
reasoned
decision
making
and
agency
actions
are
arbitrary
and
capricious
if
they
apply
the
wrong
standard
or
ignore
relevant
considerations
or
they
do
explain
themselves
reasonably
those
are
the
kinds
of
arguments
we
making
here
and
they
go
to
both
sides
of
the
public
interest
analysis
the
sort
of
benefits
on
the
one
hand
and
the
alleged
harms
on
the
other
so
i
take
those
two
points
in
turn
starting
with
the
benefits
court
reporter
clarification
ms
rice
i
was
trying
to
be
quick
but
do
want
to
speak
too
quick
the
court
take
your
time
ms
rice
so
the
economic
benefits
all
follow
i
think
from
one
simple
proposition
which
is
that
partisan
control
of
congress
has
economic
implications
i
think
that
pretty
commonsensical
but
there
a
ton
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
point
i
just
got
a
couple
of
points
highlighted
on
the
slides
here
the
first
one
is
from
harvard
professor
jason
furman
who
a
former
chairman
of
president
obama
council
of
economic
advisors
he
explains
that
congressional
control
impacts
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
ways
that
have
direct
economic
consequences
to
businesses
and
workers
he
says
this
risk
is
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
risks
that
can
be
managed
using
financial
markets
on
the
next
slide
we
got
managing
director
of
jpmorgan
so
coming
from
a
different
perspective
who
explains
that
election
risk
is
one
of
the
largest
risks
that
their
clients
face
that
the
frequently
engage
proactively
on
how
to
minimize
it
or
to
hedge
it
hedging
is
a
word
as
i
understand
it
for
minimizing
risk
lisboa
gives
the
example
of
specifically
the
coal
industry
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
examples
in
the
record
that
stand
out
on
different
sides
so
there
a
software
company
serving
green
energy
businesses
it
at
page
1597
of
the
record
there
a
recycling
robotics
firm
that
at
1533
of
the
record
these
are
just
sort
of
common
sense
examples
of
businesses
that
have
direct
control
of
partisan
control
of
congress
and
then
take
it
from
sam
altman
who
the
ceo
of
openai
he
explains
here
the
different
risks
that
biotech
companies
face
those
are
direct
and
they
predictable
he
explains
they
involve
everything
from
the
fda
and
different
approvals
to
research
funding
and
legislation
so
it
not
just
legislation
there
all
kinds
of
other
things
that
congress
is
doing
here
because
these
risks
are
so
significant
financial
institutions
already
offer
projections
on
the
economic
impacts
of
elections
and
there
instruments
for
hedging
against
those
risks
you
already
seen
it
from
jpmorgan
there
more
examples
of
that
on
pages
42
to
44
of
the
record
if
that
helpful
and
then
there
are
the
noneconomic
benefits
researchers
policymakers
the
public
everyone
benefits
from
market
based
data
about
elections
these
markets
already
exist
i
know
your
honor
is
familiar
with
in
nonprofit
forms
because
this
information
is
so
valuable
so
these
are
just
a
few
examples
from
the
record
but
that
really
just
tip
of
the
iceberg
i
thought
pages
40
and
41
of
our
opening
brief
and
68
to
70
of
the
record
really
tell
this
story
of
the
noneconomic
benefits
so
the
agency
does
have
much
to
say
about
either
of
those
two
points
so
they
respond
mostly
by
trying
to
move
the
goal
post
they
make
what
i
understand
to
be
two
primary
arguments
the
first
one
is
about
direct
effects
they
say
that
the
economic
effects
of
elections
sure
that
they
exist
but
they
not
direct
enough
i
think
your
honor
is
using
the
language
of
too
many
intervening
events
to
make
a
difference
we
explained
in
our
brief
that
the
record
says
otherwise
you
already
seen
some
examples
today
i
think
more
important
and
more
fundamental
is
the
idea
that
the
whole
point
of
having
hedging
with
event
contracts
is
to
account
for
diffused
risks
this
is
not
a
one
to
one
kind
of
hedging
product
like
the
way
insurance
works
if
there
a
hurricane
for
example
that
example
helps
me
because
you
can
see
both
the
direct
and
indirect
effects
of
a
hurricane
right
it
might
destroy
property
but
it
does
other
stuff
too
it
deters
tourists
you
ca
always
predict
exactly
what
those
effects
might
be
but
it
a
feature
not
a
bug
of
these
contracts
they
allow
you
to
capture
anything
that
might
follow
from
an
event
like
this
the
court
if
i
can
just
stop
you
right
there
so
what
i
understood
the
argument
on
the
other
side
to
be
is
certainly
if
a
hurricane
hit
the
extent
of
the
damage
or
effect
on
tourism
or
property
that
might
not
be
able
to
be
predicted
in
advance
so
whatever
your
worst
fear
might
not
materialize
but
whatever
effect
there
is
will
be
direct
meaning
to
the
extent
that
there
is
property
damage
you
can
trace
that
directly
to
the
hurricane
so
maybe
the
result
does
materialize
in
the
way
that
it
was
predicted
but
there
is
a
direct
effect
and
my
understanding
is
that
at
least
they
would
argue
with
elections
particularly
in
this
context
where
we
talking
about
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
by
a
party
that
sure
whatever
thought
about
what
might
happen
may
not
materialize
but
to
the
extent
there
is
an
effect
you
may
not
be
able
to
trace
it
directly
to
who
controls
a
party
at
a
given
time
or
a
chamber
of
congress
at
a
different
time
because
there
are
so
many
variables
who
in
office
as
president
kind
of
what
the
split
is
if
it
a
more
even
split
kind
of
what
the
priorities
are
of
congress
despite
control
legislation
does
always
get
passed
or
become
a
priority
so
what
would
you
respond
to
their
point
about
this
not
being
the
kind
of
direct
economic
effect
that
some
of
the
other
trading
contracts
have
ms
rice
i
think
you
right
about
what
their
argument
is
but
i
think
both
pieces
of
it
are
wrong
and
starting
with
the
hurricane
example
i
think
hurricanes
do
have
very
similar
indirect
effects
so
you
talking
about
property
damage
but
that
not
it
there
might
also
be
decreases
in
tourism
that
might
also
have
to
do
with
other
features
of
the
weather
did
an
amusement
park
get
built
nearby
things
like
that
might
also
affect
tourism
it
not
going
to
be
one
to
one
there
actually
a
pretty
helpful
chart
on
pages
53
to
55
of
the
record
that
identifies
some
other
event
contracts
and
tries
to
explain
exactly
that
point
here
are
the
ways
in
which
the
economic
impacts
are
not
direct
they
indirect
and
that
true
of
temperature
fluctuations
so
is
it
going
to
be
hot
in
california
this
month
that
might
have
some
direct
effects
and
then
some
indirect
effects
that
the
first
piece
of
it
the
way
other
contracts
work
the
way
congress
works
there
also
a
lot
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
are
direct
effects
here
that
just
the
election
a
change
of
control
in
congress
affects
stock
prices
immediately
affects
the
valuations
of
entities
immediately
without
any
legislation
passing
that
legislation
passing
is
of
course
a
piece
of
this
but
these
economic
impacts
happen
even
if
no
legislation
passes
so
i
thought
the
discussion
at
40
to
46
of
the
record
is
pretty
helpful
on
that
it
has
some
examples
i
point
to
1397
which
shows
that
the
green
energy
sector
surged
as
a
result
of
the
democratic
party
senate
takeover
again
before
anything
happened
it
just
control
of
congress
that
has
these
direct
effects
so
to
circle
back
to
your
question
i
think
direct
effects
is
a
strange
question
to
be
asking
for
these
contracts
but
not
others
when
all
event
contracts
have
these
sort
of
indirect
economic
effects
but
even
if
that
were
the
question
i
think
it
pretty
clear
that
there
are
direct
effects
here
if
that
answers
your
question
the
court
maybe
you
about
to
get
to
this
i
do
want
to
distract
you
from
your
presentation
but
can
you
speak
to
the
manipulation
and
integrity
piece
because
i
do
think
and
obviously
i
going
to
look
very
closely
at
the
statute
and
follow
what
it
says
but
i
do
think
there
is
kind
of
a
just
to
be
honest
a
gut
reaction
that
people
might
have
that
wow
betting
on
elections
does
seem
like
a
good
idea
it
seems
like
there
a
lot
of
room
for
manipulation
for
kind
of
unsavory
things
happening
can
you
speak
to
that
directly
and
what
your
position
is
as
it
relates
to
the
public
interest
concern
because
i
understand
a
significant
part
of
the
commission
view
that
this
is
against
public
interest
has
to
do
with
some
of
those
concerns
ms
rice
absolutely
i
skip
right
there
i
think
you
right
that
that
what
the
commission
said
that
it
sort
of
feels
icky
or
that
there
a
risk
of
election
manipulation
in
some
form
and
i
think
starting
with
the
risk
of
manipulation
which
i
think
is
the
more
serious
public
interest
analysis
the
icky
feeling
i
think
is
misguided
but
i
think
it
stems
from
the
misunderstanding
that
these
contracts
could
influence
elections
in
some
way
or
people
will
be
buying
votes
or
things
like
that
so
i
guess
i
start
by
pointing
out
that
political
event
markets
have
existed
forever
in
unregulated
forms
but
also
in
other
democracies
and
i
do
think
there
a
feeling
in
those
places
that
somehow
the
existence
of
these
markets
affects
the
integrity
of
elections
then
there
good
research
in
the
records
showing
that
this
kind
of
manipulation
is
not
remotely
plausible
i
found
the
comment
from
the
center
for
effective
altruism
particularly
helpful
at
this
point
that
at
pages
1427
to
1436
of
the
record
kind
of
take
each
aspect
of
the
election
manipulation
arguments
and
unpack
them
one
at
a
time
and
explain
why
they
wrong
at
that
time
most
basic
level
i
think
the
key
point
is
that
people
try
to
influence
elections
because
they
matter
they
matter
for
our
lives
they
matter
for
their
economic
effects
but
for
lots
of
other
reasons
and
so
there
lots
of
money
and
effort
spent
on
influencing
elections
that
what
campaign
finance
fights
are
all
about
and
there
a
way
in
which
you
might
think
that
some
of
that
icky
or
you
have
the
same
reaction
that
spending
money
to
try
to
get
elections
is
icky
but
i
think
it
important
here
to
point
out
how
much
money
and
how
many
incentives
there
are
in
these
elections
because
it
makes
manipulation
seem
pretty
darn
unlikely
particularly
as
your
honor
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
that
this
is
a
contract
about
control
of
congress
i
think
this
is
another
place
where
that
point
is
relevant
so
it
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
statutory
analysis
but
on
the
public
interest
piece
if
you
asking
what
the
public
interest
here
we
looking
at
this
specific
contract
and
asking
whether
there
a
serious
public
interest
harm
on
the
other
side
if
there
some
possibility
that
having
a
regulated
event
contract
market
as
opposed
to
the
unregulated
ones
that
already
exist
could
result
in
manipulation
of
control
of
congress
it
just
pretty
hard
to
imagine
i
think
if
there
were
a
way
to
manipulate
control
of
congress
someone
would
have
tried
it
hard
to
imagine
that
the
event
contract
market
could
change
all
of
the
profound
incentives
that
already
exist
it
sort
of
circles
back
to
the
initial
point
that
elections
matter
they
have
real
life
consequences
and
that
why
people
try
to
impact
elections
i
think
the
record
is
pretty
clear
that
the
possibility
of
manipulation
is
just
pure
speculation
that
there
not
evidence
supporting
that
sort
of
intuition
that
you
came
up
with
at
the
beginning
that
there
something
that
feels
a
little
bit
strange
about
that
one
last
point
i
think
the
commission
suggested
too
it
would
have
to
police
elections
if
it
approved
these
contracts
my
response
to
that
is
just
the
agency
regulates
contracts
that
have
underlying
events
of
all
kinds
so
an
event
contract
on
power
plant
emissions
does
mean
the
cftc
has
to
become
the
epa
all
of
a
sudden
and
regulate
power
plant
emissions
in
the
same
way
that
an
event
contract
that
has
to
do
with
stock
prices
does
turn
it
into
the
scc
all
the
agency
does
is
the
same
thing
it
does
in
any
other
context
it
just
regulates
the
market
not
the
underlying
activity
so
insomuch
as
that
the
other
aspect
of
this
that
there
a
concern
about
manipulation
and
there
a
concern
about
the
agency
and
what
it
would
have
to
do
as
a
result
i
think
there
no
real
reason
to
worry
that
its
role
would
be
any
different
here
than
it
is
in
any
other
context
the
court
do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
what
your
colleague
was
saying
when
i
asked
the
question
about
the
particular
safeguards
that
your
client
has
put
into
place
and
obviously
deemed
important
for
example
the
one
that
sticks
out
is
well
if
you
a
paid
member
of
a
congressional
staff
then
you
obviously
can
not
trade
these
contracts
and
there
are
other
safeguards
that
were
put
into
place
but
as
i
understand
your
position
the
commission
would
reach
that
because
it
not
enumerated
in
the
statute
so
there
would
be
no
public
interest
inquiry
and
so
those
kind
of
conditions
or
safeguards
would
not
be
required
nor
is
the
fact
that
this
is
an
election
contract
involving
control
of
the
house
particularly
relevant
a
dcm
could
have
this
event
contract
for
the
upcoming
presidential
election
right
so
those
things
that
you
point
to
as
evidence
of
well
there
are
safeguards
in
place
and
this
is
about
control
of
congress
that
not
really
relevant
to
the
statutory
question
correct
ms
rice
you
right
that
it
not
part
of
the
statutory
question
it
is
relevant
to
the
public
interest
analysis
if
you
get
that
far
if
you
assume
that
we
lose
on
the
statutory
analysis
which
we
do
think
is
the
right
answer
here
but
if
you
get
to
public
interest
so
this
is
a
gaming
contract
or
unlawful
activity
contract
then
you
looking
at
the
public
interest
and
it
is
relevant
the
kinds
of
safeguards
we
have
in
place
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
contract
involving
the
court
i
guess
that
my
point
if
under
your
reading
you
would
get
to
the
public
interest
so
that
my
point
the
commission
would
have
no
ability
or
interest
in
considering
the
fact
that
a
contract
did
have
such
a
safeguard
mr
roth
i
did
want
to
cut
you
off
but
i
had
to
ask
my
colleague
who
actually
knows
the
statutory
framework
better
the
court
okay
mr
roth
what
he
clarified
for
me
was
that
there
are
separate
antifraud
provisions
anti
manipulation
provisions
and
what
they
call
the
core
principles
that
you
have
to
comply
with
and
so
that
where
some
of
these
other
safeguards
come
from
it
just
not
from
this
particular
statute
sorry
i
did
mean
to
rice
no
no
no
the
court
let
me
just
make
sure
i
understand
you
saying
it
not
implicated
by
this
statutory
provision
that
at
issue
in
the
lawsuit
but
as
part
of
this
scheme
generally
there
other
safeguards
and
these
are
statutory
from
the
commission
meaning
that
you
have
to
comply
with
these
provisions
mr
roth
right
that
right
the
court
okay
ms
rice
that
all
consistent
with
my
understanding
and
there
some
stuff
in
the
record
on
this
too
pages
80
to
88
of
the
ja
and
99
to
100
we
talk
about
the
core
principles
and
the
kind
of
background
rules
in
place
just
to
be
a
regulated
market
that
this
cftc
regulates
you
have
to
have
these
protections
you
listed
out
the
specific
people
that
are
allowed
to
trade
and
all
of
that
is
exactly
right
but
there
is
separately
and
for
all
contracts
a
prohibition
on
any
insider
with
any
non
public
information
trading
on
these
contracts
so
that
in
addition
to
the
specifically
enumerated
categories
the
court
that
makes
sense
and
that
applies
to
any
of
these
event
contracts
ms
rice
exactly
to
everything
so
where
there
is
insider
trading
or
manipulation
the
agency
has
the
tools
to
go
out
and
investigate
those
things
they
just
not
relevant
to
the
statutory
analysis
in
the
first
instance
if
that
makes
sense
unless
you
have
anything
further
your
honor
i
just
wrap
up
by
reiterating
that
i
do
think
you
need
to
get
to
public
interest
but
if
you
do
you
still
should
vacate
the
order
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
court
i
do
have
another
question
i
do
know
whose
so
i
will
let
whoever
answer
this
there
is
something
in
the
commission
brief
that
i
thought
was
it
this
point
unlike
many
hedging
and
risk
management
contracts
the
payout
on
the
contract
at
issue
here
is
not
in
any
way
tied
to
actual
or
estimated
losses
incurred
elsewhere
and
a
loss
on
the
contracts
is
not
offset
by
a
gain
elsewhere
i
just
thought
that
was
interesting
and
wanted
your
response
to
that
ms
rice
i
do
think
that
as
unusual
as
the
commission
makes
out
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
immediately
is
the
temperature
related
contracts
i
think
that
works
in
the
same
way
that
that
not
a
gain
or
a
loss
necessarily
it
not
clear
even
which
way
that
cuts
there
may
well
be
other
examples
but
my
immediate
reaction
to
that
is
i
do
think
that
particularly
unusual
in
this
context
the
court
i
learning
more
about
this
market
through
this
case
but
this
whole
futures
market
it
seems
to
me
it
grown
beyond
the
days
in
which
only
those
who
are
interested
in
the
commodity
or
directly
affected
are
participating
i
mean
that
the
case
for
all
these
contracts
right
ms
rice
that
true
of
all
the
contracts
in
fact
instruments
to
make
money
is
actually
necessary
for
the
markets
i
think
as
the
commission
order
i
think
acknowledges
some
amount
of
speculation
or
people
who
are
investing
in
these
to
be
liquid
because
if
it
was
just
hedgers
if
it
was
100
percent
hedgers
you
do
actually
get
someone
willing
to
balance
out
the
price
and
sell
you
or
buy
from
you
at
the
other
side
so
there
are
people
in
all
of
these
market
who
do
have
a
direct
hedging
interest
but
the
hedging
piece
of
it
is
certainly
meaningful
and
potentially
more
meaningful
in
this
context
than
many
of
the
others
the
court
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say
about
their
economic
purpose
test
i
trying
to
see
what
the
daylight
between
the
two
parties
is
with
respect
to
that
test
and
how
it
applied
ms
rice
so
i
think
we
agree
that
the
commission
has
discretion
to
consider
the
economic
impacts
of
these
contracts
that
this
statue
and
these
instruments
are
about
economic
benefits
i
think
where
we
diverge
is
the
commissions
focus
on
sort
of
two
things
one
is
direct
effects
as
opposed
to
indirect
effect
we
talked
about
and
the
other
is
this
predominately
hedging
or
more
than
occasional
hedging
the
court
that
what
i
meant
ms
rice
the
language
shifts
in
the
order
and
i
think
the
difference
probably
matters
occasional
sounds
to
me
like
something
less
than
predominant
i
not
entirely
clear
which
one
the
commission
is
advocating
for
so
i
think
part
of
the
problem
with
that
standard
is
that
it
not
clear
what
it
means
whether
it
means
a
certain
number
of
uses
how
many
dollars
are
going
to
be
spent
in
a
hedging
way
is
it
a
proportion
of
uses
is
it
some
combination
of
the
two
and
how
much
is
occasional
i
do
know
that
you
need
to
get
into
that
your
honor
because
i
think
by
any
metric
the
record
shows
there
will
be
more
than
occasional
uses
here
but
i
think
those
are
the
two
points
on
which
we
really
disagree
not
on
whether
economic
benefits
are
relevant
the
court
the
same
question
i
do
really
understand
there
to
be
a
dispute
about
my
standard
of
review
here
and
what
the
applicable
review
framework
is
ms
rice
i
agree
with
that
your
honor
there
was
some
back
and
forth
about
rule
making
cases
versus
adjudication
cases
ultimately
the
standard
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
both
there
are
more
rule
making
cases
and
this
proceeding
is
a
bit
unusual
in
that
there
were
formal
comments
accepted
and
considered
which
does
turn
it
into
a
formal
rule
making
that
never
been
our
argument
but
it
looks
a
little
bit
more
formal
than
informal
adjudication
does
but
you
right
that
the
standard
is
the
same
the
court
all
right
thank
you

good

thank
you
any
time
you
want
me
to
jump
to
an
issue
please
just
let
me
know
the
court
could
i
just
ask
you
something
i
curious
about
to
start
ms
stukes
absolutely
sure
the
court
with
respect
to
this
catchall
category
the
commission
specifically
did
make
an
argument
that
this
contract
falls
within
the
catchall
and
i
was
just
curious
as
to
i
not
saying
it
does
i
just
curious
as
to
why
that
was
the
position
of
the
commission
ms
stukes
in
considering
the
case
that
was
before
it
the
commission
examined
these
contracts
and
determined
that
two
categories
applied
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
statute
and
therefore
did
reach
any
further
categories
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
so
as
the
court
is
aware
the
cftc
order
that
at
issue
in
this
case
determined
under
cea
section
5cc5c
i
call
it
5cc5c
i
talking
about
the
same
statutory
language
that
codified
at
7
78
2
the
cea
is
like
many
statutes
sort
of
odd
where
sometimes
our
statutory
sections
do
line
up
with
the
codification
in
any
event
the
order
at
issue
here
determined
under
cea
5cc5c
that
kalshi
proposed
congressional
control
contracts
should
not
be
offered
on
kalshi
platform
because
the
commission
determined
that
those
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
commission
decision
was
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
commission
decision
addressed
four
principle
issues
that
the
parties
have
briefed
and
i
will
discuss
today
first
how
does
the
word
involve
apply
to
activities
enumerated
in
the
statute
second
do
these
proposed
contracts
involve
the
enumerated
activity
of
gaming
third
do
the
contracts
involve
the
enumerated
activity
of
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
and
four
are
the
contracts
contrary
to
public
interest
before
i
get
into
the
substance
of
each
of
these
issues
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
commission
order
is
an
informal
adjudication
and
your
honor
just
asked
about
the
standard
of
review
this
is
not
a
rule
making
and
it
not
even
a
formal
adjudication
and
that
means
in
practical
terms
that
the
commission
was
deciding
just
one
issue
whether
these
particular
proposed
contracts
should
be
listed
on
kalshi
event
contracts
platform
and
the
commission
did
purport
to
address
any
other
question
larger
than
that
so
for
instance
the
order
does
establish
the
full
metes
and
bounds
of
how
the
statute
might
apply
to
any
other
event
contract
other
than
the
ones
that
were
before
it
the
court
and
just
for
my
own
information
is
it
typical
for
the
commission
to
solicit
comment
in
a
circumstance
like
this
ms
stukes
it
not
required
it
did
so
i
think
in
an
abundance
of
caution
the
court
is
that
an
unusual
event
or
not
unusual
ms
stukes
i
do
want
to
say
something
misleading
especially
without
talking
to
my
colleagues
about
how
frequently
have
we
done
this
i
wish
i
had
a
better
answer
for
your
honor
the
court
it
more
out
of
my
curiosity
ms
stukes
i
can
see
why
i
think
the
commission
did
it
really
in
an
abundance
of
caution
because
of
public
interest
associated
with
this
topic
generally
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
i
emphasizing
that
this
is
an
informal
adjudication
because
when
your
honor
considers
the
question
before
you
which
is
rather
the
commission
ran
afoul
of
what
required
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
the
standard
of
review
is
a
lenient
one
the
law
requires
only
that
the
agency
acted
within
a
zone
of
reasonableness
here
the
cftc
reasonably
considered
the
relevant
issues
and
reasonably
explained
its
position
and
no
more
was
required
under
the
apa
the
apa
gives
the
agency
deference
on
its
predictive
judgments
and
on
its
public
interest
determination
now
there
are
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
in
this
case
and
your
honor
finds
herself
maybe
in
the
unenviable
position
of
having
each
party
in
this
case
tell
you
the
statute
is
unambiguous
that
the
plain
meaning
advocated
by
each
side
supports
each
side
i
submit
that
the
commission
has
the
better
of
the
argument
on
what
the
statute
means
and
how
it
applies
on
involve
gaming
and
unlawful
under
state
law
that
the
court
review
on
the
statutory
interpretation
questions
is
de
novo
i
get
into
now
the
first
of
the
four
issues
that
are
before
the
court
that
are
briefed
in
the
party
papers
and
that
is
the
commission
reading
of
the
word
involve
to
have
its
ordinary
meaning
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
as
an
essential
feature
a
consequence
these
are
the
ordinary
dictionary
definitions
of
the
term
and
that
is
the
definition
that
applies
because
the
term
involved
is
the
the
term
involve
is
not
defined
in
the
statute
and
so
case
law
has
held
for
a
long
time
that
when
there
when
the
statute
does
define
the
term
its
ordinary
meaning
applies
and
that
means
the
ordinary
meaning
in
dictionaries
so
what
that
means
for
the
statute
here
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
involve
when
we
talking
about
the
categories
enumerated
in
the
statute
that
would
render
an
event
contract
eligible
for
public
interest
review
the
word
involve
is
broad
enough
by
its
plain
meaning
to
cover
event
contracts
whose
underlying
meaning
the
event
on
which
the
contract
is
premised
here
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
contracts
where
whose
underlying
involved
the
enumerated
activity
as
well
as
contracts
that
relate
closely
entail
or
have
as
their
essentially
feature
or
consequence
the
enumerated
activity
the
court
i
do
understand
the
plaintiff
to
necessarily
disagree
with
the
definition
that
you
set
forward
but
i
think
when
you
say
that
closely
relates
to
or
entails
they
saying
yes
to
the
subject
matter
or
underlying
activity
of
the
contract
so
can
you
just
speak
to
that
because
i
had
thought
initially
that
there
was
some
difference
with
how
you
were
defining
involve
and
now
having
heard
from
plaintiff
and
going
back
and
reading
their
brief
reviewing
those
portions
of
the
brief
i
now
see
more
clearly
what
they
were
saying
that
those
definitions
have
to
relate
to
the
activity
at
issue
underlying
the
contract
so
if
you
could
just
speak
directly
to
that
ms
stukes
that
is
generally
my
understanding
of
the
dispute
between
the
parties
here
and
that
is
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff
and
not
to
mischaracterize
but
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff
position
they
saying
involve
if
it
means
anything
it
has
to
mean
that
the
underlying
event
involves
an
enumerated
activity
and
it
ca
be
a
broader
relationship
involving
the
contract
itself
so
when
we
look
at
the
statutory
language
and
whether
a
contract
is
in
the
scope
of
the
pardon
me
of
the
statute
at
all
it
a
two
step
inquiry
so
the
first
step
in
the
statutory
language
is
does
the
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
an
excluded
commodity
that
is
based
upon
based
upon
that
means
the
underlying
based
upon
the
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
so
step
one
in
other
words
asks
is
the
contract
based
on
does
it
is
it
based
on
is
the
underlying
an
event
because
this
pardon
me
this
statute
applies
only
to
event
contracts
so
step
one
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
which
uses
based
upon
meaning
underlying
in
the
same
sentence
that
it
uses
involve
step
one
is
is
this
an
event
contract
at
all
is
the
underlying
an
event
if
so
we
in
the
statute
at
least
this
far
step
two
is
whether
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
the
enumerated
activity
and
that
a
broader
question
than
whether
just
the
underlying
event
involves
the
enumerated
activities
based
on
as
used
in
the
statute
unambiguously
refers
to
the
underlying
event
it
must
be
an
event
that
all
involve
is
broader
any
aspect
of
the
contract
transaction
or
agreement
if
it
involves
an
enumerated
activity
we
submit
that
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
involve
it
in
the
statute
at
least
it
gets
you
so
far
as
to
be
eligible
that
the
relationship
between
the
contract
and
the
enumerated
activities
if
the
contract
transaction
or
agreement
involves
the
enumerated
activity
we
in
the
statute
underlying
what
the
contract
is
based
upon
what
the
actual
event
is
can
be
can
the
underlying
can
involve
the
enumerated
activities
they
fairly
easy
to
think
of
examples
if
the
event
contract
is
based
upon
whether
a
war
will
break
out
it
in
an
enumerated
activity
the
court
is
there
an
example
of
a
contract
that
under
this
broader
definition
that
you
advocating
for
would
involve
war
where
the
underlying
activity
in
the
contract
does
speak
to
war
itself
ms
stukes
the
examples
are
the
examples
of
how
a
contract
could
involve
war
but
not
involve
an
act
of
war
have
to
do
and
i
think
both
parties
cite
this
kind
of
example
will
i
hate
to
give
these
real
world
examples
will
a
foreign
body
be
able
to
use
weapons
on
its
enemy
soil
something
like
that
that
involves
oh
gosh
i
do
want
to
get
too
in
the
weeds
will
funding
be
allocated
to
a
country
that
at
war
that
involves
war
the
court
i
think
they
would
say
yes
ms
stukes
i
actually
do
think
we
too
off
base
on
that
i
think
the
real
dispute
between
the
parties
is
what
are
you
looking
at
what
has
to
involve
the
enumerated
activities
and
the
real
rub
here
is
that
the
commission
interprets
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
to
say
if
transacting
in
the
contracts
if
the
feature
or
purpose
of
these
contracts
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
gambling
is
the
one
gaming
pardon
me
is
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
transacting
in
the
contract
is
that
essential
feature
gaming
and
the
commission
here
said
yes
for
gaming
and
for
unlawful
under
state
law
the
court
so
what
is
your
best
argument
for
their
response
that
there
are
a
lot
of
states
and
they
listed
them
for
me
that
make
any
type
of
betting
stakes
on
any
contingent
event
unlawful
under
state
law
such
that
that
what
these
event
contracts
are
so
every
event
contract
should
theoretically
if
the
transaction
of
the
contract
in
and
of
itself
is
what
involve
means
and
not
the
underlying
activity
at
issue
in
the
contract
than
just
the
mere
transacting
event
contracts
would
violate
state
law
how
do
you
respond
to
that
ms
stukes
i
want
to
say
two
things
about
that
and
i
can
jump
to
the
discussion
of
how
we
analyzed
unlawful
under
state
law
the
commission
is
not
saying
that
involve
in
every
instance
means
anything
other
than
its
plain
meaning
let
me
say
that
in
a
little
more
with
a
little
better
articulation
involve
is
a
broad
term
it
broad
enough
to
cover
event
contracts
whose
underlying
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
it
broad
enough
to
cover
an
event
contract
whose
essential
feature
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
here
an
essential
feature
of
these
contracts
is
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
the
court
but
an
essential
feature
of
some
other
contract
could
be
betting
or
wagering
on
fill
in
the
blank
ms
stukes
right
so
your
honor
concern
i
think
is
the
plaintiff
argument
what
do
we
do
with
this
what
i
interpret
as
an
extrapolation
from
what
the
commission
actually
said
to
say
well
that
would
be
absurd
in
another
context
because
other
state
laws
say
it
unlawful
there
are
state
laws
that
say
it
unlawful
to
wager
on
any
contingent
event
and
that
would
sweep
in
every
event
contract
to
a
public
interest
review
the
court
right
ms
stukes
so
i
just
getting
to
my
notes
where
i
have
this
the
court
sure
take
your
time
ms
stukes
the
commission
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
these
contracts
which
involve
wagering
on
elections
involve
activity
under
state
law
here
we
have
numerous
state
laws
that
forbid
wagering
on
elections
and
that
was
sufficient
for
the
commission
to
say
state
law
forbids
wagering
on
elections
that
the
essential
feature
of
these
contracts
and
we
can
stop
there
what
the
commission
did
do
is
say
state
law
forbids
or
makes
unlawful
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
commission
reasoning
and
even
if
you
can
say
if
a
is
to
b
then
c
is
to
d
like
some
logical
extrapolation
that
not
what
the
commission
did
here
it
just
said
we
see
under
state
law
that
wagering
on
elections
is
unlawful
and
that
the
essential
feature
of
these
contracts
and
that
enough
that
enough
that
we
in
the
zone
of
the
statute
the
court
right
but
ms
stukes
and
it
not
unreasonable
i
sorry
i
interrupted
your
honor
the
court
i
just
wanted
to
because
right
now
i
think
we
talking
about
what
the
meaning
of
the
terms
in
the
statute
are
and
their
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
commission
reading
does
make
sense
this
is
otherwise
unambiguous
and
they
applying
this
word
in
a
way
that
kind
of
means
one
thing
in
one
subsection
and
another
in
another
subsection
and
what
they
saying
is
elections
is
not
on
this
enumerated
list
and
that
full
stop
end
of
case
and
you
saying
well
no
it
fits
under
the
first
category
because
betting
on
or
wagering
on
elections
violates
many
state
laws
and
their
response
is
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
violates
many
state
laws
and
if
that
were
the
reading
if
that
how
the
statute
was
read
that
would
mean
that
every
event
contract
would
be
subject
to
this
two
step
review
which
was
not
the
intent
when
the
statute
was
amended
to
streamline
this
process
and
not
make
the
dcm
have
to
make
an
initial
showing
that
the
contract
was
in
the
public
interest
so
i
just
speaking
more
about
the
unlawful
under
state
law
what
does
that
mean
does
that
mean
that
the
act
of
trading
the
contract
is
unlawful
under
state
law
in
which
case
that
would
might
relate
to
many
contracts
or
all
event
contracts
or
does
the
underlying
activity
for
example
i
think
plaintiff
gave
an
example
whether
or
not
some
crime
was
going
to
occur
whatever
it
is
some
specific
criminal
activity
where
the
subject
of
the
contract
relates
to
involves
something
that
is
unlawful
so
i
just
want
to
understand
the
difference
your
response
to
that
that
your
reading
would
put
every
event
contract
under
this
inquiry
ms
stukes
respectfully
i
do
believe
that
what
the
commission
held
in
this
order
would
subject
every
event
contract
because
what
the
commission
said
is
only
that
examining
these
contracts
whose
essential
feature
is
to
bet
on
elections
that
involves
activity
that
many
state
laws
prohibit
what
the
commission
did
not
say
is
these
contracts
involve
wagering
on
a
contingent
event
and
many
state
laws
make
wagering
on
a
contingent
event
unlawful
therefore
it
is
the
court
hypothetically
let
say
i
a
plaintiff
i
a
dcm
i
want
to
post
my
event
contract
about
whether
or
not
a
hurricane
will
hit
in
florida
and
the
commission
came
back
and
said
this
is
against
public
interest
and
it
also
falls
under
i
doing
this
out
of
order
it
falls
under
category
one
because
in
florida
and
elsewhere
the
state
law
prohibits
people
from
posting
or
making
bets
or
wagering
on
contingent
events
and
a
hurricane
is
a
contingent
event
and
this
contract
involves
a
wager
on
a
contingent
event
so
we
not
going
to
allow
it
would
that
be
allowed
under
this
statute
would
that
work
ms
stukes
i
think
it
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
the
statute
the
court
and
why
ms
stukes
and
it
because
this
statute
sets
forth
in
broad
terms
the
categories
that
are
the
subject
of
public
interest
review
and
none
of
those
categories
on
their
face
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
capture
all
event
contracts
and
it
the
court
right
that
their
point
i
think
that
exactly
what
they
saying
ms
stukes
i
think
actually
the
parties
agree
i
think
where
we
off
is
the
commission
does
agree
that
that
what
it
concluded
in
this
case
it
concluded
that
state
laws
forbid
wagering
on
elections
and
that
an
important
state
interest
that
kalshi
is
asking
the
commission
to
undermine
by
allowing
these
contracts
to
trade
on
a
federally
registered
exchange
a
federally
regulated
exchange
to
be
clear
the
commission
order
did
find
that
like
if
these
contracts
were
allowed
it
did
find
that
purchasing
one
of
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
illegal
in
jurisdictions
that
prohibit
betting
on
elections
by
statute
or
common
law
kalshi
argues
that
the
commission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
fell
afoul
of
the
law
because
it
ca
be
illegal
under
state
law
to
offer
the
contracts
on
a
market
regulated
by
the
cftc
because
fransha
ph
but
that
as
the
commission
held
in
its
order
misses
the
point
the
cea
is
a
federal
statutory
regime
for
the
regulation
of
commodities
derivatives
markets
and
it
does
preempt
state
laws
that
prohibit
the
trading
of
commodities
contracts
no
state
law
can
ban
a
contract
that
lawfully
listed
on
a
cftc
regulated
market
but
what
kalshi
asks
the
commission
to
do
here
and
what
kalshi
is
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
order
the
cftc
to
permit
these
contracts
when
kalshi
own
website
cites
news
articles
that
characterize
them
repeatedly
as
election
gambling
betting
on
elections
when
under
state
law
it
illegal
to
gamble
on
elections
and
this
by
the
way
is
the
reason
we
here
if
kalshi
could
lawfully
offer
election
betting
contracts
on
cftc
markets
it
could
ignore
any
state
law
that
disallows
election
gambling
even
states
that
allow
gambling
prohibit
betting
on
elections
and
that
indicates
that
the
concern
is
not
so
much
gambling
but
election
integrity
you
ca
place
a
bet
on
an
election
in
las
vegas
or
atlantic
city
for
the
cftc
to
allow
the
contracts
it
would
have
had
to
undermine
these
important
state
interests
and
so
when
the
commission
concluded
in
its
order
that
in
considering
whether
a
contract
involves
activity
under
state
law
it
considered
whether
the
activity
is
unlawful
under
state
laws
that
are
not
otherwise
preempted
by
the
cftc
laws
that
go
to
state
interest
that
are
not
overlapping
with
the
cea
regulatory
authority
and
when
the
commission
considers
that
it
can
consider
whether
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
commodities
markets
federal
commodities
derivatives
markets
should
be
used
to
subvert
important
state
interests
so
this
question
of
well
it
frustrating
to
me
i
an
advocate
i
should
be
frustrated
by
my
opponent
arguments
but
what
frustrating
to
me
about
that
is
this
concept
that
the
commission
interpretation
of
the
statute
does
make
sense
because
some
state
laws
make
it
illegal
to
place
a
wager
on
any
contingent
event
it
a
distraction
it
not
what
the
commission
held
here
the
commission
went
as
far
as
it
needed
to
go
because
this
is
an
informal
adjudication
it
one
case
under
a
different
set
of
facts
and
a
different
proposed
contract
it
might
look
to
that
language
it
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
the
statute
to
say
because
many
state
laws
prohibit
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
that
all
event
contracts
are
unlawful
it
would
be
an
usual
reading
of
a
statute
that
sets
forth
only
enumerated
categories
the
court
i
think
they
would
agree
with
that
ms
stukes
right
i
think
we
agree
on
that
the
court
well
i
do
think
you
want
to
agree
on
if
you
do
want
to
agree
on
that
i
think
you
want
to
distinguish
that
from
the
election
ms
stukes
no
what
i
am
saying
is
the
commission
did
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
state
laws
that
make
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
unlawful
the
commission
based
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
state
laws
that
make
election
wagering
unlawful
it
did
consider
in
its
decision
and
it
did
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
these
other
broader
state
laws
and
so
it
does
even
factor
in
to
the
review
here
whether
they
exist
or
not
it
was
the
basis
for
the
commission
decision
and
even
if
you
can
extrapolate
what
the
commission
was
not
doing
here
the
commission
was
ruling
here
it
went
only
as
far
as
it
needed
to
go
to
decide
the
issue
before
it
i
hope
that
that
is
coming
through
to
your
honor
so
here
because
these
contracts
have
as
their
essential
feature
not
that
they
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
but
they
are
wagering
on
the
outcome
of
elections
and
wagering
on
elections
is
unlawful
under
numerous
state
laws
the
commission
was
reasonable
in
its
determination
that
these
contracts
fit
within
that
category
of
unlawful
under
state
law
to
render
them
at
least
in
the
statute
in
subsection
i
can
move
on
to
talk
about
gaming
unless
you
want
to
talk
about
the
court
let
talk
about
gaming
ms
stukes
okay
again
with
the
term
gaming
the
commission
applied
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
gaming
to
conclude
that
these
contracts
would
fall
within
that
enumerated
category
again
gaming
is
not
a
defined
term
in
the
statute
and
so
what
the
commission
did
reasonably
is
look
to
its
ordinary
meaning
as
defined
in
dictionaries
and
in
ordinary
meanings
as
defined
in
state
law
and
federal
law
well
i
talk
about
that
in
a
second
and
concluded
that
it
falls
within
the
ordinary
that
those
proposed
contracts
which
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
fall
within
the
meaning
of
gaming
first
the
commission
looked
at
that
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
of
gaming
and
found
that
gaming
in
its
ordinary
dictionary
meaning
is
synonymous
or
interchangeable
with
gambling
and
that
actually
supported
in
the
congressional
record
when
we
see
that
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
where
the
first
thing
i
think
that
senator
lincoln
comment
says
is
this
section
of
the
cea
5cc5c
is
intended
to
prevent
gambling
using
the
futures
markets
for
gambling
the
court
how
do
you
define
gambling
ms
stukes
let
me
come
back
to
the
definition
so
gaming
in
ordinary
dictionary
definitions
is
synonymous
with
gambling
there
actually
a
supreme
court
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
also
for
that
proposition
they
interchangeable
terms
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
so
what
gambling
the
commission
looked
at
various
definitions
under
state
law
of
how
gambling
is
defined
and
a
common
thread
in
many
state
law
definitions
of
gambling
is
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
it
within
a
common
thread
a
frequently
used
phrasing
included
in
the
definition
of
gambling
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
a
number
of
states
linked
the
terms
gaming
or
gambling
to
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
the
commission
also
looked
at
this
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
which
has
the
definition
of
to
bet
or
wager
betting
or
wagering
is
a
common
definition
of
gambling
and
in
that
statute
wagering
on
a
contest
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
is
included
in
the
definition
the
court
can
i
ask
you
a
question
ms
stukes
yeah
absolutely
the
court
besides
elections
in
your
view
is
there
a
contest
of
others
that
does
involve
a
game
as
plaintiff
would
define
what
game
means
ms
stukes
i
actually
thought
the
horse
race
was
a
game
but
there
are
contests
academy
awards
award
types
of
things
that
does
seem
like
a
game
just
seems
like
a
contest
so
the
court
okay
so
an
event
contract
on
something
about
one
of
these
awards
would
fall
under
the
gaming
or
gambling
prong
ms
stukes
first
of
all
i
do
want
to
get
ahead
of
my
commission
which
the
commission
did
define
it
define
did
talk
about
whether
the
in
this
order
did
get
into
other
examples
because
it
was
sufficient
to
determine
that
elections
fall
within
this
ordinary
definition
of
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
the
court
right
i
trying
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
what
the
terms
mean
in
the
statute
so
it
certainly
relevant
for
me
to
understand
how
this
would
apply
even
beyond
this
case
while
i
know
i
only
looking
at
the
order
in
this
case
so
based
on
what
you
said
an
event
contract
about
any
kind
of
contest
like
an
award
show
academy
award
grammy
ms
stukes
it
not
a
game
it
seems
like
a
contest
the
court
that
would
fall
under
the
gaming
prong
ms
stukes
wagering
on
it
it
sounds
look
it
might
yeah
the
court
keep
going
ms
stukes
so
one
of
the
criticisms
that
kalshi
levies
at
the
commission
decision
here
is
they
say
that
the
definition
is
gerrymandered
because
it
includes
only
wagering
something
or
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
and
gaming
can
be
so
much
more
than
that
gaming
can
be
games
gaming
can
be
so
much
more
than
that
what
the
commission
did
however
is
it
looked
at
what
are
these
contracts
these
contracts
are
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
elections
does
that
fit
in
an
ordinary
definition
of
gaming
we
submit
yes
because
gaming
is
interchangeable
with
gambling
and
ordinary
meaning
of
gambling
is
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
and
an
election
is
a
contest
by
its
plain
meaning
dictionary
definitions
define
contest
to
include
elections
the
examples
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
talk
about
the
presidential
election
as
a
contest
the
presidential
contest
meaning
an
election
so
gaming
reasonably
and
plainly
includes
by
its
plain
meaning
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
contest
of
others
this
might
not
be
to
the
exclusion
of
other
types
of
gaming
and
gambling
that
were
not
at
issue
in
this
particular
matter
but
these
contracts
are
designed
to
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
the
court
but
the
definitions
do
change
based
on
the
contract
at
issue
right
the
statute
says
what
it
says
ms
stukes
the
statute
says
what
it
says
the
court
and
it
your
role
to
determine
whether
you
undertake
this
type
of
review
under
the
statute
then
you
decide
or
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contract
fits
the
definition
so
the
definition
does
change
it
whether
the
contract
fits
the
definition
so
it
ca
be
i
not
going
to
find
gambling
means
contest
here
and
then
in
another
case
be
given
a
different
definition
from
the
commission
about
what
gambling
might
mean
based
on
the
contract
at
issue
there
that
not
what
you
suggesting
ms
stukes
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
because
this
is
not
a
rule
making
that
the
commission
determination
of
whether
these
contracts
fit
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
did
not
require
the
commission
to
define
gaming
entire
universe
for
it
to
determine
that
these
contracts
fit
within
an
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
the
court
i
guess
that
what
i
having
difficulty
with
because
what
i
hearing
you
say
is
that
there
could
be
many
definitions
and
we
pick
the
one
applicable
here
if
there
are
many
definitions
i
hope
no
one
is
asking
me
to
find
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute
this
is
not
the
time
to
deal
with
ambiguities
in
statutory
interpretation
so
i
guess
i
mean
i
hope
that
the
commission
is
taking
the
position
that
gaming
means
x
and
that
this
contract
fits
x
because
of
whatever
argument
you
not
saying
that
you
adding
a
contest
here
but
in
other
circumstance
you
use
another
dictionary
definition
there
should
be
a
definition
that
applies
that
unambiguous
ms
stukes
what
the
commission
found
here
is
an
ordinary
definition
of
gaming
includes
wagering
on
a
contest
of
others
because
and
that
not
as
kalshi
puts
it
gerrymandering
the
court
i
can
accept
that
ms
stukes
that
deciding
what
before
it
the
court
i
can
accept
that
in
the
dictionary
there
may
be
one
two
three
and
if
it
fits
any
of
those
prongs
i
just
want
to
know
the
extent
of
what
the
definition
of
gambling
is
under
the
commission
view
so
what
you
saying
is
it
includes
this
contest
of
others
and
so
because
an
election
in
your
view
is
a
contest
of
others
then
betting
or
wagering
on
that
violates
that
provision
of
the
statute
ms
stukes
or
at
least
brings
it
into
that
enumerated
category
of
the
statute
yes
the
court
okay
but
if
there
are
other
definitions
of
gambling
and
i
losing
track
of
whether
i
saw
it
myself
or
whether
it
in
the
papers
but
that
would
just
say
for
example
you
might
have
said
it
earlier
betting
or
wagering
on
a
contingent
event
ms
stukes
on
any
contingent
event
the
court
on
any
contingent
event
would
that
mean
that
every
event
contract
involves
gambling
and
thus
gaming
ms
stukes
that
not
what
the
commission
held
here
and
it
unlikely
to
be
what
the
commission
would
hold
in
another
context
if
it
came
up
but
that
was
the
question
presented
here
so
what
was
presented
here
was
do
these
contracts
which
are
routinely
characterized
as
election
betting
contracts
fall
within
the
ordinary
meaning
an
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
where
gaming
is
synonymous
with
gambling
and
gambling
includes
wagering
on
a
contest
of
others
and
a
contest
of
others
includes
elections
and
that
was
enough
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
to
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
we
talked
about
gaming
and
unlawful
under
state
law
and
involve
and
unless
your
honor
wants
to
talk
further
about
any
of
those
subissues
i
can
move
on
to
the
public
interest
the
court
sure
yes
please
ms
stukes
okay
so
having
determined
that
kalshi
proposed
contracts
involve
two
enumerated
activities
under
the
statute
the
commission
proceeded
to
determine
that
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
public
interest
and
therefore
are
prohibited
from
trading
and
in
making
this
determination
the
commission
considered
the
contract
economic
purpose
as
well
as
other
factors
so
i
start
with
the
economic
purpose
evaluation
so
the
parties
point
this
out
in
our
briefs
but
our
statute
here
the
cea
codifies
two
public
interests
in
commodities
markets
hedging
and
price
discovery
so
hedging
in
general
means
to
use
the
commodity
derivatives
markets
to
manage
risk
of
price
fluctuations
in
commodities
for
example
we
put
in
our
brief
an
example
of
an
airline
they
have
to
buy
jet
fuel
to
operate
their
business
and
they
have
a
price
sensitivity
to
movements
in
the
price
of
jet
fuel
so
a
market
participant
who
wants
to
hedge
their
risk
of
price
fluctuations
and
they
worried
that
the
price
of
a
commodity
will
go
up
will
hedge
that
risk
by
entering
into
a
commodity
derivatives
contract
whose
value
will
go
up
if
the
price
of
that
commodity
increases
so
in
other
words
hedging
means
you
can
enter
into
a
derivatives
contract
in
a
cftc
regulated
market
that
will
move
in
your
financial
interest
if
the
commodity
that
you
sensitive
to
moves
against
your
financial
interest
that
hedging
price
discovery
which
is
the
other
enumerated
public
interest
in
the
cea
and
in
commodity
derivatives
markets
generally
means
to
determine
a
price
level
for
a
commodity
based
upon
its
pricing
in
a
cftc
regulated
market
so
for
instance
futures
contracts
on
like
agricultural
commodities
can
be
used
the
trading
on
futures
contracts
can
be
used
to
discover
the
price
of
the
actual
commodity
in
the
cash
market
as
noted
in
the
order
the
commission
considered
the
public
interest
of
kalshi
proposed
contracts
and
considered
their
economic
purpose
so
this
statute
5cc5c
does
define
what
it
means
to
consider
the
public
interest
but
because
the
cea
itself
codifies
economic
interests
in
the
years
before
2000
when
the
cftc
examined
every
derivatives
contract
for
public
interest
it
looked
at
an
economic
purpose
test
that
asked
whether
a
contract
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
be
or
has
been
used
for
hedging
or
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
that
was
the
test
and
the
cftc
looked
at
that
test
in
considering
whether
these
proposed
contracts
have
an
economic
purpose
and
the
cftc
also
mentioned
this
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
which
senator
feinstein
asked
if
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominate
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative
as
opposed
to
hedging
or
economic
use
so
the
commission
cited
both
of
these
formulations
of
considering
the
economic
purpose
of
the
contracts
in
evaluating
these
proposed
contracts
and
it
considered
comments
that
kalshi
highlighted
for
your
honor
that
congressional
control
has
economic
effects
and
it
considered
comments
from
commenters
that
said
they
would
use
these
contracts
to
hedge
but
as
the
commission
found
the
economic
effects
of
one
chamber
of
congress
or
another
are
the
word
the
commission
used
is
diffuse
and
unpredictable
the
price
of
these
contracts
is
not
correlated
to
the
price
of
any
commodity
and
so
the
price
of
the
contracts
could
reasonably
or
predictably
be
used
to
establish
commercial
transaction
prices
for
hedging
or
discovery
the
court
can
i
get
a
clarification
is
the
test
is
it
the
more
than
occasional
language
or
is
it
the
predominantly
for
commercial
purpose
ms
stukes
the
test
the
commission
evaluated
both
it
looked
at
both
and
found
that
even
considering
the
comments
that
suggested
pardon
me
that
these
contracts
would
be
used
for
hedging
purposes
most
of
the
comments
suggested
that
the
hedging
uses
were
not
really
related
to
the
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
but
rather
the
ultimate
changes
in
law
or
policy
that
could
be
affected
many
steps
down
the
line
from
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
so
even
taking
all
the
commenters
together
who
stated
an
intent
to
hedge
economic
risk
by
trading
these
contracts
it
did
establish
that
the
contracts
would
be
used
for
hedging
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
but
even
if
there
were
robust
economic
purposes
for
these
contracts
the
economic
purpose
of
the
contracts
was
just
one
aspect
of
the
evaluation
here
because
a
contract
with
economic
purpose
an
event
contract
even
if
it
has
an
economic
purpose
it
does
make
it
per
se
in
the
public
interest
there
an
example
actually
in
the
colloquy
of
the
congressional
record
you
can
have
a
contract
on
whether
a
terrorist
event
will
occur
and
it
could
be
used
for
hedging
even
if
you
going
to
suffer
an
economic
consequence
from
that
it
does
make
it
in
the
public
interest
it
does
make
it
a
good
idea
so
the
commission
here
considered
the
alleged
economic
purposes
of
these
contracts
and
it
found
that
these
contracts
could
not
because
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
the
impact
for
economic
hedging
is
so
diffuse
there
are
so
many
steps
that
are
involved
between
the
election
and
actual
enactment
of
legislation
that
the
economic
purpose
of
these
contracts
did
not
weigh
in
favor
of
their
public
interest
but
it
considered
other
aspects
too
i
want
to
address
one
thing
that
kalshi
argues
that
the
commission
imposed
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
direct
effects
test
stating
that
these
contracts
do
have
a
direct
economic
effect
simply
because
a
single
chamber
of
congress
does
itself
have
the
power
to
enact
law
is
not
an
arbitrary
test
it
a
description
of
the
limited
hedging
utility
that
these
contracts
would
have
but
again
even
if
these
contracts
had
a
robust
economic
purpose
other
factors
play
in
to
the
public
interest
determination
and
they
did
here
so
i
talk
about
election
integrity
unless
your
honor
would
like
to
talk
about
the
economic
purpose
the
court
i
guess
the
only
question
is
plaintiff
made
an
argument
in
their
briefs
and
i
talked
to
them
a
little
today
about
even
putting
aside
any
legislation
that
passed
just
the
mere
fact
of
elections
that
dictate
who
is
in
control
of
what
chamber
has
maybe
impact
on
the
stock
market
or
other
direct
economic
consequences
that
are
real
and
tangible
and
that
can
be
observed
in
the
aftermath
of
elections
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
your
response
was
to
that
ms
stukes
my
response
is
maybe
something
you
already
said
which
is
even
if
there
are
economic
benefits
to
trading
these
contracts
the
commission
determined
in
its
discretion
that
those
were
not
outweighed
by
the
very
serious
public
interest
the
court
so
you
do
dispute
that
ms
stukes
i
find
that
even
if
it
true
it
does
make
a
difference
because
the
commission
was
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
its
determination
that
the
concerns
about
election
integrity
here
overwhelmingly
are
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
court
okay
let
go
to
the
election
integrity
ms
stukes
so
factors
including
specific
concerns
about
election
integrity
supported
the
commission
determination
that
the
contracts
were
contrary
to
public
interest
and
the
principal
concerns
that
the
commission
identified
included
that
these
contracts
could
create
monetary
incentives
for
individuals
or
organized
groups
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
for
financial
gain
to
win
a
bet
not
the
court
and
before
you
said
to
win
a
bet
i
was
thinking
you
describing
what
i
think
happens
now
in
real
life
in
terms
of
the
financial
incentives
of
people
putting
money
behind
elections
and
what
motivates
people
to
vote
for
certain
candidates
is
often
financial
in
nature
right
but
you
saying
specifically
to
collect
on
these
event
contracts
ms
stukes
these
event
contracts
their
very
existence
would
establish
could
establish
a
financial
incentive
to
vote
in
a
particular
way
that
does
presently
exist
because
these
contracts
are
not
traded
anywhere
you
ca
gamble
on
elections
so
they
can
incentivize
voting
in
particular
ways
that
could
influence
how
people
vote
the
court
how
would
we
ever
measure
that
ms
stukes
well
the
the
court
the
reason
i
asking
is
because
i
think
the
plaintiff
argument
is
that
concern
is
so
unlikely
to
happen
it
and
i
thought
that
they
made
a
good
argument
today
that
there
are
already
so
many
incentives
financial
and
otherwise
behind
elections
that
motivate
people
to
do
certain
things
i
mean
the
point
being
that
if
there
were
some
way
to
get
control
over
a
if
someone
could
figure
out
a
way
to
ensure
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
that
probably
would
have
happened
by
now
right
so
what
is
your
response
to
that
ms
stukes
my
response
is
the
existence
of
a
federally
regulated
derivatives
contract
on
the
outcome
of
elections
could
incentivize
people
to
manipulate
either
that
contract
or
the
election
itself
for
financial
gain
i
give
you
some
examples
to
talk
about
the
kind
of
thing
we
concerned
about
and
i
skipping
ahead
to
the
order
i
was
going
to
talk
with
you
about
these
things
the
commission
is
not
just
a
regulatory
agency
we
also
a
law
enforcement
agency
and
we
tasked
under
the
cea
with
antifraud
authority
and
we
tasked
under
the
cea
to
ensure
integrity
in
the
markets
that
we
oversee
and
because
of
that
the
commission
could
be
drawn
in
to
investigating
manipulative
conduct
in
these
markets
in
a
way
that
does
outside
of
its
ordinary
mission
so
here
an
example
a
political
activist
with
a
big
social
media
following
they
float
a
rumor
on
social
media
damaging
to
a
candidate
who
is
important
to
one
party
control
of
the
senate
in
a
couple
of
weeks
this
rumor
spins
up
and
spins
out
and
it
turns
out
maybe
it
untrue
it
turns
out
to
be
false
but
during
the
weeks
that
the
rumor
was
circulating
the
congressional
control
contract
on
the
other
party
goes
up
and
many
people
make
a
lot
of
money
by
selling
that
contract
when
the
market
is
high
and
then
the
cftc
gets
a
tip
and
says
well
that
person
put
that
rumor
on
social
media
in
order
to
manipulate
the
congressional
control
contract
there
a
couple
of
implications
here
the
very
availability
of
that
contract
has
added
one
more
reason
and
maybe
a
big
reason
for
some
people
to
disseminate
false
information
about
elections
and
that
certainly
relevant
to
the
public
interest
another
thing
that
the
commission
considered
here
is
that
it
would
draw
the
commission
into
investigating
these
kinds
of
activities
and
that
not
farfetched
the
court
is
that
something
that
the
commission
is
tasked
with
doing
now
i
assuming
there
are
other
contract
i
probably
could
come
up
with
an
example
of
any
contract
that
could
be
subject
to
some
manipulation
where
there
money
involved
is
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
commission
would
typically
investigate
if
there
was
an
issue
with
okay
ms
stukes
absolutely
your
honor
as
a
federal
regulator
of
commodities
markets
the
cftc
as
i
said
is
in
charge
of
ensuring
price
integrity
on
our
federally
regulated
exchanges
in
the
ordinary
course
there
many
ways
to
manipulate
markets
now
i
say
this
in
the
same
breath
that
i
say
i
think
the
markets
regulated
by
the
cftc
are
among
the
safest
in
the
rule
but
the
limit
of
manipulation
is
really
just
the
limit
of
human
ingenuity
manipulation
is
attempted
and
the
cftc
as
a
law
enforcement
agency
routinely
investigates
allegations
of
fraud
and
manipulation
in
the
markets
that
it
oversees
the
court
i
asked
that
because
when
i
read
your
brief
it
sounded
like
one
of
the
arguments
you
were
making
was
that
if
you
had
to
do
that
in
this
circumstance
it
would
put
you
in
a
position
that
the
cftc
is
not
equipped
to
do
but
it
sound
like
if
it
part
of
your
regular
mission
it
would
put
you
in
a
position
that
you
not
already
required
or
routinely
do
ms
stukes
my
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
there
are
two
important
differences
because
this
is
not
a
minimal
concern
it
not
simple
enough
to
say
oh
but
you
investigate
manipulation
in
markets
that
you
not
an
expert
in
all
the
time
and
it
true
we
have
a
division
of
enforcement
that
investigates
alleged
manipulation
in
a
lot
of
markets
on
a
lot
of
commodities
the
difference
here
there
are
two
important
differences
first
and
most
important
any
government
investigation
and
enforcement
activity
involving
the
political
process
is
inherently
sensitive
there
a
difference
in
the
cftc
investigating
economic
activity
related
to
commodity
derivatives
markets
and
the
cftc
investigating
acts
that
may
be
political
speech
or
other
conduct
central
to
the
political
process
second
as
we
briefed
and
as
the
commission
found
in
its
order
most
of
the
markets
regulated
by
the
cftc
have
objective
economic
data
that
may
not
totally
decide
a
case
but
at
a
minimum
it
provides
some
objective
grounding
through
the
cftc
investigations
of
whether
manipulation
has
occurred
the
vast
potential
of
these
contracts
to
incentivize
misinformation
could
absolutely
draw
the
commission
into
investigations
of
a
vast
array
of
possible
manipulation
the
pricing
of
these
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
impacted
by
such
a
broad
array
of
information
anything
that
could
influence
the
election
could
influence
the
price
of
these
contracts
so
polls
rumors
news
announcements
faked
information
advertisement
i
ca
even
think
of
it
all
and
this
would
be
for
every
congressional
race
in
the
country
kalshi
does
have
jurisdiction
to
investigate
any
alleged
manipulation
on
these
contracts
it
would
fall
to
the
cftc
in
its
everyday
operation
the
cftc
receives
tips
of
possible
market
manipulation
and
it
would
be
drawn
into
investigating
whether
information
disseminated
about
congressional
elections
illegally
manipulated
the
market
in
these
contracts
and
that
is
not
a
role
for
which
the
commission
is
equipped
and
it
would
greatly
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
cftc
assuming
the
role
of
an
election
cop
raises
very
serious
concerns
about
not
only
the
misalignment
of
that
role
with
the
commission
mission
and
its
history
but
with
election
integrity
and
it
was
reasonable
for
the
cftc
to
have
considered
this
as
another
example
it
not
farfetched
it
not
a
de
minimus
concern
kalshi
says
oh
it
not
a
big
deal
you
do
that
anyway
or
it
not
likely
to
happen
the
commission
predicted
judgment
based
upon
its
existence
as
a
law
enforcement
agency
that
routinely
investigates
manipulation
and
as
a
regulatory
agency
that
is
entrusted
with
ensuring
the
integrity
of
its
markets
it
was
a
reasonable
predictive
judgment
to
say
that
that
would
draw
the
cftc
into
investigating
conduct
that
relates
to
elections
there
another
example
there
another
example
i
wanted
to
talk
with
your
honor
about
and
that
would
be
you
asked
kalshi
counsel
about
the
limits
that
it
proposed
to
put
on
who
could
trade
these
contracts
as
far
as
i
read
that
list
it
would
prohibit
people
who
count
the
votes
from
trading
in
these
contracts
so
imagine
a
scenario
and
the
position
limits
meaning
how
much
can
be
traded
on
these
contracts
the
position
limits
proposed
would
allow
trading
of
up
to
5
million
if
you
a
company
or
entity
so
imagine
a
group
of
poll
workers
and
i
do
mean
people
that
are
involved
in
surveys
i
mean
people
that
count
the
votes
they
form
a
company
of
some
kind
and
they
accused
of
putting
their
money
together
and
putting
a
5
million
position
on
these
congressional
control
contracts
these
are
the
people
counting
the
votes
someone
refers
this
to
the
cftc
because
they
think
the
vote
counting
has
been
manipulated
to
make
a
profit
in
the
event
contract
so
here
would
be
the
cftc
being
drawn
into
whether
the
vote
count
is
accurate
the
court
or
whether
there
was
fraud
in
connection
with
the
event
contract
right
ms
stukes
correct
because
it
would
ask
the
question
of
whether
there
was
fraud
in
the
event
contract
because
that
would
be
manipulating
manipulative
or
fraudulent
conduct
that
unduly
influenced
the
event
contract
and
that
an
example
of
the
cftc
concern
because
these
contracts
could
their
very
existence
could
incentivize
conduct
designed
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
for
the
purpose
of
manipulating
the
price
of
the
contract
for
financial
gain
or
they
could
incentivize
the
manipulation
of
the
market
for
the
purpose
of
artificially
affecting
the
election
or
perceptions
of
the
election
i
want
to
mention
one
thing
that
kalshi
talks
about
and
that
is
oh
actually
before
i
get
there
research
in
the
record
one
comment
submitted
in
the
record
involved
the
actual
manipulation
of
a
political
event
contract
by
false
information
there
was
it
a
bizarre
fact
pattern
the
pop
singer
kid
rock
was
shown
to
be
ahead
in
the
polls
in
a
match
up
against
a
sitting
senator
before
he
had
ever
he
had
not
even
declared
a
candidacy
for
the
senate
but
he
was
shown
in
a
poll
to
be
ahead
of
a
sitting
senator
and
that
caused
the
price
of
a
corresponding
event
contract
to
drop
and
it
caused
trading
volume
to
surge
and
users
were
later
on
social
media
bragging
about
how
that
poll
trolled
the
news
media
and
influenced
the
election
event
contract
researchers
have
theorized
that
that
kind
of
fake
information
could
be
used
to
generate
market
movement
in
other
election
event
contracts
so
it
not
farfetched
to
say
that
this
is
a
serious
concern
over
600
comment
letters
were
received
by
the
agency
including
from
senators
and
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
expressing
significant
concerns
about
election
integrity
and
the
improper
commodification
of
our
elections
and
i
do
say
commodification
just
as
rhetorical
flourish
when
you
have
an
event
contract
trading
on
a
cftc
regulated
market
and
the
underlying
event
of
that
contract
is
an
election
the
election
is
a
commodity
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
where
a
large
number
of
states
have
specifically
disallowed
gambling
on
elections
by
either
statute
or
common
law
and
that
reflects
the
view
of
a
large
number
of
states
that
this
kind
of
wagering
is
against
the
public
interest
the
commission
grants
significant
weight
to
any
threat
to
election
integrity
as
well
as
the
threat
to
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
this
is
especially
important
at
a
point
in
time
where
so
many
people
question
the
validity
of
elections
the
commission
is
not
required
to
let
threats
to
election
integrity
happen
before
recognizing
election
integrity
as
a
public
interest
concern
with
respect
to
these
contracts
there
one
other
value
that
kalshi
argues
that
kalshi
and
amici
and
commenters
argue
that
these
contracts
have
and
that
is
that
they
could
provide
beneficial
market
based
predictive
data
and
that
that
societally
valuable
information
the
commission
considered
that
but
it
did
find
that
generation
of
such
data
outweighed
the
very
real
and
grave
concerns
about
the
threat
to
election
integrity
that
these
contracts
would
pose
the
cftc
predictive
judgment
about
possible
negative
consequences
that
could
arise
from
these
proposed
contracts
are
entitled
to
deference
under
apa
law
the
commission
did
ignore
evidence
it
did
refuse
to
engage
with
contrary
positions
it
found
that
any
economic
utility
of
the
contracts
did
outweigh
the
very
serious
risks
that
the
contracts
could
be
manipulated
and
could
incentivize
the
spread
of
misinformation
or
be
used
to
undermine
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of
election
integrity
so
for
all
of
these
reasons
the
cftc
submits
that
your
honor
should
deny
kalshi
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
grant
judgment
to
the
cftc
the
court
okay
thank
you
any
brief
rebuttal
mr
roth
very
brief
very
very
brief
the
court
yes
mr
roth
i
appreciate
the
court
time
i
will
be
very
very
brief
three
quick
points
first
your
honor
asked
about
the
catchall
category
why
they
did
rely
on
the
catchall
the
court
yes
mr
roth
the
catchall
requires
a
rule
making
it
by
rule
or
regulation
they
have
done
a
rule
making
and
so
that
they
could
rely
on
the
catchall
the
court
they
could
not
rely
on
the
catchall
mr
roth
yes
so
they
would
first
have
to
do
a
rule
making
to
determine
some
activity
is
similar
to
the
others
they
have
not
done
that
so
that
the
answer
to
that
the
court
thank
you
i
appreciate
that
mr
roth
on
unlawful
i
still
did
not
really
hear
a
theory
as
to
why
their
reading
does
sweep
in
everything
what
i
heard
was
you
do
have
to
worry
about
that
because
that
not
this
case
that
not
how
statutory
interpretation
works
we
need
to
understand
what
the
statute
means
counsel
admitted
that
a
de
novo
question
for
this
court
to
consider
and
of
course
in
considering
what
the
statute
means
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
how
it
would
apply
in
other
contexts
that
does
mean
you
need
to
figure
out
the
answer
to
every
other
hypothetical
case
that
might
exist
but
the
supreme
court
whenever
it
considering
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
looks
at
how
it
going
to
apply
elsewhere
and
if
it
going
to
be
absurd
in
a
wide
variety
of
other
cases
that
means
it
a
bad
interpretation
that
i
think
covers
unlawful
the
only
thing
i
say
about
gaming
to
add
to
earlier
your
honor
asked
if
their
interpretation
of
contests
would
sweep
in
anything
that
is
a
game
other
than
elections
and
counsel
response
was
potentially
awards
shows
like
who
going
to
win
the
emmy
or
the
oscar
which
i
thought
was
a
fascinating
example
because
kalshi
offers
those
and
has
offered
those
for
a
long
time
and
they
have
never
subjected
those
to
the
review
process
and
i
think
that
really
underscores
the
sort
of
outcome
driven
aspect
of
this
it
not
a
good
faith
statutory
interpretation
it
an
attempt
to
get
it
in
without
a
real
coherent
theory
of
what
the
statute
means
that
all
i
have
your
honor
unless
you
have
further
questions
the
court
no
thank
you
i
appreciate
the
briefs
were
very
good
and
helpful
and
i
appreciate
your
time
before
we
leave

going
to
embarrass
franklin
