however
we
have
significant
concerns
with
both
the
proposalʼs
content
and
the
analytical
approach
it
takes
to
support
the
proposed
amendments
the
proposal
would
effect
a
ban
on
certain
types
of
event
contracts
on
a
categorical
basis
by
adopting
a
broad
and
vague
definition
of
gamingˮ
and
determining
that
gamingˮ
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
not
only
oversteps
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
and
departs
from
a
longstanding
practice
of
making
determinations
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
but
it
is
also
economically
unsound
the
commission
has
failed
to
recognize
the
positive
impact
of
prediction
markets
on
the
economy
in
its
statutorily
required
cost
benefit
analysis
under
commodity

cea

we
urge
the
commision
to
withdraw
this
proposal

instead
adopt

the

coinbase
introduction
we
strongly
encourage
the
commission
to
withdraw
the
proposal
not
only
do
we
disagree
with
its
substance
we
also
believe
it
goes
beyond
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
to
prohibit
entire
categories
of
contracts
instead
of
allowing
prediction
markets
to
develop
and
flourish
within
the
regulatory
protections
of
the
cea
and
commission
regulations
and
thereby
provide
new
avenues
for
price
discovery
and
hedging
of
economically
consequential
events
the
commission
is
proposing
to
ban
them
under
a
mistaken
belief
that
it
is
protecting
american
customers
from
harm
the
cea
gives
designated
contract
markets
dcms
broad
leeway
to
list
event
contracts
using
a
self
certification
process
but
also
prohibits
a
dcm
from
listing
any
event
contract
that
the
commission
determines
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
in
section
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
assassination
war
terrorism
gaming
in
other
words
following
a
two
step
process
the
commission
must
first
find
that
the
event
contract
involvesˮ
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
then
subsequently
determine
that
the
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
plain
language
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
consistent
with
the
current
commission
approach
of
making
these
determinations
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
the
proposal
seeks
to
deviate
from
this
longstanding
and
well
established
practice
in
its
place
the
commission
proposes
to
use
its
rulemaking
authority
to
define
the
term
gamingˮ
to
incorporate
events
that
go
well
beyond
a
plain
meaning
of
that
term
and
by
doing
so
categorically
deny
a
dcm
the
ability
to
list
contracts
that
reference
them
regardless
of
whether
any
particular
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
while
the
cea
permits
the
commission
to
write
rules
that
cover
similar
activities
this
approach
is
wrong
it
removes
important
discretion
that
should
be
afforded
to
both
the
commission
and
market
participants
with
respect
to
future
listing
determinations
we
firmly
believe
that
this
all
or
nothing
approach
to
the
treatment
of
event
contracts
is
not
consistent
with
the
promotion
of
responsible
innovation
and
growth
in
regulated
transparent
markets
with
appropriate
safeguards
to
protect
market
integrity
and
protect
customers
our
core
concern
is
the
proposalʼs
overly
broad
definition
of
if
adopted
rule
would
capture
contracts
as
gamingˮ
that
by
any
common
understanding
are
not
in
fact
gaming
few
would
agree
that
elections
or
professional
awards
such
as
nobel
prizes
or
academy
awards
are
granted
through
a
process
that
should
generally
qualify
as
games
yet
these
are
the
examples
presented
as
constituting
such
a
definition
as
we
describe
in
more
detail
below
this
is
inconsistent
with
both
the
cea
and
the
supporting
legislative
history
related
to
gaming
neither
of
which
suggest
that
gaming
should
extend
beyond
sporting
events
a
consequence
of
the
overly
broad
definition
is
that
many
economically
viable
contracts
would
be
prohibited
for
reasons
contrary
to
a
public
interest
finding
this
is
a
mistake
critically
the
proposal
fails
to
recognize
the
value
of
prediction
markets
the
proposal
questions
their
scientific
merit
and
highlights
their
potential
to
harm
investors
but
without
citing
evidence
to
support
these
conclusions
instead
the
proposal
laments
that
event
contracts
do
not
work
like
those
that
the
commission
is
familiar
with
because
the
event
contracts
do
not
have
underlying
cash
markets
and
that
somehow
this
innovation
is
inconsistent
with
a
public
interest
proposal
at
48982
it
is
also
incumbent
on
the
commission
to
meet
its
statutory
obligation
set
forth
in
cea
section
to
fully
account
for
the
costs
and
benefits
to
market
participants
of
prohibiting
event
contracts
including
the
impact
on
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
futures
markets
7
the
proposal
fails
to
do
this
which
is
a
shortcoming
that
needs
to
be
corrected
as
discussed
below
the
commission
fails
to
recognize
the
important
risk
management
tools
event
contracts
can
provide
as
well
as
other
important
public
interest
considerations
described
in
this
response
instead
the
proposal
exclusively
focuses
on
the
lack
of
commission
resources
to
conduct
a
contract
by
contract
review
via
the
self
certification
process
and
how
this
will
also
save
market
participant
compliance
resources
because
they
will
not
have
to
bother
listing
products
proposal
at
48972
we
disagree
that
this
is
an
appropriate
basis
for
the
commissionʼs
proposed
categorical
ban
the
commission
and
congress
should
instead
focus
on
ensuring
the
commission
has
the
needed
resources
to
continue
its
self
certificationˮ
process
that
has
by
all
accounts
worked
well
across
industries
and
market
types
to
the
extent
the
commission
believes
that
it
must
move
forward
with
this
rulemaking
the
focus
should
not
be
on
a
broad
definition
of
gaming
instead
the
commission
should
focus
on
types
of
event
contracts
that
are
sufficiently
similar
to
each
other
such
that
the
commission
is
able
to
conduct
a
comprehensive
public
interest
analysis
applicable
to
all
potential
contracts
of
that
type
only
if
the
commission
can
then
demonstrate
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
meeting
all
statutory
requirements
in
making
that
determination
should
those
contracts
be
prohibited
under
commission
rule
along
with
certain
contracts
referencing
terrorism
assassination
gaming
and
war
the
commission
should
not
review
event
contracts
on
a
categorical
basis
the
commission
suggests
that
it
is
not
required
to
make
a
public
interest
determination
on
a
contract
specific
basis
and
that
the
cea
authorizes
categorical
public
interest
determinations
proposal
at
48978
we
disagree
the
commissionʼs
proposal
to
review
contracts
as
a
category
is
not
contemplated
by
the
cea
departs
from
long
standing
practice
in
commission
regulated
markets
and
would
harm
innovation
in
event
contract
markets
while
it
may
be
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
think
about
categories
of
contracts
in
developing
principles
with
which
to
inform
their
determinations
adopting
a
broad
categorical
determination
approach
to
event
contracts
is
a
flawed
method
to
review
novel
products
and
risks
upending
the
commissionʼs
longstanding
product
review
framework
for
the
following
reasons
we
believe
the
proposalʼs
approach
exceeds
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
first
congress
did
not
direct
the
commission
to
define
gamingˮ
in
cea
section
clearly
evidenced
by
the
very
next
subclause
cea
section
which
provides
that
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulationˮ
can
determine
whether
other
similar
activityˮ
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
second
the
proposal
fails
to
establish
a
basis
for
an
overly
expansive
definition
of
the
proposalʼs
definition
is
broader
than
what
can
be
reasonably
established
based
on
the
legislative
history
and
remarks
by
legislators
nowhere
does
the
legislative
history
suggest
that
gaming
includes
elections
awards
or
even
contests
more
generally
outside
of
sporting
events
instead
the
commission
seems
to
be
taking
the
approach
that
gaming
is
not
only
speculative
but
that
speculation
itself
is
gaming
and
therefore
a
rational
basis
for
expanding
the
set
of
events
that
qualify
as
gaming
the
proposal
wholly
fails
to
clearly
articulate
a
basis
for
distinguishing
certain
behavior
as
market
speculationˮ
and
other
activity
as
gamingˮ
or
finally
nowhere
does
the
statute
indicate
that
all
gaming
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
the
contrary
the
statute
authorizes
the
commission
to
prohibit
only
gaming
contracts
that
it
deems
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
commission
otherwise
believes
that
an
event
contract
outside
of
those
already
enumerated
in
the
statute
involves
specific
activity
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
should
then
make
that
determination
by
rule
or
regulationˮ
as
provided
by
cea
section
for
these
reasons
the
commissionʼs
proposed
approach
of
establishing
a
broad
definition
of
gamingˮ
and
then
prohibiting
contracts
that
fit
under
that
definition
is
statutorily
infirm
if
the
commission
does
not
take
a
more
tailored
approach
the
rule
will
inevitably
be
used
to
reject
new
types
of
event
contracts
for
which
a
dcm
could
otherwise
make
a
viable
public
interest
argument
through
the
well
established
self
certification
process
had
such
broad
authority
been
exercised
in
the
past
it
could
have
prevented
for
example
the
introduction
of
financial
futuresˮ
should
the
commission
have
concluded
in
its
nascent
days
that
it
did
not
have
adequate
economic
purpose
or
public
interest
benefit
in
the
case
of
event
contracts
we
do
not
believe
that
this
commission
should
handcuff
the
discretion
of
future
commissions
by
making
sweeping
determinations
about
a
market
that
is
at
the
early
stages
of
development
and
maturation
more
to
the
point
the
current
process
for
product
listings
is
not
broken
the
commission
has
historically
reviewed
new
product
submissions
through
its
part
40
rules
for
self
certification
or
commission
approval
the
process
includes
a
submission
for
each
contract
that
demonstrates
among
other
things
the
productʼs
terms
a
concise
explanation
and
analysis
of
the
product
and
its
compliance
with
the
cea
and
how
the
product
is
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
17
dcms
should
continue
to
have
the
flexibility
to
launch
new
products
that
they
deem
compliant
with
the
cea
including
cea
section
5c
following
their
own
thorough
review
and
analysis
of
such
products
moreover
as
history
has
shown
dcms
have
the
economic
incentive
to
take
the
appropriate
time
effort
and
care
as
a
regulated
registered
entity
to
design
the
contracts
it
lists
for
trading
to
assure
compliance
with
the
cea
and
commission
regulations
including
compliance
with
dcm
core
principle
3
7
to
this
end
we
strongly
believe
that
the
commission
can
meet
statutory
objectives
reflected
in
cea
section
5c
to
ensure
a
dcm
satisfies
its
regulatory
obligations
to
take
the
time
effort
and
care
to
design
the
contracts
they
list
for
trading
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
we
understand
the
need
for
standards
in
filing
to
list
new
products
but
such
standards
should
align
with
the
need
to
allow
registrants
the
flexibility
to
launch
new
products
upon
submitting
the
requisite
certification
the
commissionʼs
broad
definition
of

is
inconsistent
with
legislative
history
and

quite
to
the
contrary
the
commission
concludes
in
the
proposal
that
because
there
are
no
underlying
cash
markets
for
event
contracts
price
forming
information
is
non
existent
or
driven
by
unregulated
information
sources
such
that
the
contracts
may
not
follow
scientifically
reliable
methodologies
this
is
a
rather
extraordinary
conclusion
given
that
the
commission
made
no
effort
to
explain
what
scientific
research
supported
it
and
that
is
a
problem
because
this
is
precisely
what
congress
intended
for
the
commission
to
do
when
justifying
proposed
rules
as
the
proposal
rightfully
recognizes

requires
the
commission
to

considerations

however
instead
of
assessing
the
potential
economic
impact
of
the

broader
economy
the
commission
focuses
its
cost

assessment
on
how
denying

of
contracts
would

benefit
registered
entities
because
they
wouldnʼt
have
to
waste
the
cost
and
effort
of
trying
to
list
them
avoid
situations
in
which
registered

expend

that
seems
to
miss
the
point
of
the
statutory
requirement
to

the

of
the

in

the
commission
wholly
ignores
the
potential
economic
benefits
of

which
will
be
lost

if
they
are

in
our
view
the

not

such
an
important
decision
from

perspective
rather
we
encourage
the

to
work
with

it

the
literature
on
prediction
markets
goes
well
beyond
these
examples
and
the
commission
should
understand
what
it
says
before
making
any
determination
about
the
treatment
of
any
class
of
contracts
within
its
authority
this
would
not
only
help
prevent
mistakes
like
we
believe
would
occur
under
this
proposal
but
also
would
give
the
commission
an
opportunity
to
consider
ways
to
improve
event
contract
market
quality
and
promote
access
to
these
markets
and
the
information
they
generate
by
allowing
economically
incentivized
predictions
to
materialize
in
regulated
markets
and
by
virtue
of
the
results
being
publicly
available
prediction
markets
can
democratize
access
to
information
that
would
otherwise
be
only
available
to
a
subset
of
well
funded
market
participants
these
measures
can
have
pro
competitive
effects
on
the
economy
as
information
does
not
remain
siloed
within
a
single
firm
with
the
resources
to
acquire
accurate
forecasts
on
their
own
account
public
availability
can
thus
create
a
separate
public
benefit
that
accrues
not
only
to
those
who
trade
the
commission
fails
entirely
to
consider
this
in
its
analysis
such
an
approach
would
not
only
be
in
the
public
interest
but
also
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
on
the
inclusion
of
public
interestˮ
provision
in
the
cea
as
the
proposal
explains
the
term
public
interestˮ
is
not
defined
in
the
cea
and
the
commission
has
historically
relied
on
an
economic
purposeˮ
test
such
a
test
based
on
the
expectation
that
a
contract
can
be
used
for
hedging
or
price
discovery
is
the
longstanding
and
appropriate
measure
by
which
public
interest
should
be
determined
the
2010
colloquy
cited
in
the
proposal
in
which
senator
feinstein
asked
about
the
speculative
use
of
contracts
and
which
the
commission
believes
now
motivates
a
different
approach
does
not
change
this
historically
correct
interpretation
in
the
2010
colloquy
senator
feinstein
recognizes
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative
as
opposed
to
a
hedging
or
economic
emphasis

the

states
that

may
trade

contracts
are
most
likely
to
trade

proposal
at

this
statement
is
made
without
any
further
explanation
analysis
or
reference
to
any
source
that
might
justify
such
a
belief
the
proposal
fails
to
recognize
the
number
of
commercial
and
information
based
benefits
of
these
markets
and
worse
is
devoid
of
facts
or
authorities
to
support
such
a
belief
the
commission
is
now
proposing
to
add
three
factors
to
the
determination
of
public
interest
1
the
extent
to
which
the
contract
or
category
of
contracts
would
draw
the
commission
into
areas
outside
of
its
primary
regulatory
remit
2
whether
characteristics
of
the
contract
or
category
of
contacts
may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating
to
the
trading
or
pricing
of
the
contract
and
3
whether
the
contract
or
category
of
contracts
could
result
in
market
participants
profiting
from
harm
to
any
person
or
group
of
persons
proposal
at
48980
it
is
unclear
why
these
factors
are
needed
the
commissionʼs
general
core
principles
regulatory
approach
for
trading
venues
already
promotes
these
goals
for
example
designated
contract
markets
are
required
to
make
information
publicly
available
which
aligns
with
some
of
the
many
public
benefits
of
prediction
markets
on
registered
exchanges
additionally
dcms
have
obligations
as
self
regulatory
organizations
making
them
well
suited
to
establish
and
enforce
standards
that
promote
market
integrity
through
its
surveillance
and
authority
to
investigate
and
deter
abusive
trading
practices
like
fraud
and
manipulation
it
is
also
unclear
why
any
of
the
legislative
history
cited
in
the
proposal
should
change
the
existing
listing
process
or
how
many
of
the
enumerated
activities
that
the
proposal
attempts
to
capture
through
its
broad
definition
of
gaming
nobel
and
pulitzer
prizes
oscars
elections
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
light
of
the
legislative
history
many
of
the
event
contracts
proposed
to
be
prohibited
have
bona
fide
economic
value
beyond
speculation
and
we
disagree
with
the
commision
statement
while
there
may
be
individuals
or
entities
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequences
the
commission
believes
that
any
such
segment
of
individuals
or
entities
is
likely
to
be
narrow
as
compared
to
the
broader
universe
of
market
participants
including
retail
market
participants
who
may
be
able
to
trade
in
an
event
contract
listed
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
and
who
the
commission
believes
are
most
likely
to
trade
such
contract
for
entertainment
purposes
only
i
d
at
48982
to
the
contrary
the
commission
has
made
no
attempt
to
assess
the
potential
economic
consequences
of
the
proposal
outside
of
compliance
implications
instead
the
commission
makes
sweeping
and
unsubstantiated
statements
about
the
speculative
nature
of
event
contracts
suggesting
that
they
would
be
of
little
economic
value
and
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
investors
the
only
reference
to
research
that
we
found
in
the
proposal
is
in
reference
to
the
potential
impact
of
fake
news
reporting
and
potential
manipulation
of
the
contracts
it
could
be
used
to
distort
the
information
underlying
price
formation
in
such
event
i
d
at
48983
we
donʼt
discount
that
fake
newsˮ
and
misinformation
can
distort
market
prices
this
is
true
today
for
all
financial
market
instruments
that
trade
on
regulated
exchanges
and
not
unique
to
any
one
market
including
prediction
markets
and
somewhat
ironically
unlike
with
any
other
market
prediction
markets
are
particularly
well
suited
to
addressing
the
problem
of
fake
news
in
particular
prediction
markets
are
not
static
but
continually
updating
so
if
investors
are
fooled
at
any
one
time
in
the
case
of
the
article
by
a
fake
poll
that
will
be
quickly
corrected
by
the
ongoing
incentives
or
price
discovery
so
the
evidence
the
proposal
cites
is
exactly
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
well
regulated
prediction
market
would
be
good
in
the
long
run
for
the
economy
it
is
also
not
clear
how
confusion
or
risk
will
be
sowed
with
retail
investors
about
events
that
are
often
much
more
easily
understood
than
many
financial
contracts
for
example
it
is
hard
to
argue
that
an
event
contract
on
who
will
win
the
next
presidential
election
or
the
nobel
prize
is
harder
to
understand
than
a
futures
contract
on
corn
moreover
it
is
a
false
premise
for
the
commission
to
say
or
believe
that
other
things
it
could
improperly
signal
to
certain
retail
investors
that
these
contracts
are
instruments
to
be
used
for
investment
purposes
ˮ
when
the
nature
of
the
contracts
are
very
easy
to
understand
and
the
contracts
can
in
fact
be
used
for
investment
purposes
this
is
even
true
for
sporting
events
a
vendor
costs
of
printing
t
shirts
in
anticipation
of
a
team
winning
a
championship
can
be
hedged
by
taking
a
position
in
favor
of
that
teamʼs
loss
summary
we
recommend
in
light
of
the
considerations
we
highlight
in
our
letter
that
the
commission
abandon
the
proposal
rather
than
prohibit
event
contracts
that
involve
gamingˮ
broadly
defined
the
commission
should
promote
responsible
innovation
by
encouraging
certain
types
of
contracts
to
be
made
available
on
registered
futures
exchanges
the
commission
has
authority
and
institutional
expertise
unlike
any
other
regulatory
authority
to
monitor
novel
product
submissions
and
market
operation
including
in
futures
markets
that
have
an
increasing
retail
customer
base
should
the
commission
otherwise
decide
to
move
forward
with
a
rule
we
strongly
urge
the
commission
to
repropose
separate
from
our
belief
that
this
proposal
has
overstepped
the
commissionʼs
statutory
authority
the
commission
has
not
met
its
statutory
obligations
under
to
fully
explain
the
economic
impact
of
prohibiting
this
nascent
market
from
further
developing
doing
so
would
provide
the
public
an
opportunity
to
more
fully
respond
to
the
commissionʼs
thinking
and
logic
behind
such
an
action
which
we
donʼt
currently
believe
is
merited
