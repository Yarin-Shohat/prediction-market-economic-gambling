i
am
writing
to
express
my
opposition
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
proposed
rule
on
event
contracts
this
proposal
as
it
currently
stands
poses
significant
challenges
to
the
development
and
utility
of
event
contracts
particularly
those
related
to
elections
below
i
outline
my
concerns
and
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
approach
hedging
use
cases
event
contracts
especially
those
related
to
elections
provide
essential
tools
for
hedging
against
uncertainties
that
have
profound
impacts
on
policy
the
economy
and
daily
life
elections
can
lead
to
significant
shifts
in
regulatory
and
economic
environments
affecting
businesses
and
individuals
alike
just
as
hedge
funds
utilize
complex
strategies
to
hedge
election
outcomes
main
street
investors
should
also
have
access
to
tools
that
allow
them
to
manage
these
risks
effectively
these
contracts
enable
individuals
and
businesses
to
protect
themselves
against
potential
adverse
effects
of
electoral
outcomes
ensuring
stability
and
informed
decision
making
the
ability
to
hedge
these
risks
is
not
just
a
luxury
for
sophisticated
investors
but
a
necessity
for
all
market
participants
the
current
stance
of
the
cftc
as
reflected
in
its
recent
orders
suggests
that
event
contracts
related
to
elections
do
not
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
due
to
their
binary
nature
and
the
unpredictability
of
election
outcomes
however
this
perspective
overlooks
the
broader
economic
impacts
that
election
results
can
have
affecting
industries
markets
and
individual
financial
positions
market
participants
such
as
media
companies
and
consultancies
may
find
significant
value
in
hedging
against
the
direct
risks
stemming
from
electoral
outcomes
the
cftc
role
should
not
be
to
deny
market
participants
the
choice
of
financial
products
that
meet
their
hedging
needs
simply
because
they
are
deemed
not
effective
enough
by
the
commission
questions
for
the
cftc
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
criteria
does
the
cftc
use
to
determine
the
hedging
utility
of
event
contracts
and
how
does
it
account
for
the
broader
economic
impacts
of
election
outcomes
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
approach
does
not
inadvertently
push
market
participants
towards
unregulated
platforms
thereby
increasing
systemic
risk
3
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
market
participants
to
better
understand
their
hedging
needs
and
the
potential
utility
of
event
contracts
in
meeting
those
needs
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
event
contracts
that
have
been
deemed
to
have
sufficient
hedging
utility
and
explain
the
rationale
behind
these
determinations
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
its
concerns
about
the
commoditization
of
the
electoral
process
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participants
with
legitimate
hedging
tools
by
addressing
these
questions
the
cftc
can
provide
greater
clarity
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
supports
a
balanced
and
effective
market
environment
without
unnecessarily
restricting
beneficial
trading
activities
it
is
crucial
that
the
commission
recognizes
the
importance
of
these
markets
in
providing
essential
hedging
tools
and
considers
how
they
can
be
regulated
to
maximize
their
utility
while
ensuring
transparency
security
and
compliance
legal
and
regulated
markets
the
existence
of
event
contracts
on
unregulated
platforms
like
polymarket
highlights
a
critical
gap
in
customer
protection
and
market
integrity
it
is
paradoxical
that
such
markets
can
operate
without
oversight
while
regulated
exchanges
which
have
systems
in
place
for
customer
protection
kyc
know
your
customer
surveillance
and
aml
anti
money
laundering
are
restricted
from
offering
these
contracts
the
cftc
should
focus
on
regulating
these
markets
to
ensure
they
operate
within
a
legal
framework
rather
than
pushing
them
to
unregulated
environments
that
lack
necessary
safeguards
regulated
exchanges
are
equipped
with
robust
mechanisms
to
protect
market
participants
and
ensure
fair
trading
practices
by
prohibiting
event
contracts
on
these
platforms
the
cftc
inadvertently
encourages
the
growth
of
unregulated
markets
where
participants
are
exposed
to
higher
risks
of
fraud
manipulation
and
lack
of
recourse
in
case
of
disputes
this
approach
undermines
the
cftc
mission
to
ensure
market
integrity
and
protect
consumers
instead
the
commission
should
leverage
its
regulatory
expertise
to
establish
guidelines
that
allow
event
contracts
to
be
traded
safely
and
transparently
on
regulated
exchanges
questions
for
the
cftc
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
measures
does
the
cftc
plan
to
implement
to
ensure
that
event
contracts
can
be
offered
on
regulated
exchanges
with
appropriate
customer
protection
and
market
integrity
safeguards
2
how
does
the
cftc
justify
the
prohibition
of
event
contracts
on
regulated
platforms
while
allowing
their
existence
on
unregulated
markets
which
lack
essential
oversight
mechanisms
3
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
stakeholders
including
exchanges
and
market
participants
to
develop
a
regulatory
framework
that
supports
the
safe
and
legal
trading
of
event
contracts
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
successful
regulatory
frameworks
from
other
jurisdictions
that
have
effectively
managed
the
risks
associated
with
event
contracts
while
ensuring
customer
protection
5
how
will
the
cftc
balance
its
concerns
about
the
potential
misuse
of
event
contracts
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participants
with
legitimate
and
regulated
avenues
for
trading
these
instruments
forecasting
and
data
prediction
markets
generate
data
that
is
invaluable
and
often
more
accurate
than
traditional
polling
methods
numerous
studies
have
shown
that
these
markets
offer
unbiased
and
reliable
forecasts
making
them
a
superior
tool
for
anticipating
future
events
the
market
based
price
discovery
they
provide
is
crucial
for
businesses
and
individuals
relying
on
accurate
forecasts
to
make
informed
decisions
by
restricting
event
contracts
the
cftc
limits
access
to
this
valuable
data
which
could
enhance
decision
making
processes
across
various
sectors
instead
of
banning
these
markets
the
cftc
should
welcome
this
innovation
and
find
ways
to
regulate
them
effectively
ensuring
their
utility
for
all
participants
prediction
markets
have
consistently
demonstrated
their
ability
to
aggregate
diverse
information
and
opinions
into
a
single
market
based
forecast
that
often
surpasses
the
accuracy
of
conventional
methods
like
opinion
polls
the
mechanism
of
trading
contracts
based
on
the
likelihood
of
future
events
creates
a
financial
incentive
for
participants
to
leverage
all
available
information
resulting
in
a
more
accurate
and
unbiased
forecast
this
is
particularly
valuable
in
areas
such
as
elections
where
traditional
polling
can
be
subject
to
biases
and
inaccuracies
the
insights
gained
from
prediction
markets
can
inform
strategic
decisions
in
business
policy
making
and
risk
management
providing
a
competitive
edge
to
those
who
utilize
this
data
effectively
questions
for
the
cftc
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
evidence
does
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
position
that
prediction
markets
do
not
provide
valuable
and
reliable
data
and
how
does
this
compare
to
the
extensive
research
demonstrating
their
forecasting
accuracy
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
balance
its
concerns
about
speculation
and
market
manipulation
with
the
need
to
provide
market
participants
access
to
high
quality
market
based
data
3
what
regulatory
measures
can
the
cftc
implement
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
prediction
markets
while
allowing
them
to
operate
and
provide
valuable
data
to
businesses
and
individuals
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
successful
regulatory
frameworks
from
other
jurisdictions
that
have
effectively
managed
the
risks
associated
with
prediction
markets
5
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
engage
with
academic
researchers
and
industry
experts
to
better
understand
the
value
and
potential
of
prediction
markets
in
providing
accurate
forecasts
invalid
cftc
arguments
the
cftc
arguments
against
election
markets
lack
empirical
support
and
are
based
on
broad
assertions
rather
than
concrete
data
the
claim
that
these
markets
pose
a
threat
to
democracy
is
not
substantiated
by
any
rigorous
analysis
or
evidence
such
sweeping
statements
do
not
provide
a
valid
basis
for
a
blanket
ban
on
event
contracts
the
cftc
reluctance
to
act
as
an
election
cop
does
not
justify
restricting
a
market
that
could
provide
valuable
tools
for
hedging
and
forecasting
instead
of
prohibiting
these
markets
outright
the
cftc
should
engage
in
the
hard
work
of
developing
a
regulatory
framework
that
addresses
its
concerns
while
allowing
these
markets
to
operate
the
assertion
that
allowing
event
contracts
would
commoditize
the
electoral
process
overlooks
the
potential
benefits
of
a
regulated
market
by
creating
a
legal
and
transparent
environment
for
trading
these
contracts
the
cftc
could
mitigate
risks
associated
with
unregulated
platforms
ensuring
consumer
protection
and
market
integrity
a
ban
is
a
simplistic
solution
that
fails
to
recognize
the
complexities
of
the
issue
and
the
potential
for
innovation
within
a
regulated
framework
moreover
the
cftc
has
not
adequately
considered
the
broader
implications
of
its
proposed
ban
by
restricting
event
contracts
the
commission
risks
pushing
market
participants
toward
unregulated
platforms
where
oversight
and
consumer
protections
are
minimal
this
could
lead
to
increased
risks
of
fraud
and
manipulation
ultimately
undermining
the
very
integrity
the
cftc
seeks
to
protect
questions
for
the
cftc
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
what
specific
empirical
evidence
does
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
assertion
that
election
markets
pose
a
threat
to
democracy
2
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
differentiate
between
legitimate
market
activities
that
provide
valuable
hedging
and
forecasting
tools
and
those
that
may
be
deemed
harmful
or
speculative
3
what
steps
will
the
cftc
take
to
ensure
that
its
regulatory
framework
allows
for
innovation
and
the
development
of
event
contracts
while
addressing
concerns
about
potential
market
manipulation
4
can
the
cftc
provide
examples
of
other
markets
or
sectors
where
it
has
successfully
implemented
regulations
that
balance
consumer
protection
with
the
promotion
of
market
innovation
5
how
will
the
cftc
engage
with
stakeholders
including
market
participants
and
researchers
to
gather
input
on
the
potential
benefits
and
risks
associated
with
event
contracts
before
finalizing
its
rule
flawed
process
the
process
leading
to
this
proposed
rule
has
been
flawed
the
cftc
is
currently
involved
in
two
lawsuits
related
to
topics
closely
associated
with
the
rule
and
the
courts
have
not
yet
made
a
final
decision
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
cftc
to
propose
a
rule
while
the
legal
framework
is
still
being
determined
furthermore
the
cftc
has
not
engaged
adequately
with
stakeholders
or
the
industry
rushing
the
rulemaking
process
without
fully
understanding
the
benefits
of
these
markets
and
their
broad
public
interest
implications
given
these
concerns
i
urge
the
cftc
to
address
the
following
questions
1
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
accommodate
the
legitimate
hedging
needs
of
businesses
and
individuals
if
event
contracts
are
prohibited
2
what
specific
evidence
does
the
cftc
have
to
support
its
position
that
prediction

do
not
provide
valuable

and
how
does
this
