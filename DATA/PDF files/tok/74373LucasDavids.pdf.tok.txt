former
senator
blanche
lincoln
recently
expressed
her
deep
concern
over
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
certain
categories
of
contracts
including
election
markets
by
referencing
a
2010
colloquy
between
herself
and
the
late
senator
dianne
feinstein
she
emphasized
that
the
cftc
interpretation
of
this
colloquy
goes
beyond
what
was
intended
senator
lincoln
highlighted
that
the
proposal
to
ban
markets
outright
rather
than
regulate
them
risks
undermining
the
core
principles
that
underpin
our
financial
markets
these
principles
include
fostering
innovation
and
providing
consumer
protections
which
were
central
to
the
legislation
she
helped
craft
i
agree
with
senator
lincoln
perspective
and
believe
it
is
crucial
for
the
cftc
to
focus
on
regulation
rather
than
prohibition
proper
regulation
can
ensure
that
prediction
markets
operate
transparently
and
ethically
providing
valuable
insights
and
hedging
opportunities
without
resorting
to
unregulated
offshore
platforms
by
encouraging
innovation
within
a
structured
regulatory
framework
the
cftc
can
uphold
the
integrity
of
the
markets
while
protecting
consumers
and
promoting
economic
growth
the
focus
should
be
on
creating
a
balanced
approach
that
aligns
with
the
original
legislative
intent
to
prevent
gambling
while
fostering
legitimate
economic
uses
