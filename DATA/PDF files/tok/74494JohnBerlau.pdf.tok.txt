which
concerns
the
types
of

would
like
to
acknowledge
the
invaluable
assistance
in

these
comments
of
cei

associate
ari
patinkin
under
the
proposed
rule
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
would
among
other
sweeping
actions
ban
event
contracts
that
allow
americans
to
wager
on
the
outcome
of
elections
and
other
political
events
cei
believes
that
such
an
action
put
forth
by
this
rule
would
be
contrary
to
the
interests
of
entrepreneurs
investors
and
an
informed
electorate
of
voters
collectively
the
public
interest
and
that
the
cftc
furthermore
lacks
authority
from
congress
to
implement
such
a
rule
accordingly
the
rule
should
be
withdrawn

a

committed
to
advancing
the
principles
of

cei
has
a
longstanding
interest
in
applying
these
principles
to
the
rulemaking
process
and
has
frequently
commented
on
issues
related
to
oversight

the

advance
the
freedom

for
american
consumers

striving
for
a
better

for

and
their

we
also
believe
american

should
be
allowed
to
make
choices
in
the
marketplace
weighing
the
costs
and
benefits
of
these
choices
without
overreaching

bureaucracies

cei
also
pursues
public

litigation
on

to
ensure
that

to
ensure
that

act
within
the
constraints
of

w
e
are
particularly
concerned
with
what
we
call
regulation
without
representation
the
process
of
laws
effectively
being
made
by
unelected
regulatory
agencies
instead
of
the
people
representatives
in

expressed
the
sentiment
ahead
of
the
vote
that
the
cftc
should
not
allow
products
in
our
markets
with
an
unacceptable
risk
of
unchecked
abuse
and
manipulation
that
could
threaten
the

of

yet
as
my
colleague
ari
patinkin
and
i
recently
wrote
in
national
review
in
issuing
this
rule
it
is
the
cftc
that
has
revealed
itself
to
be
the
true
threat
to
the
democratic
process
as
it
is
exceeding
the
authority
it
has
been
given
by
the
nation
elected
representatives
in
the
proposed
rule
the
cftc
cites
no
directive
from

allowing
it
to
categorically
ban

there
is
none

in
formulating
this
rule
cftc
interprets
broadly
a
provision
of
the
2010
dodd
frank
act
that
permits
the
regulator
to
ban
contracts
related
to
gaming
in
the
text
of
the
proposed
rule
the
cftc
makes
the
threestep
argument
that
elections
are
contests
all
contests
are
games
and
therefore
contracts
on
election
outcomes
involve
gaming
and
may
be
banned
under
the
statute
in
other
words
to
justify
giving
itself
this
new
authority
to
ban
event
contracts
related
to
elections
the
cftc
classifies
elections
which
chair
benham
and
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
had
said
were
sacrosanct
in
supporting
this
rule
as
simply
a
bunch
of
games
under
the
law
cftc
commissioner
caroline
pham
blasts
this
tortured
reasoning
as
stunning
overreach
in
her
statement
preceding
her
dissenting
vote
on
the
rule
she
adds
that
rule
would
also
harm
federalism
in
that
it
bigfoots
into
gaming
regulation
that
has
traditionally
been
the
prerogatives
of
states

chair
benham
and
commissioner
goldsmith
romero
may
have
sincere
convictions
against
betting
markets
but
without
the
explicit
authorization
of
congress
the
cftc
can
not
simply
implement
a
rule
based
on
the
conviction
no
matter
how
sincerely
held
that
a
private
sector
activity
is
immoral
or
even
corrupting
to
do
so
bypassing
the
voters
elected
representatives
in
congress
would
be
fundamentally
undemocratic
the
cftc
should
also
note
that
since
it
proposed
this
rule
in
may
the
supreme
court
has
changed
significantly
the
legal
landscapes
for
agencies
offering
novel
interpretations
statutes
to
justify
new
authority
in
loper
bright
raimondo
the
court
jettisoned
the
chevron
deference
precedent
that
largely
defers
to
regulatory
agencies
interpretation
of
the
powers
granted
to
them
by
law
and
it
admonished
lower
courts
to
be
skeptical
of
agencies
interpretations
of
authority
not
expressly
given
to
by
congress
to
borrow
the
terminology
of
the
wagering
industries
that
this
rule
concerns
any
banking
the
cftc
made
on
judicial
deference
in
formulating
this
rule
may
have
been
a
bad
bet
prediction
markets
including
on
elections
have
received
bipartisan
scholarly
praise
beyond
the
issues
of
regulation
without
representation
cei
believes
this
rule
is
fundamentally
flawed
because
it
curtails
americans
access
to
an
innovation
that
scholars
of
markets
and
politics
across
ideological
lines
say
is
beneficial
to
entrepreneurs
investors
policymakers
and
an
informed
citizenry
election

referred

essential
roles
in
providing
information
to

and
policymakers
about
the
likelihood
of
election
results

that
during
this

season
prediction
markets
are
probably
the
more
useful
tool
because
political

have
been
