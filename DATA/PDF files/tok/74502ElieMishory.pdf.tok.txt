clayton
yeutter
good
morning
and
thank
you
for
inviting
me
to
address
this
group
last
year
when
i
talked
to
you
at
the
scia
annual
meeting
in
burgenstock
i
told
you
of
the
dynamic
growth
the
futures
industry
was
undergoing
i
am
happy
to
report
that
that
growth
continued
in
1983
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
had
its
seventh
consecutive
record
breaking
year
topping
1982
trading
volume
by
more
than
13
per
cent
since
1972
we
have
seen
our
annual
volume
grow
from
million
contracts
to
million
contracts
a
truly
phenomenal
record
i
also
told
you
about
an
exciting
new
futures
instrument
that
has
paced
our
growth
the
standard
and
poor
500
stock
index
futures
we
now
have
a
family
of
stock
index
products
which
includes
500
futures
being
used
by
more
and
more
institutional
investors
1
100
futures
aimed
primarily
at
the
individual
investor
and
500
options
which
gives
institutional
users
the
chance
to
choose
between
options
and
futures
contracts
for
ri
sk
protection
we
will
soon
add
an
energy
sub
index
and
other
sub
indices
later
giving
our
exchange
an
extensive
range
of
these
valuable
new
investment
tools
our
products
now
account
for
nearly
70
per
cent
of
industry
wide
stock
index
volume
in
less
than
two
years
500
futures
have
become
one
of
five
most
heavily
used
futures
products
and
volume
continues
to
grow
astronomically
it
typically
takes
about
four
years
before
a
futures
instrument
reaches
an
annual
volume
of
three
million
contracts
with
the
500
in
april
1982
clayton
yeutter
is
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
he
is
a
former
assistant
secretary
of
agriculture
and
served
as
deputy
special
trade
representative
during
the
ford
administration
for
the
first
full
year
was
more
than
eight
million
contracts
clearly
stock
index
instruments
are
one
of
this
industry
all
time
success
stories
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
today
if
i
were
to
describe
this
new
investment
tool
in
more
detail
and
tell
you
how
it
is
being
used
to
investment
risk
each
day
we
hear
reports
of
other
futures
exchanges
around
the
world
who
plan
to
introduce
stock
index
futures
here
in
europe
in
the
far
east
and
even
in
latin
america
though
these
proposed
new
contracts
are
destined
to
spread
stock
index
futures
worldwide
i
must
confess
that
futures
contracts
are
probably
the
most
misunderstood
of
all
financial
instruments
the
stereotype
of
a
futures
exchange
is
a
marketplace
where
only
speculation
occurs
and
wild
eyed
gamblers
drive
prices
up
and
down
nothing
could
be
more
fallacious
futures
markets
do
not
create
risk
they
merely
transfer
it
from
investors
businessmen
agricultural
producers
and
bankers
to
professional
traders
who
are
willing
to
accept
that
risk
in
the
hope
of
making
substantial
profits
this
is
the
vital
economic
function
of
futures
market
it
is
what
they
are
all
about
until
1972
this
transferral
of
risk
was
available
only
in
the
agricultural
sector
but
in
that
year
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
launched
the
era
of
financial
futures
with
trading
in
the
international
currencies
as
a
consequence
it
is
now
possible
to
transfer
interest
rate
risk
exchange
rate
risk
and
with
stock
index
futures
stock
portfolio
risk
to
those
willing
to
accept
it
with
the
advent
of
enormous
stock
price
volatility
in
the
19706
the
vulnerability
of
institutional
portfolios
became
quite
apparent
to
investment
managers
this
made
the
500
especially
attractive
when
it
became
available
in
less
than
two
years
futures
have
become
a
major
new
tool
in
equity
portfolio
management
the
marketplace
is
still
the
best
proving
ground
for
a
new
product
so
let
look
at
some
of
the
users
of
these
instruments
and
the
strategies
they
have
developed
several
large
corporate
pension
funds
including
exxon
and
westinghouse
electric
use
stock
index
futures
as
hedging
vehicles
harvard
university
uses
them
in
the
management
of
the
various
funds
it
controls
the
university
has
found
that
it
can
reduce
the
market
risk
associated
with
large
endowments
and
increase
the
rate
of
return
on
its
investments
the
prudential
insurance
company
uses
stock
index
futures
in
the
management
of
the
prudential
bache
option
growth
fund
travelers
insurance
and
citibank
use
stock
index
futures
to
assist
in
the
market
timing
of
their
investment
funds
let
walk
through
a
hypothetical
case
where
a
multinational
corporation
wants
to
use
stock
index
futures
to
hedge
its
stock
portfolio
let
us
say
that
the
corporation
has
a
two
million
dollar
diversified
portfolio
of
stocks
that
correlates
closely
with
the
general
market
the
portfolio
manager
believes
the
market
may
be
vulnerable
to
a
decline
and
wishes
to
protect
himself
without
having
to
sell
individual
securities
when
the
500
index
is
priced
at
he
decides
to
hedge
two
thirds
of
his
portfolio
by
selling
seventeen
500
futures
contracts
which
are
trading
at
when
the
index
then
falls
from
to
and
the
futures
contract
falls
from
to
he
will
close
out
his
position
by
hedging
he
has
limited
the
decline
in
his
portfolio
value
to
percent
had
he
not
hedged
the
decline
would
have
been
percent
and
had
he
decided
to
hedge
his
entire
portfolio
instead
of
two
thirds
his
decline
would
have
been
totally
eliminated
in
fact
he
would
have
profited
by
of
course
there
are
a
number
of
other
strategies
that
can
be
developed
around
stock
index
futures
for
example
they
can
be
used
to
shift
the
mix
of
an
equity
portfolio
they
can
be
employed
to
capture
a
risk
free
return
while
holding
on
to
equities
the
cme
marketing
department
constantly
hears
of
new
strategies
that
the
marketplace
has
devised
for
these
contracts
remember
that
i
referred
earlier
to
the
popular
misconception
that
futures
markets
are
gambling
dens
populated
only
by
speculators
now
obviously
the
speculator
is
a
very
important
part
of
the
market
without
the
speculator
whether
he
be
a
floor
trader
or
an
outside
customer
the
markets
would
have
no
liquidity
without
liquidity
the
markets
would
dry
up
and
disappear
so
the
speculator
is
important
but
when
you
consider
what
just
been
telling
you
about
large
institutional
use
of
our
markets
and
the
investment
strategies
that
have
been
developed
you
realize
that
there
are
numerous
legitimate
hedging
applications
for
futures
markets
typically
when
we
introduce
a
new
contract
the
market
is
first
used
by
block
traders
and
the
speculator
until
volume
builds
to
a
certain
level
then
as
banks
corporations
portfolio
managers
investors
and
other
market
participants
learn
how
to
use
the
new
contract
the
hedger
comes
in
only
then
does
a
market
take
off
the
way
the
500
has
off
for
example
obviously
we
see
a
bright
future
for
stock
index
products
500
futures
could
soon
be
the
number
one
futures
contract
in
our
industry
the
100
is
doing
well
and
500
options
seem
ready
to
advance
to
higher
trading
levels
and
new
sub
indices
will
permit
investors
a
much
wider
range
of
strategies
that
the
beauty
of
stock
index
products
as
we
launch
new
products
we
bring
new
business
to
all
the
other
members
of
the
index
and
option
if
one
looks
at
the
number
of
potential
users
of
stock
index
futures
the
necessary
conclusion
is
that
potential
growth
is
virtually
unlimited
some
studies
indicate
that
there
are
about
persons
who
actively
use
futures
markets
this
compares
to
about
35
million
persons
who
hold
securities
stock
indexes
obviously
are
a
revolutionary
new
product
that
will
continue
to
spur
growth
in
futures
markets
for
many
years
to
come
certainly
we
at
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
see
these
and
other
index
futures
as
a
strong
factor
in
our
ongoing
plans
for
the
years
ahead
