to
those
it
may
concern
i
writing
today
for
mage
mage
has
created
an
open
source
tool
for
building
and
running
data
pipelines
that
transform
data
our
goal
is
to
make
data
intensive
work
easier
for
data
scientists
an
increasingly
in
demand
service
across
myriad
industries
and
sectors
the
commission
should
approve
kalshiex
contract
for
listing
which
would
create
an
important
tool
for
the
public
media
and
private
businesses
to
manage
and
study
electoral
and
political
risk
prediction
markets
are
useful
tools
for
solving
all
sorts
of
problems
by
having
individuals
put
money
on
the
line
getting
skin
in
the
game
markets
can
efficiently
aggregate
unbelievably
large
amounts
of
information
into
a
single
price
that
price
incorporates
all
possible
sources
of
data
on
election
probabilities
polls
and
their
varying
quality
and
house
effects
fundraising
past
election
outcomes
expert
forecasts
news
events
and
more
the
totality
of
the
market
view
means
more
than
any
one
individual
this
information
is
also
critical
to
pricing
other
assets
equity
prices
for
example
depend
on
expectations
regarding
policy
notably
of
the
corporate
tax
rate
regulation
and
government
subsidies
this
is
a
finding
that
has
been
repeatedly
falsified
by
academic
research
such
as
that
of
wolfers
and
zitzewitz
or
jayachandran
the
jeffords
effect
it
why
so
many
economists
have
supported
kalshiex
proposal
and
supported
nadex
before
that
we
think
kalshiex
congressional
control
contract
along
with
other
prediction
markets
would
be
in
the
public
interest
