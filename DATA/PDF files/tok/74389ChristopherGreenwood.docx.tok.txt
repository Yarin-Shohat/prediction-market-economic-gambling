dear
chairman
and
commissioners
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
i
am
a
retired
union
stagehand
who
consistently
lost
money
in
the
stock
market
i
had
to
give
up
sports
betting
because
i
consistently
lost
at
that
too
both
of
those
attempts
to
supplement
my
small
fixed
retirement
income
wound
up
being
drains
on
my
income
and
my
family
and
then
i
discovered
prediction
markets
i
found
that
my
knowledge
of
politics
and
probabilities
were
actual
assets
that
i
could
use
to
make
money
i
found
that
my
critical
thinking
skills
and
the
ability
to
learn
quickly
were
even
more
valuable
than
i
had
ever
dreamed
i
found
that
when
i
was
able
to
keep
my
bias
in
check
i
could
profit
from
those
who
could
not
i
found
that
when
i
did
understand
something
i
could
learn
about
it
and
be
rewarded
for
that
learning
unlike
sports
betting
casino
gambling
or
even
investing
in
the
stock
market
i
felt
as
if
i
was
providing
a
public
service
by
predicting
election
outcomes
and
polling
averages
even
climate
change
and
economic
indicators
prediction
markets
have
been
proven
to
aggregate
large
swaths
of
data
and
make
accurate
predictions
that
are
much
more
useful
to
the
economy
and
the
world
than
predicting
who
will
for
example
win
the
super
bowl
i
was
a
superforecaster
at
the
good
judgement
project
where
our
predictions
regularly
wound
up
on
the
desks
of
the
president
senators
and
many
other
members
of
the
us
government
who
found
our
predictions
to
be
a
valuable
tool
i
was
a
forecaster
at
intrade
where
we
accurately
predicted
several
elections
and
even
managed
to
keep
predictions
accurate
when
millions
of
dollars
were
coming
in
on
what
would
prove
to
be
the
losing
side
those
markets
worked
well
despite
the
attempts
by
some
very
wealthy
people
to
paint
a
narrative
by
manipulating
those
markets
those
of
us
who
saw
that
one
side
was
attempting
to
influence
prices
to
influence
the
media
narrative
and
thereby
the
election
outcome
knew
exactly
what
was
happening
and
profited
from
it
we
were
the
poster
children
of
efficient
market
theory
i
have
been
predicting
elections
and
polling
averages
at
predictit
since
its
founding
and
have
become
an
expert
on
making
those
markets
more
efficient
using
linked
margin
in
what
kalshi
refers
to
as
mutually
exclusive
groups
i
appeared
on
multiple
podcasts
to
help
people
understand
these
methods
of
creating
liquidity
and
efficiency
in
these
markets
my
years
of
work
in
this
area
have
proven
quite
profitable
and
helped
me
in
retirement
by
providing
regular
income
for
my
efforts
i
work
with
a
team
of
people
who
have
all
become
amazingly
good
at
what
we
do
the
efficiency
and
accuracy
of
the
markets
at
predicit
are
a
testament
to
the
good
work
we
and
many
others
have
done
and
it
a
shame
that
all
that
hard
work
could
be
meaningless
now
in
a
world
where
anyone
with
a
phone
can
bet
on
a
football
game
but
those
of
us
who
actually
invest
in
futures
that
help
scientists
economists
and
politicians
create
a
better
world
more
accurately
based
on
facts
and
implied
probabilities
will
be
left
with
no
place
to
use
our
talents
and
skills
since
kalshi
has
moved
into
the
prediction
market
arena
i
discovered
that
i
can
use
their
site
to
hedge
economic
risks
to
me
such
as
inflation
interest
rates
and
even
recessions
even
better
i
discovered
that
the
large
institutions
to
whom
i
likely
lost
money
when
i
was
investing
in
stocks
and
bonds
are
hedging
on
these
economic
indicators
like
inflation
and
they
often
distort
prices
away
from
what
is
the
likely
reality
offering
me
excellent
expected
values
that
have
proven
quite
profitable
the
same
reasoning
behind
having
prediction
markets
that
allow
wall
street
to
hedge
against
risk
in
economic
indicators
such
as
inflation
gdp
and
interest
rates
apply
even
more
to
elections
because
much
of
what
happens
economically
is
directly
related
to
political
power
prediction
markets
on
who
will
have
that
power
provide
two
extremely
beneficial
effects
hedging
against
the
risk
of
political
change
and
accurately
predicting
future
events
that
have
an
outsized
impact
on
economics
i
especially
interested
in
predicting
climate
change
something
with
the
potential
to
greatly
upset
economic
markets
all
over
the
world
i
would
relish
the
chance
to
invest
in
more
markets
that
predict
the
long
term
impacts
of
climate
change
from
polar
ice
caps
melting
to
global
temperatures
from
sea
level
rise
to
freshwater
reservoir
demise
by
investing
in
a
future
where
climate
change
impacts
are
much
worse
than
they
are
now
i
can
create
wealth
to
help
my
family
deal
with
those
impacts
and
since
what
we
americans
do
about
climate
change
is
highly
dependent
on
electoral
outcomes
i
would
relish
the
ability
to
minimize
the
risks
my
family
might
face
in
this
climate
emergency
future
by
investing
in
the
political
futures
i
see
coming
in
the
more
immediate
political
future
the
hedging
benefits
are
obvious
since
i
no
longer
employed
through
my
union
my
wife
no
longer
has
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seems
that
republicans
are
likely
to
take
control
i
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premiums
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
smaller
or
that
her
ability
to
purchase
insurance
at
all
is
taken
away
completely
but
even
in
markets
where
i
am
not
hedging
risk
i
am
still
providing
a
valuable
service
by
making
the
markets
more
liquid
and
more
predictive
i
learned
valuable
skills
in
market
making
and
liquidity
providing
that
provide
me
with
a
regular
income
while
i
making
the
markets
more
efficient
and
predictive
in
many
cases
especially
with
linked
markets
or
mutually
exclusive
groups
as
i
mentioned
above
i
been
able
to
make
money
with
little
or
even
no
risk
to
myself
these
kinds
of
arbitrage
opportunities
just
are
realistically
possible
for
small
investors
in
big
markets
like
the
stock
market
and
they
do
exist
at
all
in
the
gaming
world
of
sports
and
casino
gambling
i
hope
for
all
our
sakes
and
especially
for
the
sake
of
my
granddaughter
that
the
cftc
embraces
this
innovative
and
beneficial
possibility
for
kalshi
to
provide
election
markets
so
that
we
can
live
in
a
world
where
facts
logic
and
reason
are
still
valuable
commodities
that
one
can
use
to
create
value
thank
you
