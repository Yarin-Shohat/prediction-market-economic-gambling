not
supported
by

the
only
consistent
coherent
interpretation
of
the

is
that
the

read
in
its
statutory

links
the

in
the

to
a

not
to

this

what

is
the

they
relate

or

such
activity
no
matter
how
broad
a
single
statutory
term
in
a
single
sentence
can
not
perform
two
completely
different
tasks
simultaneously
the
commission
proposal
attempts
to
turn
the
word
involve
into
a
shapeless
adaptive
and
subjective
creation
is
incredulous
it
is
utterly
implausible
that

through
a
single
word
repeatedly
shifted
the
focal
point
of
a
crucial
statutory
inquiry
back
and
forth
across
five
subparagraphs
of
the

this
impassable
obstacle
to
the

interpretation
of
the

is
referred
to
as
the

statutory

have
fixed

they
do
not

to
fit
particular
applications
in
an
attempt
to
move
the
goalposts
the
proposal
attempts
to
wave
its
hands
at
the
definition
of
the
term
involves
to
include
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely

none

none

no
matter
which

is
used
to
define

the

what

the

analysis

depending
on
which
object
it
is
modifying
the
proposal
position
on
the
only
relevant
part
of
this
analysis
is
that
the
term
involve
encompasses
both
event
contracts
whose
underlying
is
an

and
event

with

because

they
relate

exposed
to
its
simplicity
the
work
performed
by
the
term
involve
according
to
the
commission
reading
is
not
consistent
across
the
statute
try
as
it
might
the
commission
can
not
escape
that
inconsistency
again
even
accepting
that
involve
means
relate
to
or
entail
it
would
be
bizarre
for
congress
to
switch
back
and
forth
between
two
fundamentally
different
inquiries
in
rapid
succession
asking
first
whether
trading
the
contract
entails
unlawful
activity
then
whether
the
contract
underlying
event
entails
terrorism
assassination
or
war
then
reverting
to
inquire
whether
trading
the
contract
entails
gaming
the
commission
identifies
no
statutory
term
that
has
ever
been
construed
that
way
it
suggests
there
is
no
problem
under
the
consistent
meaning
canon
because
in
its
view
involve
consistently
performs
one
of
two
possible
tasks
either
the
contract
underlying
is
one
of
the
statutory
activities
or
the
contract
has
a
different
connection
with
the
enumerated
activity
but
that
semantic
maneuver
would
render
the
canon
meaningless
as
any
english
speaker
understands
defining
a
term
to
mean
x
or
y
assigns
it
two
meanings
not
one
as
an
unnecessary
illustration
of
the
absurdity
of
the
commission
proposal
consider
a
hypothetical
where
a
theater
policy
requires
parents
to
accompany
minor
children
to
any
screening
that
involves
violence
or
drug
use
in
context
that
policy
clearly
uses
the
word
involve
to
refer
to
the
film
content
not
to
the
behavior
of
attendees
even
though
it
is
semantically
possible
for
the
act
of
attending
the
screening
to
involve
the
listed
activities
now
suppose
the
policy
also
lists
horror
and
science
fiction
alongside
violence
and
drug
use
those
additional
objects
of
involve
place
the
policy
focus
beyond
doubt
because
it
is
not
semantically
possible
for
the
act
of
attending
a
screening
to
entail
science
fiction
or
horror
as
a
result
involve
can
only
refer
to
the
underlying
film
across
all
four
categories
no
reasonable
person
would
understand
it
to
refer
to
the
film
content
with
respect
to
science
fiction
and
horror
but
to
the
attendees
behavior
with
respect
to
violence
and
drug
use
nor
would
anyone
call
that
odd
construction
consistent
while
the
definition
of
involve
is
unchanged
the
word
would
perform
two
very
different
tasks
the
commission
reading
of
the
cea
fails
for
the
same
reason
the
proposal
also
ignores
the
canon
of
statutory
interpretation
called
statutory
context
context
underscores
the
commission
error
because
its
interpretation
would
reduce
multiple
statutory
terms
to
surplusage
and
unwind
the
code
to
revive
a
sweeping
pre
clearance
regime
that
congress
repealed
the
commission
construction
of
involve
ultimately
requires
two
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
unlawful
activity
to
swallow
their
neighbors
and
to
upset
the
statute
basic
structure
whereby
event
contracts
are
subject
to
public
interest
review
only
in
narrowly
defined
circumstances
start
with

of
the
specific
definition

the

will
be
discussed
at
length
below
construing

the
problem
with
the

comes
to

because
multiple

already

construing

pre

finding
no
refuge
in
statutory
text
or
construction
the
proposal
turns
to
a
particularly
unreliable
fragment
of
legislative
history
a
short
floor
colloquy
between
two
senators
putting
aside
the
legal
question
of
whether
this
feeble
legislative
history
is
of
any
import
when
the
actual
statute
is
clear
the
colloquy
does
not
actually
support
the
commission
reading
of
the
statute
the
senators
repeatedly
expressed
concerns
about
contracts
contingent
on
certain
events
both
events
that
threaten
our
national
security
such
as
terrorist
and
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
they
never
suggested
that
the
behavior
of
traders
might
be
the
statute
focal
point
and
nothing
in
their
brief
exchange
which
was
likely
added
to
congressional
record
after
the
fact
due
to
the
lack
of
any
video
evidence
of
this
discussion
happening
on
cspan
supports
the
commission
inconsistent
reading
the
only
viable
interpretation
contrary
to
the
contents
of
the
proposal
is
that
the
statute
authorizes
public
interest
review
only
when
a
contract
underlying
event
involves
relates
to
entails
etc
gaming
or
an
unlawful
activity
that
reading
respects
the
statutory
structure
works
with
all
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
affords
each
category
a
clear
and
appropriately
constrained
sweep
it
is
clearly
the
correct
interpretation
ii
the
proposed
rulemaking
definition
of
gaming
is
wildly
incorrect
and
overboard
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
fails
to
meaningfully
clarify
the
term
gaming
as
the
commission
acknowledged
that
it
one
day
must
in
the
adopting
release
of
rule
and
is
far
too
broad
political
event
contracts
should
not
fall
within
the
definition
of
gaming
the
proposal
parroting
the
flawed
analysis
in
the
kalshi
order
includes
elections
in
the
definition
of
gaming
reasoning
that
1
gaming
means
gambling
which
some
statutes
define
to
include
staking
money
on
the
outcome
of
a
game
contest
or
contingent
event
and
2
taking
a
position
in
an
election
contract
would
be
staking
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
that
logic
hinges
on
an
overbroad
interpretation
of
gaming
that
can
not
be
squared
with
ordinary
usage
and
is
flatly
foreclosed
by
statutory
context
as
detailed
below
gaming
ordinarily
means
playing
games
of
chance
for
money
it
can
also
refer
to
betting
on
games
including
sporting
events
elections
are
not
games
nor
are
they
comparable
in
any
meaningful
way
to
sporting
events
so
event
contracts
contingent
on
elections
can
not
fairly
be
said
to
involve
gaming
as
a
matter
of

is

the
proposition
that

is
a

to

is
truly

that
defining

some
definitions
of
gambling
that
sweep
in
any
and
all
wagers
on
uncertain
contingencies
but
that
approach
treating
gaming
as
a
catchall
for
anything
colloquially
described
as
gambling
or
sweep
every
event
contract
into
this
category
and
it
hard
to
imagine
a
less
reasonable
construction
of
a
single
exception
on
an
enumerated
list
than
one
that
consumes
each
of
its
neighbors
and
the
general
rule
to
boot
this
interpretation
does
not
make
sense
while
the
proposal
tries
to
walk
the
tightrope
here
it
does
make
it
to
start
gaming
is
not
the
same
thing
as
gambling
dictionary
definitions
and
common
legal
usage
alike
confirm
that
gaming
unlike
the
broader
terms
gambling
or
requires
a
predicate
game
to
be
sure
all
gaming
is
a
form
of
gambling
which
is
why
definitions
of
the
former
sometimes
cross
reference
the
latter
but
the
converse
is
not
true
not
all
gambling
is
gaming
congress
chose
the
narrower
term
and
not
the
broader
one
next
conflating
gaming
with
gambling
only
walks
the
commission
into
another
problem
the
ordinary
definition
of
gambling
is
too
broad
to
fit
here
since
it
would
capture
all
contingent
events
the
commission
is
thus
forced
to
gerrymander
a
limited
definition
of
gambling
to
cover
wagers
on
games
or
contests
but
no
other
bets
that
limit
is
artificial
and
unpersuasive
and
untenable
in
context
since
it
would
turn
all
event
contracts
into
gaming
but
as
described
throughout
this
comment
even
a
definition
of
gaming
that
encompasses
wagers
on
contests
but
not
all
wagers
on
contingent
events
fails
for
lack
of
any
support
in
the
cea
or
legislative
history
there
is
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
used
the
word
gaming
in
such
an
idiosyncratic
way
and
the
commission
does
bother
to
supply
one
if
congress
had
intended
to
cover
contracts
on
elections
it
surely
would
have
said
so
more
simply
in
a
rare
bright
spot
unlike
a
comment
of
better
markets
which
fails
at
every
step
of
the
kalshi
order
the
proposal
rightfully
abandons
its
reliance
on
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
which
does
not
use
the
word
gaming
at
all
moreover
the
commission
construction
would
render
superfluous
all
the
other
enumerated
activities
ignoring
the
interpretive
principle
that
every
clause
and
word
of
a
statute
should
have
meaning
and
it
would
grant
the
cftc
a
roving
commission
to
scrutinize
the
social
utility
of
all
event
contracts
a
sweeping
surprising
power
congress
would
not
hide
in
a
single
word
especially
when
that
word
on
its
face
and
based
on
its
legislative
history
appears
to
be
concerned
with
casinos
and
sports
statutory
context
thus
forecloses
the
commission
overbroad
approach
to
gaming
giving
the
term
its
ordinary
meaning
betting
on
games
avoids
all
of
those
pitfalls
the
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
clause
is
unbounded
the
proposal
attempts
to
unobtrusively
expand
the
definition
of
gaming
to
include
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
as
explanation
the
commission
describes
this
particular
clause
as
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
upon
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
and
makes
clear
that
it
is
of
no
import
whether
or
not
such
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
directly
affects
the
outcome
of
a
contest
or
game
this
radically
wide
ranging
definition
is
indefensible
as
it
includes
in
its
ambit
every
potential
occurrence
or
non
occurrences
in
connection
with
a
game
without
any
nexus
to
whether
it
has
any
relevance
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
itself
in
attempting
to
draw
a
line
in
the
water
the
proposal
includes
various
examples
i
whether
a
particular
candidate
enters
or
withdraws
from
a
political
contest
or
polls
above
or
below
a
certain
threshold
ii
whether
a
particular
individual
is
nominated
for
an
award
or
attends
an
award
ceremony
and
iii
in
the
context
of
an
athletic
game
the
score
or
individual
player
or
team
statistics
at
given
intervals
during
the
game
whether
a
particular
player
will
participate
in
a
game
and
whether
a
particular
individual
will
attend
a
game
these
examples
uncover
the
shallowness
of
any
attempted
logical
distinction
and
application
of
the
proposed
definition
according
to
the
cftc
own
examples
whether
a
particular
individual
will
attend
a
game
whether
a
celebrity
attends
the
olympics
or
any
other
sporting
event
should
be
considered
in
connection
with
a
game
and
constitute
gaming
but
whether
that
same
celebrity
attends
the
dnc
or
a
concert
would
not
for
an
event
contract
on
the
attendance
of
a
celebrity
or
any
other
individual
it
should
not
matter
the
nature
of
the
event
that
she
is
attending
consider
the
same
celebrity
attending
a
performance
at
an
arena
on
two
nights
in
a
row
in
the
same
seat
with
the
same
company
the
first
night
is
a
concert
and
the
second
is
an
nba
playoff
game
according
to
the
cftc
own
examples
an
event
contract
on
the
celebrity
first
night
attendance
would
be
benign
but
an
event
contract
on
the
second
night
attendance
would
be
gaming
the
mental
gymnastics
required
to
possibly
contemplate
a
reasonable
difference
in
this
poorly
concocted
proposal
should
earn
an
olympic
gymnastics
medal
but
it
wo
be
done
because
it
ca
be
done
in
the
same
vein
or
seine
the
proposal
would
consider
an
event
contract
on
the
host
city
of
the
next
olympics
would
be
considered
gaming
as
being
in
connection
with
the
olympic
games
but
the
olympic
games
create
a
significant
economic
impact
for
the
potential
host
cities
a
july
18
2024
global
finance
article
describes
the
various
sources
of
revenue
for
the
host
city
including
domestic
sponsorships
ticketing
hospitality
venue
operations
and
the
local
revenue
and
economic
boost
of
tourism
construction
and
the
like
host
cities
also
receive
a
portion
of
the
ioc
revenue
which
the
article
estimates
as
paris
receiving
billion
for
the
2024
olympic
games
and
los
angeles
and
brisbane
slated
to
receive
billion
each
for
the
olympic
games
of
2028
and
2032
with
a
significant
economic
impact
such
as
this
at
stake
it
would
seem
incredulous
to
consider
all
olympic
adjacent
contracts
as
gaming
the
proposal
itself
recognizes
that
this
definition
is
far
beyond
anything
heretofore
seen
in
law
and
regulation
in
introducing
the
four
illustrated
examples
of
the
proposed
definition
the
proposal
states
that
the
first
three
examples
reflect
types
of
games
or
contests
which
have
been
recognized
as
gambling
betting
or
wagering
under
relevant
state
and
federal
statutes
and
would
constitute
gaming
under
the
proposed
definition
as
a
threshold
matter
the
fact
that
the
commission
could
only
find
tangential
statutory
relevance
to
three
out
of
four
examples
it
proposes
to
include
in
the
definition
indicates
that
at
the
very
least
the
fourth
example
is
a
complete
commission
creation
based
on
nothing
more
than
conjecture
the
definition
of
gaming
should
not
include
elections
and
awards
instead
of
the
tortured
reasoning
presented
in
the
proposal
to
expand
the
definition
of
gaming
to
fit
agency
whims
the
commission
should
simply
acknowledge
that
if
congress
had
wanted
to
list
elections
and
awards
as
additional
enumerated
activities
in
the
cea
it
would
have
done
so
congress
could
have
included
elections
and
awards
in
the
list
of
enumerated
activities
in
the
cea
congress
could
have
defined
gaming
to
include
contests
elections
or
awards
but
as
discussed
above
congress
did
neither
of
those
congress
did
not
include
elections
and
awards
in
the
discussion
or
definition
of
gaming
and
the
commission
ca
do
so
on
its
own
either
the
commission
is
fond
of
relying
on
the
2010
colloquy
as
supporting
legislative
history
for
various
aspects
of
the
proposal
although
there
is
much
doubt
about
the
relevance
of
that
colloquy
to
the
substantive
matters
at
hand
as
described
throughout
this
comment
and
countless
others
the
colloquy
is
not
only
unhelpful
to
the
proposal
in
this
instance
but
it
militates
against
the
proposed
definition
for
one
simple
reason
the
entire
discussion
of
the
colloquy
centers
around
examples
of
sporting
events
senator
lincoln
response
to
senator
feinstein
question
about
the
cftc
authority
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
was
that
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
the
proposal
cherry
picks
from
the
colloquy
for
the
proposition
that
senator
lincoln
stated
that
the
provision
was
intended
in
part
to
assure
that
the
commission
had
the
authority
to
prevent
gambling
through
futures
markets
but
this
misses
the
point
and
contorts
it
senator
lincoln
described
sporting
events
as
associated
with
gaming
but
not
elections
or
awards
or
anything
else
that
the
commission
could
imagine
in
fact
in
comment
number
74357
for
this
proposal
former
senator
lincoln
discusses
the
2010
colloquy
at
length
and
writes
as
follows
i
am
deeply
troubled
by
the
recent
proposal
put
forth
by
the
cftc
the
federal
agency
that
is
tasked
with
administering
the
cea
in
prohibiting
broad
categories
of
contracts
the
cftc
proposal
relies
heavily
on
a
2010
senate
colloquy
between
me
and
the
late
senator
feinstein
for
support
but
the
cftc
proposal
goes
well
beyond
what
we
intended
this
heavy
handed
proposal
to
ban
markets
rather
than
regulating
them
risks
undermining
the
core
principles
that
underpin
our
financial
markets
principles
we
strived
to
uphold
through
carefully
crafted
legislation
that
encourages
innovation
and
provides
consumer
protections
however
it
is
my
view
that
the
proposal
interpretation
entirely
misses
the
mark
the
law
was
meant
to
capture
recreational
gambling
on
sporting
events
and
casino
type
activities
not
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
or
the
outcome
of
major
elections
these
events
are
nothing
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
or
the
masters
tournament
if
we
had
intended
to
include
these
events
we
would
have
done
so
explicitly
we
did
not
because
those
events
unlike
the
result
of
a
sports
match
have
real
and
significant
economic
consequences
prohibiting
futures
contracts
on
those
events
would
therefore
inhibit
the
sort
of
legitimate
economic
activity
that
our
markets
are
designed
to
promote
further
it
would
push
this
existing
legal
economic
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
markets
with
little
to
no
consumer
protections
the
proposal
flimsy
reliance
on
an
unsupportive
colloquy
for
a
proposition
that
is
not
addressed
in
that
colloquy
should
be
scrapped
iii
political
event
contracts
are
in
the
public
interest
several
comments
have
raised
concerns
that
allowing
election
contracts
could
create
incentives
to
manipulate
election
outcomes
or
perceptions
undermining
election
integrity
and
that
political
event
contracts
pose
significant
risks
to
public
interest
market
integrity
and
investor
protection
this
is
preposterous
political
event
contracts
are
consistent
with
the
public
interest
in
multiple
ways
first
they
can
consistently
and
reliably
serve
both
of
the
core
public
interest
functions
of
the
derivatives
markets
namely
hedging
against
price
risk
and
enabling
price
discovery
or
price
basing
second
political
event
contracts
would
not
undermine
election
integrity
foster
market
manipulation
or
inappropriately
cast
the
cftc
into
the
role
of
election
regulator
political
event
contracts
serve
a
meaningful
hedging
and
price
discovery
function
as
described
at
length
in
the
various
submissions
to
the
commission
with
regards
to
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
the
kalshi
order
and
again
with
this
proposal
which
the
commission
must
consider
again
election
contracts
serve
a
meaningful
and
undisputed
hedging
and
price
basing
function
businesses
face
a
panoply
of
potential
ways
that
they
can
suffer
harm
that
will
affect
and
impact
their
value
the
value
of
their
services
and
the
value
of
their
assets
these
potential
harms
are
risks
risks
include
valuation
risk
the
value
of
the
business
services
or
asset
decline
funding
risk
access
to
credit
or
other
funding
declines
and
operational
risks
possible
disruptions
or
errors
in
the
production
process
that
undermine
their
earnings
among
many
others
each
one
of
these
general
categories
of
risk
will
manifest
and
impact
each
business
according
to
the
business
unique
activities
profile
composition
etc
and
in
addition
to
these
examples
there
are
many
more
categories
of
risks
including
strategic
risks
getting
outcompeted
by
a
competitor
reputation
risks
liability
risks
and
beyond
there
are
three
steps
that
businesses
generally
follow
when
they
are
managing
the
risk
of
harm
the
first
step
is
to
identify
the
risk
meaning
the
various
places
where
the
business
can
suffer
harm
such
as
negative
movement
in
costs
income
valuations
etc
the
second
step
is
for
the
business
to
assess
how
likely
it
is
that
the
potential
harms
will
materialize
and
how
severe
or
acute
will
the
impacts
of
these
harms
be
in
order
to
do
that
the
business
must
consider
the
factors
that
can
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
the
risks
such
as
by
making
a
harm
more
likely
or
less
likely
to
occur
or
making
a
harm
more
severe
or
less
severe
etc
these
include
market
conditions
and
all
related
factors
that
can
have
a
bearing
on
the
potential
harm
to
illustrate
a
business
might
identify
that
a
decline
in
profit
margin
is
a
harm
that
it
faces
one
of
the
many
factors
that
could
cause
this
harm
is
changes
in
demand
for
its
product
that
will
change
what
it
can
charge
the
business
wo
stop
there
though
it
will
identify
what
trends
or
events
will
create
a
change
in
demand
for
its
product
for
example
the
business
will
consider
what
market
forces
impact
its
core
customer
base
a
slowdown
in
that
sector
might
have
a
corresponding
downward
impact
on
the
demand
for
the
business
product
to
illustrate
consider
a
builder
of
extra
large
river
barges
in
the
upper
midwest
they
know
that
changes
in
demand
impact
their
risk
but
they
need
to
know
what
affects
demand
naturally
they
look
to
key
factors
such
as
lower
grain
yield
in
the
upper
mississippi
river
valley
as
lower
grain
yield
may
mean
lower
need
for
river
barges
both
of
these
are
factors
that
will
impact
the
acuteness
of
the
risk
whether
the
harm
is
likely
to
happen
and
how
severe
it
will
be
if
it
does
happen
as
a
result
they
may
purchase
short
contracts
on
grain
futures
in
order
to
hedge
their
risk
many
businesses
face
potential
harms
that
are
impacted
by
inflation
inflation
can
impact
nearly
all
term
contracts
impacting
the
business
actual
costs
from
the
contracts
for
instance
a
firm
locked
into
a
10
year
commercial
lease
on
their
office
space
will
see
lower
real
costs
as
a
result
of
inflation
than
with
a
shorter
lease
however
if
the
company
is
also
an
intermediate
supplier
and
has
locked
in
their
sales
contracts
they
have
agreed
to
sell
tons
of
dap
di
ammonium
phosphate
fertilizer
at
900
ton
then
the
real
value
of
those
sales
decline
and
inflation
will
harm
them
of
course
inflation
affects
many
other
risks
as
well
higher
inflation
raises
the
probability
that
the
federal
reserve
raises
its
target
interest
rates
which
tends
to
substantially
reduce
stock
valuations
and
the
value
of
assets
inflation
is
just
one
of
many
examples
of
factors
that
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
potential
harms
to
mitigate
those
risks
they
may
seek
to
purchase
any
one
of
many
inflation
hedges
such
as
inflation
swaps
inflation
protected
treasuries
or
inflation
event
contracts
political
control
represents
another
factor
that
could
impact
a
company
risk
profile
much
like
inflation
and
firms
proceed
using
the
same
risk
management
strategy
as
before
a
company
first
identifies
risks
operational
reputational
valuation
credit
and
then
identifies
the
ways
those
risks
could
rise
or
fall
the
aforementioned
fertilizer
company
may
be
purchasing
fertilizer
inputs
like
potash
from
other
countries
potash
is
often
found
in
russia
belarus
and
china
and
identify
their
largest
operational
risk
as
disruption
in
the
global
potash
supply
chain
they
further
identify
that
changes
in
congressional
political
control
could
increase
the
probability
that
the
supply
chain
is
disrupted
since
different
congresses
may
take
different
approaches
to
tariffs
sanctions
and
other
trade
related
policies
as
a
result
changes
in
political
control
directly
increases
or
decreases
the
firm
operational
risks
perhaps
the
clearest
example
of
this
description
of
risk
management
comes
from
the
cftc
report
managing
climate
risk
in
the
financial
system

expounded
at

at
length
about
transition
risk
which
they
define
as
the
risk
associated
with
the
uncertain
financial
impacts
that
could
result
from
a
transition
to
a
net
zero
emissions
economy
they
note
that
transition
risk
implicates
market
credit
policy
legal
technological
and
reputational
risks
for
firms
and
must
be
a
part
of
any
honest
risk
assessment
most
importantly
the
report
specifically
identifies
how
transition
risks
could
arise
for
example
from
changes
in
policy
along
with
other
factors
such
as
technological
breakthroughs
and
shifts
in
consumer
preferences
and
social
norms
as
the
financial
stability
oversight
council
created
by
the
dodd

including

of

and

corroborates
policy
changes
along
with
technological
change
and
consumer
preference
changes
especially
if
delayed
or
uneven
in
application
and
therefore
requiring
more
abrupt
economic
shifts
may
lead
to
sharp
changes
in
the
values
of
certain
assets
or
liabilities
impacting
nonfinancial
activity
and
the
financial
sector
as
a
draft
rule
from
the
federal
reserve
board
states
financial
institutions
with
sound
risk
management
practices
employ
a
comprehensive
process
to
identify
emerging
and
material
risks
related
to
the
financial
institution
business
activities
the
risk
identification
process
should
include
input
from
stakeholders
across
the
organization
with
relevant
expertise
business
units
independent
risk
management
internal
audit
and
legal
risk
identification
includes
assessment
of
climate
related
financial
risks
across
a
range
of
plausible
scenarios
and
under
various
time
horizons
as
both
reports
show
firms
must
consider
all
of
the
risks
facing
their
businesses
and
the
only
honest
and
accurate
way
to
do
so
is
to
consider
the
way
changes
in
policy
affect
those
risks
there
is
ample
precedent
from
the
cftc
recognizing
that
businesses
manage
risk
by
considering
the
factors
that
impact
the
likelihood
and
severity
of
potential
harms
the
cftc
climate
report
notes
that
uncertainty
associated
with
policy
risk
is
already
penalizing
oil
companies
that
are
investing
in
undeveloped
fossil

reserves
and
financial
market
participants
are
already

ways

election
contracts
are
appropriate
for
businesses
that
face

impacted
by

for
these
businesses
election
contracts
can
be
an
important
hedge
that
is
part
of
their

process
that
a

the

the
potential

that

faces
naturally
there
are
many
operational
risks
what
if
one
of
the
boring
rigs
breaks
but
those
are
hardly
the
only
risks
they
face
but
the
business
may
determine
that
other
potential
harms
will
be
directly
impacted
by
elections
and
political
control
for
example
retained
profits
and
shifts
in
the
demand
curve
are
influenced
by
which
party
wins
congress
as
parties
have
substantially
different
positions
on
corporate
taxes
this
is
not
just
rates
the
tax
code
is
filled
with
numerous
and
interrelated
provisions
that
impact
businesses
in
different
ways
the
business
may
have
a
number
of
different
provisions
that
while
seemingly
minor
to
the
average
citizen
impact
them
deeply
for
instance
while
millions
of
companies
are

as

or

for

protection
however
for
the
firms
for
which
those
minor
provisions
matter
they
matter
a
great
deal
in
order
to
get
enough
liquidity
those
firms
would
essentially
pool
their
liquidity
on
a
general
congressional
control
contract
where
the
firms
who
care
about
each
of
the
thousands
of
minor
provisions
all
might
participate

and
emission
standards
for

as
a
result
depending
on
how
the

plays
out
certain

mitigatory
actions
may
be

an

to
reduce
their

to

in
the

way
a
corn

can
not
cost
efficiently
diversify
into
an
uncorrelated

in
order
to
reduce
their
exposure
to

prices
a
firm
may
conduct
some
simple
math

increase
the

of

expectation
of

of

as
a
result
a
financial
hedging
product
may
be
more
appropriate
suppose
the
probability
of
party
x
winning
control
of
congress
was
and
the
price
of
the

was
thus
in
that
case
they
would
purchase
60
contracts
for
a
total
of

the
adverse
event
does
occur
the
firm
would
be
paid
to
compensate
for
their
expected
losses
if
the

does
not
occur
they
would
not
be
paid
but
they
would
reap
the
benefits
of
the
more
favorable
event
occurring
this
one
example
amongst
thousands
provided
to
the
commission
demonstrates
how
election
contracts
provide
an
obvious
hedging
utility
misplaced
election
integrity
concerns
in
its
discussion
the
non
exclusive
list
of
examples
of
gaming
set
forth
in
proposed
the
commission
specifically
notes
that
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
or
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
would
be
included
in
the
proposal
plainly
speaking
as
described
above
it
should
not
be
elections
are
not
games
as
is
obvious
to
anyone
who
votes
as
justification
for
this
the
commission
raises
several
alleged
concerns
first
that
this
particular
subset
of
gaming
contracts
would
raise
unique
additional
public
interest
concerns
relating
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
the
appropriate
role
of
the
commission
in
this
area
the
commission
creatively
considers
a
hypothetical
where
permitting
trading
in
these
types
of
contracts
could
create
monetary
incentives
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
even
when
such
votes
may
be
contrary
to
a
voter
or
organized
groups
of
voters
political
views
second
conduct
designed
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
could
be
used
to
manipulate
the
markets
in
such
contracts
or
conversely
that
the
markets
in
such
contracts
could
be
manipulated
to
influence
elections
or
electoral
perceptions
and
as
an
example
false
reporting
or
other
misinformation
such
as
inaccurate
polling
or
voter
surveys
or
false
news
reporting
could
be
used
to
distort
the
information
underlying
price
formation
in
such
contracts
these
concerns
fall
flat
neither
the
proposal
nor
the
kalshi
order
make
any
effort
to
substantiate
either
aspect
of
this
parade
of
horribles
and
instead
ignore
contrary
evidence
the
commission
can
find
no
real
world
examples
that
election
contracts
incentivize
manipulation
of
elections
including
by
spreading
misinformation
by
contrast
the
comments
submitted
to
the
commission
in
support
of
kalshi
election
contracts
note
repeatedly
that
the
likelihood
of
this
kind
of
manipulation
occurring
is
extremely
remote
if
anything
listing
the
contracts
on
federally
regulated
exchanges
would
ameliorate
manipulation
concerns
associated
with
unregulated
and
offshore
markets
and
the
neutral
market
driven
data
generated
by
a
regulated
exchange
is
the
best
way
to
mitigate
the
threats
of
misinformation
including
from
the
fake
polls
that
the
cftc
purports
to
worry
about
in
the
kalshi
order
and
again
with
this
proposal
the
cftc
did
not
consider
any
relevant
data
and
and
analysis
ignored
all
contrary
evidence
and
instead
speculated
that
election
contracts
could
create
monetary
incentives
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
even
when
such
votes
may
be
contrary
to
a
voter
political
preferences
or
views
of
such
candidates
besides
for
the
speculative
nature
of
this
concern
it
is
not
credible
voting
for
an
opposing
candidate
to
potentially
influence
an
outcome
contingent
on
dozens
of
federal
elections
is
not
plausible
as
described
in
the
comments
surrounding
the
kalshi
order
the
concern
that
voters
will
steal
votes
from
themselves
is
speculative
abstract
and
almost
entirely
absent
from
experience
with
political
prediction
markets
more
fundamentally
the
notion
that
an
election
market
would
meaningfully
alter
incentives
to
manipulate
elections
or
to
distribute
misinformation
is
utterly
implausible
given
the
enormous
consequences
of
election
outcomes
the
massive
sums
already
spent
by
political
campaigns
and
the
sheer
volume
of
inputs
to
the
national
political
discourse
election
contracts
would
at
most
be
a
drop
in
the
bucket
moreover
the
very
length
to
which
the
commission
stretches
this
public
interest
concern
demonstrates
the
very
lack
of
any
actual
substantive
concern
as
noted
in
footnote
124
of
the
proposal
the
commission
believes
that
permitting
trading
in
contracts
involving
political
contests
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
or
concerning
a
supranational
organization
also
would
raise
these
public
interest
concerns
just
as
permitting
trading
in
contracts
involving
political
contest
in
the
united
states
would
but
to
think
that
by
allowing
trading
on
a
contract
on
a
political
contest
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
on
a
cftc
regulated
dcm
would
have
any
possible
impact
of
public
interest
concerns
relating
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
the
appropriate
role
of
the
commission
in
this
area
in
a
foreign
election
a
foreign
country
where
the
cftc
has
not
one
iota
of
possible
jurisdiction
is
an
idea
completely
untethered
to
reality
is
the
cftc
concerned
for
the
perception
of
weather
integrity
or
the
accuracy
rate
of
meteorologists
forecasts
no
are
there
monetary
incentives
or
concerns
of
false
reporting
or
other
misinformation
to
forecast
for
rain
when
a
meteorologist
wants
a
sunny
day
or
other
manipulation
concerns
as
to
the
weather
itself
no
and
weather
markets
are
traded
on
cftc
regulated
entities
the
same
should
be
true
for
elections
the
election
cop
concern
is
inconceivable
and
incongruent
with
commission
practice
as
an
additional
concern
the
proposal
notes
that
the
commission
is
not
tasked
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
laws
however
if
trading
was
permitted
on
cftc
registered
exchanges
in
event
contracts
that
involve
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
a
political
contest
then
the
commission
could
find
itself
investigating
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
that
suggestion
is
frankly
absurd
the
cftc
regulates
countless
derivatives
markets
involving
commodities
over
which
it
lacks
independent
expertise
or
authority
for
example
while
the
commission
oversees
trading
in
futures
contracts
on
the
500
it
does
not
regulate
stocks
that
is
the
job
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
the
cftc
relies
on
to
police
the
underlying
market
likewise
while
the
cftc
supervises
trading
on
derivatives
based
on
gdp
data
it
is
the
bureau
of
economic
analysis
that
has
responsibility
for
producing
and
ensuring
the
integrity
of
that
data
the
same
is
true
for
various
other
contracts
where
the
role
of
the
commission
is
to
oversee
the
trading
as
described
in
the
2008
concept
release
on
the
appropriate
regulatory
treatment
of
event
contracts
the
commission
is
not
the
crop
yield
police
and
has
displaced
the
role
of
the
usda
the
commission
is
not
the
police
for
changes
to
corporate
officers
or
asset
purchases
and
has
not
displaced
the
role
of
the
sec
the
commission
is
not
the
police
for
regional
insured
property
losses
which
is
the
domain
of
state
insurance
regulators
the
commission
is
not
the
bankruptcy
police
which
is
the
domain
of
the
courts
the
commission
is
not
the
temperature
police
and
the
list
goes
on
as
the
proposal
recognizes
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
intended
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
or
expend
its
resources
to
regulate
elections
that
is
correct
the
federal
election
commission
department
of
justice
and
many
other
state
and
federal
regulators
already
shoulder
the
critical
responsibility
of
ensuring
that
our
elections
are
fair
and
secure
having
election
contracts
trading
on
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
will
not
transform
the
commission
into
the
police
for
elections
just
as
the
commission
is
not
the
police
for
the
many
contracts
already
trading
on
cftc
regulated
exchanges
iv
the
current
judicial
review
of
the
kalshi
order
the
proposal
acknowledges
that
the
kalshi
order
is
currently
pending
judicial
review
critically
fatal
to
this
proposal
however
the
commission
ignores
the
fact
that
the
substance
of
this
proposal
itself
is
under
judicial
review
the
statutory
underpinnings
of
this
proposal
will
rise
or
fall
based
on
the
outcome
of
the
judicial
review
of
the
kalshi
order
as
this
proposal
is
substantively
based
on
the
flawed
reasoning
in
the
kalshi
order
the
timing
of
this
proposal
during
judicial
review
of
its
substance
and
legality
seems
like
an
attempt
to
potentially
influence
the
judicial
review
or
disregard
it
altogether
missing
comment
letters
this
proposal
demonstrates
the
commission
continued
refusal
to
engage
with
the
points
and
evidence
submitted
by
commenters
this
includes
comments
relevant
to
the
definition
of
gaming
regulation
and
event
contracts
generally
the
substance
of
this
proposal
most
recently
surrounding
requested
by
the
commission
prior
to
the
kalshi
order
as
this
proposal
the
kalshi
order
and
the
materials
submitted
as
part
of
the
judicial
review
make
clear
the
commission
has
and
continues
to
make
poorly
supported
assertions
in
the
face
of
concrete
contrary
proof
staring
at
it
right
from
the
pudding
bowl
the
cftc
asked
for
the
public
input
on
the
substantive
points
of
this
proposal
prior
to
issuing
the
kalshi
order
but
then
summarily
ignored
the
public
input
and
the
reams
of
evidence
provided
and
instead
cherry
picked
a
few
comments
that
supported
the
cftc
agenda
of
protecting
wall
street
monopoly
over
risk
management
and
market
access
tools
some
of
the
many
examples
of
the
comments
ignored
by
the
cftc
include
industry
participants
academics
cftc
registrants
former
cftc
officials
and
a
host
of
others
one
theme
described
by
various
comments
but
seemingly
absent
from
the
commission
discussion
on
this
topic
is
that
partisan
control
of
congress
has
vast
economic
consequences
both
directly
and
through
its
influence
on
policy
which
is
why
major
financial
institutions
routinely
offer
projections
on
the
economic
impacts
of
election
outcomes
ahead
of
the
2020
federal
election
for
instance
bank
of
america
analyzed
the
likely
effects
of
different
congressional
outcomes
on
fiscal
stimulus
tariffs
tax
rates
and
regulations
researchers
too
have
consistently
found
that
the
balance
of
political
power
affects
the
prices
of
equities
commodities
and
other
assets
businesses
and
individuals
who
submitted
comments
agree
a
software
company
serving
green
energy
ventures
explained
in
a
comment
that
its
success
hinges
in
part
on
political
outcomes
including
control
of
congress
and
associated
policy
changes
a
fund
founder
set
forth
how
biotech
startups
face
congressional
risks
including
cuts
to
research
funding
and
stalled
regulatory
appointments
and
the
ceo
of
a
recycling
robotics
firm
recounted
that
legislation
expanding
recycling
is
likely
to
rise
or
fall
depending
on
which
party
triumphs
similarly
a
comment
of
renowned
investor
jorge
paolo
lemann
explained
that
investment
may
look
very
different
if
hypothetical
legislative
and
regulatory
events
occur
and
if
an
election
outcome
makes
those
events
materially
more
likely
it
poses
significant
risk
to
the
parties
to
the
deal
for
example
if
republicans
take
control
of
congress
in
2024
renewable
energy
subsidies
will
not
vanish
overnight
but
a
republican
win
would
present
a
serious
risk
of
cuts
allowing
election
related
contracts
to
be
traded
on
cftc
registrants
allow
green
energy
firms
to
hedge
that
risk
commenters
wrote
that
their
firm
would
hedge
against
risk
that
a
hostile
government
could
be
elected
not
merely
that
a
particular
policy
will
be
enacted
and
that
investors
consider
how
business
risks
indisputably
rise
when
certain
congresses
come
into
power
and
hedging
instruments
are
needed
to
mitigate
that
risk
this
example
of
which
there
are
many
more
demonstrates
this
proposal
hamartia
the
continued
refusal
to
engage
with
the
points
and
evidence
submitted
by
commenters
that
are
on
point
but
adverse
to
the
commission
agenda
laid
out
in
the
proposal
i
encourage
the
commission
not
to
do
the
same
with
this
comment
and
all
other
similar
comments
submitted
vi
the
proposal
costs
and
benefit
analysis
is
just
wrong
measured
relative
to
the
baseline
status
quo
condition
this
proposal
would
not
create
meaningful
benefits
for
market
participants
and
the
public
and
would
instead
result
in
substantial
costs
costs
that
would
far
outweigh
any
incorrect
benefit
the
proposal
suggests
as
required
to
by
section
of
the
cea
the
commission
must
consider
the
costs
and
benefits
of
its
actions
before
promulgating
a
regulation
under
the
cea
or
issuing
certain
orders
including
five
specific
categories
of
impact
i
protection
of
market
participants
and
the
public
ii
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
futures
markets
iii
price
discovery
iv
sound
risk
management
practices
and
v
other
public
interest
considerations
this
proposal
fails
in
each
one
the
costs
of
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
considerably
eclipse
any
incorrectly
perceived
benefit
the
commission
contemplates
that
some
registered
entities
may
incur
a
one
time
compliance
cost
to
understand
and
implement
the
proposed
gaming
definition
but
the
proposal
does
seem
to
understand
the
far
reaching
implications
of
its
proposed
regulation
the
only
one
time
compliance
cost
that
is
possible
under
the
proposal
is
the
cost
of
closing
down
a
registered
entities
business
because
as
explained
above
the
proposal
is
so
pervasive
to
event
contracts
it
will
have
a
chilling
effect
on
the
regulated
industry
but
not
the
unregulated
industry
they
will
happily
continue
to
serve
customers
without
any
form
of
oversight
far
more
than
the
10
hours
approximated
by
the
commission
the
destructive
impact
of
this
proposal
is
indicated
by
the
commission
own
explanation
of
anticipated
implementation
if
the
proposed
rule
amendments
are
adopted
the
commission
anticipates
that
exchanges
whose
product
offerings
include
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
will
in
order
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
rules
file
self
certification
submissions
to
permanently
delist
the
contracts
and
remove
reference
to
the
contracts
in
their
exchange
rules
exchanges
may
also
need
to
take
steps
to
effectuate
the
orderly
wind
down
of
contracts
involving
gaming
that
are
listed
and
available
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
final
rule
amendments
in
the
federal
register
and
that
have
settlement
dates
beyond
the
60
day
implementation
period
proposed
by
the
commission
in
other
words
the
commission
is
anticipating
the
entire
businesses
will
be
shuttered
in
60
hours
or
less
unlike
the
commission
assertion
otherwise
the
number
of
contracts
impacted
by
this
proposal
is
vast
the
commission
claims
that
the
proposed
definition
also
would
support
the
commission
and
its
staff
in
the
effective
oversight
of
derivative
markets
including
by
supporting
the
efficient
and
effective
administration
of
the
contract
submission
and
review
process
by
helping
to
reduce
the
likelihood
that
contracts
are
submitted
to
the
commission
that
raise
public
interest
concerns
in
this
regard
among
other
things
the
proposed
definition
would
promote
the
commission
responsible
stewardship
and
efficient
use
of
the
tax
dollars
appropriated
to
it
by
reducing
the
need
for
individualized
contract
reviews
pursuant
to
in
the
commission
experience
a
review
pursuant
to
is
resource
intensive
and
consumes
hundreds
of
hours
of
staff
time
based
on
prior
experience
the
commission
estimates
that
each
review
conducted
pursuant
to
takes
on
average
approximately
625
hours
of
commission
staff
time
at
a
cost
of
approximately
but
instead
of
focusing
on
curtailing
the
industry
on
unreasonable
ground
the
commission
should
embrace
its
regulatory
function
develop
a
mechanism
to
more
efficiently
review
event
contracts
and
ask
congress
to
fund
more
staff
the
commission
fails
to
contemplate
the
costs
of
the
proposed
amendments
to
further
align
with
statutory
language
which
are
vast
far
more
than
any
potential
benefit
as
described
above
the
proposal
understanding
of
the
term
involve
in
the
statute
is
incorrect
and
inconsistently
applied
by
the
commission
the
proposal
also
fails
to
analyze
the
associated
costs
and
benefits
of
this
change
at
all
one
obvious
cost
of
this
aspect
of
the
proposal
is
that
it
creates
wild
uncertainty
the
proposal
would
create
a
malleable
definition
that
would
be
applied
by
the
commission
at
whim
resulting
in
registered
entities
and
market
participants
not
knowing
whether
or
not
an
event
contract
would
be
singled
out
by
the
commission
for
analysis
thus
disrupting
the
event
contract
industry
there
are
no
benefits
to
consider
for
this
result
perhaps
that
is
why
the
commission
did
list
any
the
proposal
fails
each
of
the
section
factors
the
proposal
evaluation
of
the
costs
and
benefits
of
the
proposed
amendments
to
in
light
of
the
five
broad
areas
of
market
and
public
concern
identified
in
section
of
the
cea
fails
1
protection
of
market
participants
and
the
public
contrary
to
the
commission
stated
belief
the
proposed
amendments
to
will
not
protect
market
participants
and
the
public
unlike
the
commission
assertion
that
event
contracts
could
particularly
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
market
participants
and
that
the
proposed
amendments
would
accordingly
enhance
protection
of
market
participants
the
opposite
is
true
the
proposed
prevention
of
the
listing
for
trading
or
acceptance
for
clearing
by
registered
entities
of
certain
event
contracts
and
those
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
would
harm
market
participants
by
removing
a
bona
fide
hedging
instrument
from
the
few
financial
risk
management
tools
available
to
the
mainstream
public
event
contracts
on
on
events
directly
related
to
retail
market
participants
businesses
and
lives
2
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
markets
the
proposal
will
decimate
the
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
the
event
contract
markets
it
is
seeking
to
remove
from
the
cftc
regulated
space
under
the
guise
of
a
just
limited
to
gaming
analysis
the
commission
claims
that
a
significant
proportion
of
event
contract
offerings
would
not
be
impacted
by
the
proposed
amendments
suggesting
that
the
overall
impact
of
the
rule
amendments
should
be
relatively
modest
moreover
the
stated
belief
of
the
commission
is
that
by
further
specifying
types
of
event
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
the
proposed
amendments
also
will
support
these
and
other
registered
entities
ability
to
develop
and
list
new
products
with
enhanced
confidence
regarding
such
products
compliance
with
the
cea
and
cftc
regulations
the
commission
believes
that
this
should
assist
registered
entities
as
well
as
applicants
for
registration
in
making
informed
business
decisions
with
respect
to
product
design
which
may
enhance
competitiveness
and
efficiency
the
only
help
that
this
proposal
would
provide
is
to
eliminate
the
indecision
of
whether
the
regulated
path
is
the
right
one
if
approved
the
event
contract
sphere
will
be
forced
away
from
the
regulated
space
a
result
that
as
demonstrated
from
the
ftx
collapse
and
the
existence
of
polymarket
is
surely
not
one
the
commission
is
hoping
for
3
price
discovery
as
barely
acknowledged
by
the
commission
the
proposed
amendments
will
have
a
direct
and
significant
impact
on
price
discovery
in
cftc
regulated
markets
as
is
obvious
event
contracts
provide
strong
informational
value
about
the
consensus
of
a
crowd
of
market
participants
who
are
willing
to
put
money
where
their
mouth
is
a
strong
price
basing
utility
that
the
commission
did
not
include
this
in
the
proposal
indicates
that
it
has
yet
to
understand
the
true
value
of
event
contracts
specifically
for
its
price
basing
utility
instead
of
shutting
them
down
the
commission
should
seek
to
understand
and
guide
the
future
development
of
event
contract
markets
4
sound
risk
management
practices
the
commission
could
not
identify
any
effect
of
the
proposed
amendments
on
sound
risk
management
practices
that
is
because
in
the
commission
mind
the
proposed
amendments
are
in
the
public
interest
the
exact
opposite
is
true
as
described
above
all
market
participants
are
involved
in
risk
management
of
their
businesses
for
example
or
other
aspects
that
impact
their
lives
those
are
risks
that
can
be
managed
by
event
contracts
when
those
event
contracts
are
overseen
by
the
cftc
that
risk
management
is
done
in
a
sound
and
safe
manner
the
commission
should
look
to
embrace
event
contracts
not
reject
them
for
lack
of
understanding
5
other
public
interest
considerations
the
proposal
consideration
of
public
interest
considerations
is
a
straw
man
the
commission
first
states
that
the
purpose
of
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
that
certain
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
may
not
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
and
therefore
the
proposed
amendments
seek
to
support
this
objective
by
further
specifying
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
because
as
described
above
the
proposal
misconstrues
the
commission
statutory
mandate
and
the
public
interest
it
follows
that
any
mistaken
consideration
of
the
public
interest
necessarily
fails
a
building
can
not
be
successfully
built
on
faulty
foundations
so
too
this
proposal
