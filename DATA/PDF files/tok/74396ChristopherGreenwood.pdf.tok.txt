i
am
dr
eric
crampton
chief
economist
with
the
new
zealand
initiative
in
wellington
new
zealand
we
are
a
public
policy
think
tank
with
the
initiative
i
authored
jointly
with
internet
new
zealand
analog
regulation
digital
worlds
a
stocktake
on
the
state
of
regulation
in
new
zealand
as
it
relates
to
the
digital
economy
that
report
included
a
section
on
new
zealand
experience
with
ipredict
an
early
and
innovative
prediction
market
on
political
events
prior
to
joining
the
initiative
i
was
senior
lecturer
in
economics
with
the
university
of
canterbury
equivalent
of
us
associate
professor
i
served
as
academic
advisor
to
ipredict
while
at
canterbury
and
supervised
graduate
work
using
prediction
market
data
i
maintain
an
adjunct
senior
fellow
position
with
the
university
i
urge
the
cftc
not
only
to
allow
kalshi
to
run
markets
on
congressional
outcomes
but
also
to
simplify
the
process
for
the
opening
of
such
markets
a
prediction
market
should
not
have
to
run
cap
in
hand
to
its
regulator
for
authorisation
of
every
contract
there
is
no
risk
to
be
mitigated
that
is
commensurate
with
that
level
of
regulatory
cost
and
it
forecloses
opportunities
to
open
new
contracts
in
response
to
events
prediction
contracts
on
election
and
congressional
events
open
opportunities
for
discovering
the
likelihood
of
different
outcomes
and
hedging
against
those
risks
at
least
as
importantly
they
can
provide
the
basis
for
estimating
the
effects
of
different
policy
outcomes
futures
contracts
on
political
events
are
no
more
akin
to
gambling
than
are
futures
contracts
on
oil
prices
each
trader
brings
their
information
to
the
platform
helping
to
move
prices
toward
a
more
accurate
reflection
of
true
underlying
probabilities
work
by
oprea
and
hanson
a
decade
ago
hanson
amp
oprea
2009
a
manipulator
can
aid

accuracy

showed
that
these
markets
are
resilient
to
speculative
or
motivated
attack
a
trader
seeking
to
push
the
price
around
to
make
their
preferred
candidate
or
policy
look
better
or
worse
simply
provide
liquidity
that
attracts
traders
to
profit
by
bringing
prices
back
to
fundamental
values
and
the
experience
we
had
at
ipredict
was
consistent
with
hanson
and
oprea
lab
work
ipredict
traced
prices
of
its
contracts
against
outcomes
if
a
contract
closes
at
1
if
an
event
occurs
and
at
0
if
it
does
not
contracts
trading
at
ahead
of
closure
should
pay
out
at
1
around
10
of
the
time
and
it
turned
out
that
contracts
trading
at
paid
out
about
one
time
in
five
contracts
trading
at
paid
out
at
1
about
50
of
the
time
and
so
on
there
was
a
bit
of
bias
in
the
tails
with
overpricing
of
very
longshot
bets
and
underpricing
of
sure
things
but
none
of
it
seemed
based
on
manipulation
just
liquidity
and
holding
cost
issues
the
market
just
worked
ipredict
wound
up
closing
not
because
of
any
issues
in
the
market
but
because
the
regulatory
burden
became
too
great
the
market
consisted
of
hundreds
of
very
small
traders
and
few
large
traders
in
part
because
deposit
limits
were
too
stringent
but
lots
and
lots
of
small
value
accounts
meant
that
when
our
regulators
imposed
aml
know
your
customer
regulations
at
a
time
when
automated
kyc
mechanism
had
yet
been
developed
to
any
reasonable
extent
the
market
faced
impossible
costs
relative
to
its
scale
and
it
closed
total
balances
held
by
ipredict
at
the
time
were
on
the
order
of
and
most
of
its
traders
had
account
balances
below
the
cost
of
kyc
onboarding
hedging
opportunities
matter
though
those
opportunities
may
be
limited
if
the
maximum
allowed
deposit
is
too
low
outcomes
across
industries
ranging
from
defence
and
energy
to
agriculture
and
transport
can
vary
considerably
depending
on
the
composition
of
congress
and
whether
control
shifts
being
able
to
hedge
against
those
risks
can
matter
it
would
in
this
case
be
particularly
important
for
smaller
businesses
for
a
large
company
where
changes
in
congress
can
be
worth
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
hedging
in
a
market
subject
to
tight
deposit
limits
is
of
fairly
limited
value
but
it
could
be
important
for
smaller
businesses
and
subcontractors
and
their
employees
and
everyone
can
make
use
of
the
information
provided
through
the
prices
that
emerge
in
these
markets
enabling
them
to
make
better
informed
decisions
prices
on
political
and
congressional
events
do
just
provide
options
for
hedging
which
can
be
really
important
hedgers
provide
liquidity
that
draws
in
traders
who
are
purely
interested
in
the
raw
likelihood
of
the
event
transpiring
helping
to
improve
prices
they
also
provide
opportunity
for
combinatorial
markets
down
the
track
things
like
for
example
what
will
the
unemployment
rate
be
in
september
2023
if
policy
x
is
approved
by
congress
and
what
will
it
be
if
policy
x
is
not
approved
by
congress
this
kind
of
information
can
be
of
immense
value
but
if
every
new
contract
has
to
run
through
this
kind
of
process
where
you
even
having
to
get
submissions
from
economists
out
in
new
zealand
it
just
far
less
likely
to
happen
these
markets
need
flexiblity
to
respond
to
events
as
they
transpire
what
experience
we
had
with
ipredict
suggests
cftc
really
does
have
anything
substantial
to
worry
about
in
allowing
contracts
on
political
events
if
anything
they
heightened
voter
engagement
the
ce
of
ipredict
even
featured
on
the
nightly
news
during
the
election
giving
the
latest
on
election
market
prices
and
for
that
brief
period
whenever
blowhard
partisans
insisted
that
some
outcome
was
going
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on
the
event
and
ask
them
why
they
thought
that
price
was
wrong
and
whether
they
actually
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
was
it
was
a
remarkable
era
ipredict
inflation
forecasts
they
also
had
markets
on
inflation
going
out
several
years
it
was
so
very
good
wound
up
being
noted
in
our
reserve
bank
monetary
policy
statements
i
desperately
miss
it
i
envy
the
opportunities
americans
could
have
if
cftc
takes
a
sensible
approach
to
regulation
