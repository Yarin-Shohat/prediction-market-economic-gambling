proposal
seeks
sweeping
restrictions
on
event
contracts
with
potentially
far
reaching
negative
implications
for
the
public
interest
the
core
of
the
proposal
which
aims
to
categorically
disallow
any
event
contract
involving
or
relating
to
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
defined
as
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
terrorism
war
assassination
gaming
or
similar
activities
betrays
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
how
event
contract
markets
operate
and
ignores
well
established
public
benefits
of
these
markets
the
proposal
does
not
stand
up
to
legal
logical
or
empirical
scrutiny
the
commission
overly
broad
interpretation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
the
act
and
its
gerrymandered
definition
of
gaming
are
contrary
to
both
the
spirit
and
the
letter
of
the
act
and
are
sure
to
invite
intense
legal
opposition
in
light
of
the
recent
supreme
court
decision
in
loper
bright
enterprises
et
al
raimondo
the
proposal
claim
that
legalization
and
regulation
of
markets
on
enumerated
activities
blanketly
harms
the
public
interest
has
no
sound
logical
basis
brushing
aside
markets
clear
and
substantive
public
benefits
for
hedging
risk
and
aggregating
information
in
favor
of
hypothetical
and
unsubstantiated
claims
of
the
markets
harms
finally
many
of
the
commission
claims
concerning
the
potential
drawbacks
and
risks
of
such
markets
are
directly
refuted
by
a
mountain
of
empirical
evidence
and
data
that
in
fact
proves
the
converse
of
the
commission
claims
event
contract
markets
are
a
valuable
public
good
for
which
there
is
no
evidence
of
significant
manipulation
or
widespread
use
for
any
of
the
nefarious
purposes
that
the
commission
alleges
the
commission
proposed
actions
are
against
the
public
interest
plainly
event
contract
markets
enable
participants
to
efficiently
hedge
risks
to
one
off
or
non
standard
events
such
as
elections
global
events
war
terrorism
pandemic
and
other
catastrophic
outcomes
this
internal
benefit
of
facilitating
hedging
produces
the
additional
external
benefit
of
a
well
honed
price
signal
which
informs
the
general
public
about
significant
events
in
the
public
and
national
interest
the
commission
proposal
seeks
to
do
away
with
these
benefits
instead
advancing
a
distorted
perspective
clouded
by
remote
possibilities
and
unsubstantiated
claims
about
adverse
consequences
of
these
markets
the
resulting
draconian
measures
in
the
proposal
would
disallow
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
for
which
there
are
substantial
public
and
national
benefits
the
commission
proposal
ignores
widely
publicized
and
well
known
data
and
case
studies
that
demonstrate
the
clear
public
and
national
interest
benefits
of
event
contracts
without
offering
any
concrete
data
or
evidence
to
substantiate
the
concerns
voiced
in
the
proposal
the
available
data
as
detailed
below
shows
that
many
of
the
event
contracts
the
commission
aims
to
classify
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
are
in
fact
critical
to
the
public
and
national
interest
the
proposal
is
an
attempt
to
side
step
the
commission
mandate
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
or
the
act
section
the
commission
shall
approve
a
new
contract
or
other
instrument
unless
the
commission
finds
that
the
new
contract
or
other
instrument
would
violate
this
chapter
including
regulations
section
provides
specific
guidance
on
event
contracts
which
when
combined
with
requires
that
event
contracts
be
approved
unless
they
i
involve
illegal
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
similar
activity
enumerated
topics
and
ii
are
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
act
does
not
expressly
declare
contracts
involving
one
or
more
of
the
enumerated
topics
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
the
act
tasks
the
commission
to
i
identify
that
a
contract
involves
one
or
more
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
if
it
is
deemed
that
the
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
ii
to
determine
whether
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
mandate
under
the
act
is
explicitly
a
two
step
process
which
the
commission
seeks
to
arbitrarily
collapse
to
a
one
step
process
by
virtue
of
its
proposed
amendment
sections
and
together
imply
that
any
given
event
contract
shall
be
regarded
as
in
the
public
interest
unless
and
until
determined
otherwise
by
the
commission
as
is
clear
by
the
wording
of
the
act
which
states
that
the
commission
shall
approve
unless
the
commission
finds
that
the
new
contract
would
violate
this
chapter
the
commission
proposal
to
categorically
disqualify
all
contracts
involving
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
therefore
contradicts
the
commission
mandate
under
the
act
which
explicitly
calls
for
a
two
step
evaluation
protocol
the
commission
states
the
commission
interprets
cea
section
to
provide
that
the
contract
may
not
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
by
a
registered
entity
if
the
commission
finds
both
that
i
the
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
or
prescribed
similar
activity
and
ii
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
proposal
11
we
agree
with
this
interpretation
in
particular
the
mere
categorization
of
a
contract
as
involving
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
does
not
on
its
own
disqualify
the
contract
from
being
listed
for
clearing
or
trading
by
a
cftc
regulated
entity
a
contract
satisfying
criterion
i
must
also
be
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
criterion
ii
the
commission
lacks
the
authority
to
simply
declare
broad
categories
of
contracts
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
discussed
in
detail
below
the
commission
offers
no
clear
criteria
on
which
to
base
their
public
interest
judgment
much
less
a
cogent
argument
establishing
that
the
categories
it
wishes
to
disqualify
fail
to
meet
the
public
interest
standard
to
refute
the
commission
overly
broad
interpretation
that
contracts
involving
the
enumerated
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
is
enough
to
provide
just
a
single
contract
involving
those
activities
that
does
serve
the
public
interest
several
such
examples
are
given
throughout
the
comment
below
and
specifically
in
sections
and
for
the
reasons
summarized
above
and
detailed
below
the
commission
proposal
itself
is
a
public
interest
concern
it
is
an
ill
conceived
logically
backwards
attempt
to
vest
unelected
commissioners
with
undue
power
by
depriving
the
people
of
a
necessary
and
invaluable
public
good
to
avoid
these
public
interest
concerns
the
proposal
must
be
rejected
in
its
entirety
at
minimum
the
comment
period
should
be
extended
for
at
least
90
days
the
commission
should
use
this
extended
period
to
further
investigate
and
consider
the
data
presented
below
and
also
to
solicit
more
thorough
input
from
those
individuals
and

who
will
be
most
affected
by
the
commission
action
a

posed
by

in

an
event
contract
is
an
agreement
that
depends
on
the
occurrence
or
non

of
some
event
for
this
letter
we
assume
that
the
contingency
in
event

specifies
the
circumstances
related
to
an
event
under
which
one
party
will
be
entitled
to
collect
a
pre
specified
amount
of
money
from
another
party
event
contracts
need
not
be
monetary
in
nature
but
the
most
relevant
cases
discussed
here
involve
a
contract
in

is
entitled
to
some

that
the
specific

are
not
fundamental

this
definition
specific

can
resolve
to
any
values
without

in
the
fundamental
discussion
given
here
our
assumption
that
contracts

the
values
of

do
not

the
scope
of
the

an
agreement
between
parties
that
instead
pays

on
no
can
be
handled
by
assuming
contracts
are
exchanged
between
the
parties
for

only
simple
binary

generally
to

the

in
this

we
focus
on
two
primary
and
complementary
ways
that
the
vast
majority
of

can
and
do
serve
the
public

i
by
offering
a
vehicle
to

and
ii
by
aggregating
diffuse
information
through
an
accurate

in
section
we
discuss
how
event
contract
markets
simultaneously
achieve
both
of
these
objectives
in
a
mutually
beneficial
way
hedging
case
studies
event
contracts
provide
a
straightforward
way
for
individuals
and
businesses
to
hedge
non
standard
isolated
and
specific
risks
that
can
not
be
mitigated
by
other
means
without
an
alternative
outlet
to
hedge
such
risks
individuals
and
businesses
are
forced
to
accept
an
unwanted
risk
profile
or
otherwise
modify
behaviors
to
avoid
these
risks
either
way
these
risks
are
ultimately
passed
along
to
the
rest

for

one
such
benefit
is
the

qbi

which
is
set

in

the
scheduled

can
change
however
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the

expiration
of
the
qbi
deduction
could
reduce
net
profit
of
a
small
business
by
as
much
as
approximately

the

allows
for
a

to

such
an
outcome
could
have
long
term
implications
for
the

and
growth
of
the

as
the
increased
income
could
be
used
to
invest
in

better
training
for
employees
new
facilities
and
improved
processes
uncertainty
in
the
outcome
of
the
2024
election
however
puts
any
small
business
owner
currently
relying
on
this
deduction
in
limbo
unable
to
plan
appropriately
for
the
future
suppose
a
business
owner
believes
that
there
is
a
high
greater
than
95
probability
that
the
qbi
deduction
will
be
extended
beyond
2025
upon
election
of
a
republican
president
in
2024
the
possibility
that
a
democratic
president
is
elected
therefore
exposes
the
business
owner
to
risk
without
an
event
contract
market
involving
the
related
events
whether
the
qbi
deduction
will
be
extended
or
the
related
electoral
events
the
business
owner
can
not
manage
its
risk
and
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
election
outcome
event
contracts
related
to
the
2024
election
would
however
enable
the
owner
to
manage
risk
by
purchasing
contracts
that
are
worth
if
the
republican
party
does
not
win
the
presidency
by
purchasing
such
contracts
the
owner
is
able
to
lock
in
some
of
the
benefit
of
the
potential
qbi
deduction
extension
ensuring
economic
stability
regardless
of
the
outcome
this
example
is
one
of
many
ways
that
event
contract
markets
enable
businesses
and
individuals
to
hedge
against
the
risks
of
one
off
future
events
for
example
the
owner
of
a
different
business
than
the
one
above
whose
company
is
involved
in
green
energy
may
not
be
concerned
with
the
qbi
deduction
but
rather
the
potential
repeal
of
favorable
acts
of
legislation
if
a
republican
president
were
to
win
the
2024
presidential
election
the
risks
facing
this
business
are
therefore
complementary
to
the
risks
of

existence
of

hedging
geopolitical
risk
an
airline
requires
fuel
to
fly
its
planes
to
operate
successfully
the
airline
often
begins
scheduling
flights
months
in
advance
in
selling
a
ticket
for
a
flight
three
months
in
the
future
the
airline
is
exposed
to
potential
changes
in
the
price
of
fuel
the
airline
can
hedge
this
exposure
by
trading
in
the
appropriate
commodities
and
futures
markets
that
are
regulated
by
the
cftc
as
the
airline
industry
provides
an
important
public
service
the
continual
and
smooth
operation
of
airline
companies
is
in
the
public
interest
but
airlines
face
many
more
risks
than
the
future
price
of
fuel
in
refusing
the
authorize
event
contract
markets
that
would
allow
airlines
to
hedge
those
risks
the
cftc
forces
many
airlines
to
take
excess
risks
these
risks
in
turn
are
passed
along
to
the
general
public
for
example
consider
an
airline
for
which
100
of
business
involves
flights
to
and
from
the
united
states
and
china
russia
eastern
europe
and
the
middle
east
by
focusing
exclusively
on
international
flights
to
these
regions
the
airline
realizes
a
competitive
advantage
which
allows
it
to
offer
higher
quality
and
lower
cost
service
to
customers
who
travel
to
those
regions
the
ability
of
such
a
company
to
operate
is
therefore
in
the
public
interest
but
the
company
ability
to
provide
this
service
is
limited
by
the
company
ability
to
manage
the
host
of
risks
associated
with
operating
between
the
united
states
and
these
specific
countries
such
a
business
is
constantly
exposed
to
the
risks
posed
by
the
political
situation
and
diplomatic
relationships
of
the
countries
it
operates
within
and
between
myriad
events
can
and
do
impact
the
airline
ability
to
operate
including
changes
in
tax
rates
whether
the
united
states
government
will
continue
to
grant
chinese
nationals
visas
to
visit
study
or
work
in
the

whether
the
chinese

will
continue
to
allow
airlines
to

its
country
civil
and
political
unrest
in
the
middle
east
territorial
disputes
between
russia
and
neighboring
countries
and
the
unexpected
outbreak
of
a
global
pandemic
the
above
risks
are
not
hypothetical
or
of
remote
likelihood
during
the
past
decade
every
one
of
the
above
events
has
occurred
as
this
example
shows
risk
exposure
is
not
limited
to
the
cost
of
physical
goods
or
other
well
known
financial
indicators
such
as
fuel
and
interest
rates
events
involving
political
elections
international
relations
and
similar
such
occurrences
all
pose
risk
to
companies
individuals
and
the
public
as
a
whole
event
contract
markets
on
the
relevant
events
provide
a
straightforward
vehicle
to
hedge
and
better
manage
these
risks
to
the
benefit
not
only
of
the
parties
of
the
event
contract
but
also
the
general
public
which
benefits
from
the
smooth
and
stable
operation
of
the
economic
sectors
otherwise
impacted
by
such
risks
thus
although
the
hedging
use
case
of
any
given
event
contract
market
may
be
tailored
and
specific
to
a
small
number
of
participants
the
impact
of
that
one
participant
ability
to
hedge
has
far
reaching
public
benefits
though
illustrated
in
the
context
of
the
airline
industry
the
circumstances
of
this
case
study
apply
to
almost
every
industry
and
business
sector
in
the
broader
economy
all
industries
are
exposed
to
specific
risks
that
are
neither
widely
publicized
nor
well
understood
outside
of
the
industry
due
to
the
interconnectivity
of
the
economy
these
risks
impact
the
entire
economy
as
these
risks
could
easily
be
mitigated
through
individual
or
a
basket
of
event
contracts
there
is
a
clear
public
benefit
to
broad

make

about

the

can
therefore

against

to

the
existence
of

is
especially
important
as

and
the
unprecedented
possibility
of
replacing
a
major
party
candidate
less
than
six
months
before

the
general
public
would
greatly
benefit
from
well
functioning
prediction

offering
i
simple

on
the
major

nominees
and
ii
conditional

on

given
the
different
possibilities
unlike
simple
event
contracts
which
are
determined
by
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
a
single
event
a
conditional
event
contract
depends
on
two
events
called
the
conditional
event
and
the
key
event
the
event
contract
is
null
and
void
resulting
in
a
net
zero
transfer
among
all
involved
parties
unless
the
conditional
event
occurs
upon
the
occurrence
of
the
conditional
event
the
contract
behaves
like
a
simple
event
contract
based
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
the
key
event
given
the
serious
discussions
that
joe
biden
may
be
replaced
by
gavin
newsom
or
another
candidate
and
the
lack
of
polling
available
to
assess
the
popularity
of
those
candidates
a
conditional
market
would
be
an
efficient
way
to
inform
the
public
discourse
concerning
this
possibility
for
example
a
market
with
conditional
event
newsom
is
the
democratic
nominee
and
democrat
party
to
win
presidential
election
would
generate
a
price
signal
which
would
inform
the
general
public
about
the
likelihood
of
various
contingent
possibilities
beyond
its
control
such
markets
are
relevant
to
all
americans
whether
they
support
the
democratic
party
candidate
or
not
those
who
support
the
democratic
party
benefit
from
knowing
which

them
the
best
chance

such
information
on

is
especially
relevant
when
faced
with
the
decision
to
potentially
replace
the
candidate
for
those
who
do
not
support
the
democratic
party
knowledge
of
which
potential
opponent
is
most
formidable
is
also
relevant
to
choice
of
their
own
candidate
as
well
as
to
better
understand
the
political
landscape
that
is
likely
to
impact
the

beyond
the
obvious
informational
value
of
such
markets
which
can
not
be

means
conditional

offer
a
powerful
and
currently

way
to
hedge
many
risks
that
may
arise
under

contingencies
the

of

the
participation
of
so
called
profiteers
and
gamblers
may
be
initially
viewed
as
contrary
to
the
stated
purpose
of
these
markets
the
involvement
of
participants
from
all
three
categories
is
necessary
to
the
healthy
function
of
any
market
wherever
a
market
exists
there
will
be
participants
motivated
by
profit
and
those
who
only
want
to
gamble
this
is
true
of
all
currently
regulated
and
operating
stock
commodities
and

markets
in
the
united

and
abroad
it
is
both
foolish
and
counterproductive
to
seek
to
limit
participation
of
such
individuals
or
to
disallow
entire
markets
because
of
the
possibility
that
such
individuals
will
participate
as
we
now
discuss
markets
can
only
serve
the
public
interest
if
participants
from
all
three
categories
are
able
to
trade
hedging
risk
and
aggregating
information
are
two
primary
purposes
of
event
contracts
with
clear
and
far
reaching
public
benefits
achieving
either
purpose
requires
a
healthy
demographic
split
among
the
three
participant
categories
above
a
party
wishing
to
hedge
risk
must
find
a
counterparty
willing
to
take
on
the
risk
being
hedged
the
example
in

describes
two
companies
whose
risks
cancel
out
enabling
them
to
trade
risks
on

outcome

election
in
a
mutually
beneficial
fashion
in
general
however
one
can
not
expect
that
the
risks
of
participants
will
align
so
perfectly
that
every
dollar
seeking
to
be
hedged
on
one
side
can
be
matched
with
a
dollar
seeking
to
hedge
the
other
side
there
is
often
an
imbalance
among
those
seeking
to
hedge
gamblers
help
to
resolve
this
imbalance
as
their
desire
to
speculate
leads
to
the
injection
of
the
additional
liquidity
needed
for
the
market
to
service
those
looking
to
hedge
risk
but
gamblers
and
hedgers
alone
can
not
serve
the
market
information
aggregation
purpose
profiteers
are
sophisticated
operators
who
often
have
access
to
better
information
and
more
reliable
pricing
methods
than
their
non
profit
seeking
counterparts
their
deep
understanding
of
the
market
and
precise
approach
to
trading
allows
them
to
trade
profitably
by
identifying
price
discrepancies
for
example
an
event
that
has
a
30
probability
of
occurring
but
for
which
a
contract
is
selling
at
offers
the
savvy
trader
an
expected
profit
of
for
every
invested
for
an
expected
50
return
on
investment
typically
a
trader
will
build
in
a
margin
of
safety
of
at
least
a
few
percent
so
the
price
will
not
reach
exactly
based
on
a
single
trader
activity
but
will
be
driven
upward
from
closer
to
the
fair

the
positive
internality
of
providing
additional

to
the

to
those
seeking

and
the
positive
externality
of
informing
the
general
public
many
of
whom
do
not
directly
participate
in
the

and
therefore
enjoy
this
benefit
at
no
cost
understanding
the
interplay
among
the

three
categories

response
to
commission
proposal
and
questions
we
now
address
specific
questions
from
the
proposal
1
the
commission
further
requests
comment
on
the
examples
provided
of
event
contracts
that
the
commission
believes
would
generally
fall
outside
of
the
scope
of
cea
section
and
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
following
questions
are
there
additional
types
of
event
contracts
that
should
be
explicitly
identified
by
the
commission
in
the
non
exclusive
list
of
contract
types
that
would
generally
fall
outside
the
scope
of
cea
section
and
what
indices
or
measures
are
other
macroeconomic
or
for
purposes
of
contracts
that
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
section
are
tax
rates
corporate
and
capital
gains
tax
rates
among
such
macroeconomic
measures
any
index
or
measure
that
is
correlated
with
a
pre
established
macroeconomic
index
or
measure
should
be
regarded
as
other
macroeconomic
or
for
the
purpose
of
cea
section
this
includes
corporate
tax
rates
which
have
been
shown
to
be
correlated
with
gdp
growth
in
a
recent
study
by
peterson
et
al
2022
2
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
proposed
definition
of
the
term
gaming
in
its
proposed
definition
of
gaming
the
commission
appears
to
bend
over
backwards
to
ensure
that
the
definition
explicitly
includes
certain
types
of
events
such
as
sporting
events
elections
and
award
shows
while
omitting
or
leaving
ambiguous
a
number
of
other
events
that
should
obviously
also
fall
under
gaming
by
any
common
sense
interpretation
of
the
term
for
example
the
proposed
definition
excludes
events
such
as
climate
related
or
other
natural
occurrences
on
which
staking
something
of
value
would
logically
constitute
gaming
by
its
vernacular
meaning
as
synonymous
with
gambling
at
the
same
time
the
proposed
definition
singles
out
other
events
such
as
contests
of
others
sporting
events
and
political
elections
which
are
categorically
indistinguishable
to
the
aforementioned
omitted
events
from
the
perspective
of
a
party
uninvolved
in
a
contest
game
or
performance
to
stake
something
of
value
on
such
a
contest
game
or
performance
is
akin
to
staking
something
of
value
on
a
natural
event
as
both
categories
of
events
are
beyond
the
control
of
the
parties
of
the
contract
there
is
no
logical
basis
on
which
the
two
would
be
treated
as
different
with
respect
to
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
it
is
further
worth
highlighting
that
eligible
event
contracts
so
called
excluded
commodities
are
tacitly
required
by
the
cea
to
involve
events
beyond
the
control
of
the
parties
to
the
relevant
contract
agreement
or
transaction
section
of
cea
therefore
the
singling
out
of
contests
of
others
in
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
is
redundant
to
the
eligible
class
of
contracts
under
section
by
this
provision
it
is
implied
that
any
event
contract
for
which
one
of
the
parties
is
involved
in
a
sporting
event
underlying
the
contract
can
not
be
approved
on
the
other
hand
a
contract
involving
the
same
event
but
between
two
parties
who
are
uninvolved
in
that
event
can
and
should
be
approved
per
section
regardless
of
whether
the
contract
is
determined
to
involve
gaming
climate
related
event
contracts
involve
gaming
or
do
involve
gaming
just
as
much
as
contracts
on
elections
or
sporting
contests
from
the
commission
perspective
therefore
either
both
should
be
considered
gaming
or
both
should
not
perhaps
the
commission
has
purposely
contorted
its
definition
of
gaming
to
exclude
climate
related
events
because
such
contracts
have
gained
the
commission
blessing
for
their
obvious
use
in
hedging
weather
related
contingencies
in
agriculture
and
farming
but
there
are
tangible
circumstances
some
of
which
have
been
highlighted
in
section
in
which
markets
on
all
of
these
events
climate
sports
and
elections
are
useful
for
hedging
risk
and
for
informing
the
public
about
events
in
the
public
interest
regardless
such
observations
about
hedging
are
irrelevant
to
whether
or
not
such
an
activity
involves
gaming
and
herein
lies
the
fundamental
flaw
of
the
commission
proposed
definition
an
event
contract
that
involves
gaming
can
nevertheless
be
useful
for
hedging
the
determination
of
whether
a
market
is
useful
for
hedging
risk
is
unrelated
to
whether
or
not
the
market
involves
gaming
and
by
the
same
token
whether
an
activity
involves
gaming
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
a
related
event
contract
can
serve
as
a
vehicle
for
hedging
the
commission
definition
therefore
must
be
reworked
to
accurately
reflect
the
common
sense
meaning
of
the
term
gaming
without
respect
to
whatever
ulterior
motives
the
commission
may
have
in
attempting
to
frame
the
narrative
about
specific
types
of
contracts
a
further
problem
with
the
commission
approach
throughout
the
proposal
including
its
handling
of
gaming
is
in
confounding
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
with
event
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
relevant
sections
of
the
cea
make
clear
that
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
and
those
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
are
not
one
and
the
same
the
act
merely
states
that
the
commission
can
only
disallow
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
provided
such
a
contract
is
also
contrary
to
the
public
interest
gaming
in
itself
is
not
automatically
against
the
public
interest
as
is
clear
by
the
wording
of
the
act
the
fundamentals
of
market
function
reviewed
in
section
and
the
mounting
data
of
voters
and
lawmakers
across
the
supermajority
of
states
in
which
sports
betting
has
been
approved
in
recent
years
the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
which
purposely
aims
to
include
events
that
it
seeks
to
disapprove
and
exclude
events
that
it
wishes
to
approve
further
highlights
the
commission
own
misunderstanding
and
misapplication
of
the
act
plainly
an
activity
can
involve
gaming
or
any
other
enumerated
activity
for
that
matter
and
yet
still
be
in
the
public
interest
if
this
were
not
the
case
then
the
legality
of
every
event
contract
market
would
be
in
jeopardy
as
all
event
contract
markets
involve
gaming
or
are
similar
to
gaming
to
some
degree
and
such
activity
is
necessary
for
healthy
market
function
see
section
there
is
no
evidence
of
manipulation
or
other
nefarious
uses
of
election
event
contract
markets
the
commission
raises
a
number
of
specific
concerns
about
the
offering
of
event
contracts
on
election
outcomes
specifically
the
commission
asserts
that
such
contracts
raise
concerns
that
conduct
designed
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
could
be
used
to
manipulate
the
markets
in
such
contracts
or
conversely
that
the
markets
in
such
contracts
could
be
manipulated
to
influence
elections
or
electoral
perceptions
proposal
54
this
claim
is
a
red
herring
not
supported
by
data
from
active
markets
involving
election
betting
over
a
period
of
decades
the
commission
voices
valid
concerns
about
influence
in
the
above
quote
but
the
concern
is
misplaced
to
the
contrary
election
markets
are
the
antidote
to
manipulative
practices
undertaken
by
political
parties
to
unduly
influence
the
electorate
via
the
media
and
other
means
the
fallout
of
the
first
presidential
debate
between
trump
and
biden
on
june
27
2024
underscores
the
point
while
political
operatives
within
the
democratic
party
leveraged
the
media
to
control
the
narrative
the
election
markets
on
predictit
betfair
polymarket
and
other
outlets
gave
the
public
an
insight
into
what
was
actually
happening
and
what
it
meant
for
the
upcoming
election
it
is
the
lack
of
election
markets
rather
than
their
existence
that
enables
widespread
manipulation
and
undue
influence
of
the
electorate
in
addition
to
iowa
electronic
markets
iem
and
predictit
both
of
which
have
operated
under
cftc
no
action
relief
election
betting
is
offered
by
a
number
of
entities
some
of
whom
operate
unregulated
or
outside
the
united
states
a
non
exhaustive
list
includes
intrade
smarkets
betfair
and
polymarket
therefore
although
the
commission
has
tried
to
limit
public
access
to
political
event
contracts
within
its
jurisdiction
such
markets
have
existed
and
will
continue
to
thrive
into
the
future
despite
the
commission
attempts
to
prevent
them
notwithstanding
any
legal
or
regulatory
issues
these
markets
serve
a
useful
purpose
for
evaluating
the
commission
concerns
over
election
markets
whatever
alleged
opportunities
such
markets
would
offer
to
influence
elections
or
electoral
perceptions
would
have
surely
been
realized
through
the
robust
offering
of
betting
markets
that
are
at
once
accessible
to
persons
but
which
operate
outside
the
commission
regulatory
jurisdiction
betfair
election
markets
for
the
2024
election
offer
a
timely
illustration
betfair
political
markets
for
2024
elections
as

2024
betfair
a

exchange
based
out
of
australia
offers
markets
on
a
variety
of
political
outcomes
in
australia
ireland
united
states
and
united
kingdom
the
largest
such
markets
concern
the
2024
presidential
election
so
far
the
total

of

much
more

will
be
traded
between
now
and
november
2024
when
the
election
takes
place
if
the
commission
concerns
are
valid
the
robustness
of
these
markets
which
will
have
matched
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
trading
by
the
time
of
the
election
in
november
should
offer
ample
incentive
for
manipulation
or
other
adverse
action
referenced
by
the
commission
in
its
proposal
the
fact
that
no
such
adverse
events
have
been
observed
over
several
years
of
offering
these
same
markets
indicates
that
the
threat
of
such
an
adverse
event
is
negligible
and
does
not
outweigh
the
many
more
significant
public
benefits
of
such
markets
the
commission
claimed
reasons
for
opposing
these
markets
are
not
supported
by
the
empirical
evidence
gaming
is
not
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
before
addressing
the
questions
below
it
is
important
to
reiterate
several
key
points
from
section
1
the
premise
of
the
commission
proposal
is
flawed
per
the
wording
of
the
cea
gaming
is
not
categorically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
therefore
when
we
respond
to
the
commission
questions
below
regarding
other
contracts
that
constitute
gaming
but
which
fall
outside
the
proposed
definition
of
the
term
we
are
by
no
means
suggesting
that
such
event
contracts
should
be
considered
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nor
are
we
endorsing
the
commission
proposed
definition
to
the
contrary
in
recognizing
the
many
event
contracts
that
should
rightly
fall
under
the
heading
of
gaming
we
call
attention
to
the
flaws
in
the
commission
frankenstein
of
a
definition
of
gaming
and
its
position
that
such
contracts
ought
to
be
regarded
by
default
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
following
questions
are
there
examples
of
activities
that
would
constitute
gaming
that
may
fall
outside
of
the
proposed
definition
for
this
section
we
assume
the
common
sense
definition
of
gaming
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
outcome
by
this
definition
event
contracts
related
to
the
climate
or
weather
would
most
certainly
involve
gaming
but
do
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
proposed
definition
as
climate
related
events
are
natural
events
that
do
not
result
from
a
contest
game
or
performance
therefore
event
contracts
involving
the
number
of
hurricanes
the
amount
of
annual
rainfall
in
a
specific
location
whether
a
magnitude
earthquake
will
be
detected
in
a
specific
location
damage
caused
by
wildfires
annual
snowfall
and
similar
such
events
are
intuitively
gaming
but
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
similarly
event
contracts
relating
to
prices
indices
interest
rates
or
other
macroeconomic
metrics
and
indicators
also
involve
gaming
but
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
proposed
definition
regarding
this
latter
case
we
note
that
such
prices
indices
etc
are
specifically
carved
out
for
approval
in
the
cea
this
does
not
however
preclude
them
from
involving
gaming
the
cea
makes
clear
that
gaming
is
not
inherently
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
some
in
fact
many
or
most
event
contracts
may
involve
gaming
to
some
degree
and
yet
still
serve
the
public
interest
other
activities
that
constitute
gaming
but
fall
outside
of
the
proposed
definition
are
legislative
outcomes
such
as
whether
a
particular
bill
will
pass
the
house
or
senate
or
whether
a
bill
will
be
vetoed
by
the
president
and
judicial
decisions
such
as
whether
a
specific
justice
will
be
in
the
majority
of
a
specific
supreme
court
decision
or
how
a
court
will
rule
in
a
specific
case
unless
the
commission
strains
its
definition
even
further
to
regard
the
passing
of
legislation
or
a
judicial
ruling
as
the
result
of
a
contest
they
are
proceedings
not
contests
such
events
would
be
excluded
from
the
definition
and
yet
to
stake
something
of
value
on
these
would
constitute
gaming
under
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
term
to
be
clear
the
offering
of
such
contracts
is
in
the
public
interest
just
as
the
offering
of
contracts
on
elections
sports
and
other
contests
is
in
the
public
interest
the
omission
of
such
events
from
the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
underscores
a
deficiency
of
the
commission
proposed
definition
rather
than
call
into
question
the
validity
of
markets
involving
such
events
are
there
other
types
of
votes
or
elections
that
the
commission
should
specifically
identify
for
clarity
in
the
illustrative
examples
in
proposed
what
types
of
other
votes
or
elections
should
be
identified
and
why
no
in
fact
the
illustrative
examples
specified
in
proposed
should
be
removed
as
they
unjustifiably
disregard
specific
event
contracts
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
the
availability
at
gaming
venues
of
bets
or
wagers
on
a
particular
contingency
occurrence
or
event
be
a
relevant
factor
in
the
commission
consideration
of
whether
an
event
contract
involving
that
contingency
occurrence
or
event
involves
gaming
for
purposes
of
no
the
availability
of
wagers
at
gaming
venues
is
irrelevant
to
the
commission
consideration
as
the
commission
decision
is
governed
by
the
cea
and
the
availability
of
wagers
at
specific
venues
is
governed
by
other
laws
and
regulations
which
may
be
incongruent
with
the
act
in
various
ways
however
the
availability
of
such
wagers
at
gaming
venues
should
be
considered
relevant
for
determining
whether
contracts
on
such
events
are
in
the
public
interest
widespread
opportunities
to
wager
on
such
outcomes
is
strong
evidence
that
the
public
and
the
legislatures
in
those
jurisdictions
have
determined
that
such
offerings
are
in
the
public
interest
in
taking
action
contrary
to
the
supermajority
of
state
legislatures
the
commission
is
asserting
that
five
unelected
commissioners
are
better
equipped
to
assess
the
public
interest
than
the
public
and
its
elected
leaders
the
existence
of
such
venues
offering
bets
or
wagers
on
events
that
involve
enumerated
activities
also
provides
a
straightforward
and
objective
way
to
evaluate
commission
claims
that
event
contracts
on
such
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
such
venues
offering
wagers
and
bets
on
such
events
are
widespread
state
regulated
sports
betting
offshore
regulated
betting
through
betfair
and
similar
operators
the
lack
of
incidents
involving
any
of
the
commission
perceived
concerns
about
manipulation
influence
or
negative
consequences
undercuts
the
commission
claims
that
such
contracts
pose
a
threat
to
the
public
interest
if
on
judicial
review
it
is
determined
that
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
does
not
involve
gaming
the
commission
may
consider
whether
that
activity
is
similar
to
gaming
is
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
similar
to
gaming
this
question
is
ill
posed
and
can
not
be
appropriately
addressed
until
such
a
judicial
review
were
to
take
place
as
the
reasoning
underlying
the
decision
to
exclude
political
contests
from
gaming
would
likely
be
material
to
the
determination
of
whether
such
a
contest
is
similar
to
gaming
however
it
is
worth
posing
the
obvious
question
if
the
commission
could
disqualify
political
event
contracts
on
grounds
of
being
similar
to
gaming
then
what
event
contract
could
survive
the
ever
widening
scope
of
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
and
its
all
encompassing
criterion
for
determining
when
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
broadly
defined
all
event
contracts
involve
the
risking
of
something
of
value
usually
money
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
some
future
event
as
such
events
may
not
be
a
contest
game
or
performance
there
are
many
contracts
that
technically
do
not
fall
within
the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
but
if
similar
to
gaming
is
taken
to
mean
risking
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
outcome
then
all
event
contracts
must
be
considered
as
similar
to
gaming
including
the
various
legacy
commodities
and
futures
contracts
that
are
currently
approved
and
traded
by
cftc
regulated
entities
the
end
result
is
regulation
run
amok
a
framework
in
which
the
public
interest
is
at
the
whim
of
a
fickle
regulatory
body
3
the
commission
may
also
consider
whether
it
should
enumerate
contracts
involving
political
contests
or
some
subset
thereof
as
contracts
involving
a
similar
activity
to
any
one
or
more
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
under
cea
section
and
determine
that
contracts
involving
this
newly
enumerated
activity
of
political
contests
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
are
contracts
involving
political
contests
contracts
involving
a
similar
activity
to
any
one
or
more
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
if
so
should
the
commission
determine
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
question
once
again
highlights
the
problem
with
the
commission
proposal
to
classify
all
contracts
involving
an
enumerated
activity
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
default
contracts
involving
political
contracts
do
not
in
general
involve
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
but
any
given
political
contract
very
well
may
involve
such
activities
even
so
the
involvement
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
in
a
political
event
contract
does
not
on
its
own
justify
a
determination
that
such
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
specific
circumstances
the
outcome
of
a
presidential
or
congressional
election
may
well
have
implications
for
the
declaration
of
war
or
the
likelihood
of
a
terrorist
attack
but
such
implications
do
not
on
their
own
raise
a
public
interest
concern
and
it
is
a
stretch
to
conclude
that
such
an
outcome
involves
war
or
terrorism
in
any
material
way
as
discussed
below
in
response
to
the
relevant
question
contracts
involving
war
terrorism
assassination
or
similar
activities
are
not
inherently
against
the
public
interest
and
should
not
be
categorically
disallowed
on
such
grounds
4
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
discussion
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
purposes
of
cea
section
the
commission
proposed
criteria
by
which
event
contracts
are
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
simply
by
their
association
with
one
of
a
few
enumerated
categories
is
inadequate
and
in
itself
fails
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
having
robust
and
efficient
markets
to
facilitate
hedging
risk
and
information
aggregation
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
must
first
clarify
in
what
ways
a
market
can
serve
the
public
interest
or
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
provides
no
explicit
examples
of
event
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
specific
reasons
opting
instead
for
generic
assertions
that
certain
classes
of
markets
are
offensive
and
have
no
place
in
cftc
regulated
markets
proposal
45
could
be
manipulated
to
influence
elections
or
electoral
perceptions
proposal
54
or
similarly
baseless
claims
that
are
refuted
both
by
logic
and
an
overwhelming
body
of
data
and
evidence
to
the
contrary
the
case
studies
discussed
in
sections
and
make
clear
how
event
contract
markets
involving
sports
politics
war
terrorism
pandemic
and
similar
such
activities
can
and
do
serve
the
public
interest
in
hedging
risk
and
aggregating
information
at
minimum
those
case
studies
invalidate
any
justification
for
the
commission
proposal
to
categorically
disallow
all
such
markets
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
is
conceivable
that
some
contract
involving
a
given
enumerated
activity
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
should
be
approved
according
to
section
then
the
commission
can
not
categorically
disqualify
all
contracts
involving
said
enumerated
activity
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
event
contract
markets
serve
the
public
interest
section
of
the
act
asserts
that
the
commission
shall
approve
any
market
or
contract
unless
it
is
expressly
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
section
provides
for
limited
circumstances
under
which
specific
markets
may
be
determined
contrary
to
the
public
interest
so
without
further
justification
that
takes
into
account
the
specific
aspects
of
a
given
event
contract
cea
defaults
to
the
assumption
that
event
contract
markets
are
in
the
public
interest
the
commission
determination
that
markets
involving
enumerated
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
contradicts
empirical
data
several
case
studies
showcasing
the
usefulness
of
event
contracts
for
hedging
and
aggregating
information
are
detailed
in
sections
and
these
case
studies
are
either
real
as
in
jim
mcingvale
hedging
case
study
and
the
predictit
price
signal
case
study
or
realistic
referencing
real
world
events
for
which
event
contracts
would
serve
an
obvious
public
good
by
contrast
the
commission
justifies
its
own
position
with
hypothetical
doomsday
scenarios
for
which
there
is
no
support
whether
the
commission
likes
it
or
not
event
contracts
involving
one
or
more
of
the
enumerated
activities
are
actively
traded
on
a
daily
basis
on
exchanges
around
the
world
whatever
supposed
damage
such
markets
would
supposedly
cause
in
the
form
of
manipulating
events
motivating
participants
to
violence
or
any
of
the
other
fabricated
reasons
given
in
the
commission
proposal
likely
have
already
come
to
fruition
because
of
these
existing
markets
yet
the
commission
provides
no
concrete
evidence
to
make
its
case
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
following
questions
should
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
be
considered
as
factors
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
why
or
why
not
yes
the
public
interest
in
these
market
functions
is
made
clear
throughout
sections
and
they
represent
significant
public
interest
benefits
with
few
if
any
documented
drawbacks
these
clear
benefits
raise
the
commission
burden
for
determining
that
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
order
for
a
contract
to
be
deemed
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
must
be
shown
that
the
negative
impacts
of
such
a
contract
outweigh
its
positive
impacts
it
is
not
sufficient
to
merely
raise
the
possibility
of
some
potential
hypothetical
or
remote
negative
impacts
of
a
contract
as
the
commission
has
done
the
contract
as
a
whole
must
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
the
vast
majority
of
contracts
including
all
of
those
discussed
in
case
studies
above
and
all
of
those
cited
by
the
commission
the
positive
benefits
of
the
hedging
and
information
aggregation
far
exceed
any
perceived
negative
consequences
of
offering
the
market
if
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
should
be
considered
as
factors
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
how
should
such
utility
be
assessed
if
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
are
factors
in
a
given
contract
then
in
order
to
determine
that
such
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
must
articulate
the
competing
factors
that
it
deems
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
further
demonstrate
that
the
totality
of
the
competing
factors
clearly
outweigh
the
totality
of
beneficial
factors
the
onus
is
on
the
commission
to
determine
a
satisfactory
and
transparent
protocol
by
which
to
make
this
determination
the
current
proposal
is
entirely
lacking
in
this
regard
are
there
factors
in
addition
to
those
described
herein
that
may
be
relevant
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
are
there
any
factors
the
commission
should
specifically
not
consider
why
or
why
not
the
commission
should
strongly
consider
the
importance
of
informing
the
public
about
significant
events
in
the
national
interest
and
how
event
contract
markets
can
uniquely
serve
that
purpose
for
a
number
of
matters
such
as
elections
public
health
emergencies
national
disputes
and
a
host
of
related
events
for
which
the
limited
information
or
conflicting
interests
of
the
government
and
media
often
gets
in
the
way
of
the
facts
the
commission
should
not
consider
the
manner
in
which
a
market
is
or
could
be
used
by
specific
participants
but
rather
should
consider
only
the
way
in
which
a
market
is
designed
to
be
used
much
of
the
commission
argument
for
categorically
classifying
any
event
involving
an
enumerated
activity
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
based
on
speculation
about
certain
market
participants
frame
of

about
which
the

event

the
public
relationship
to
traditional

steadily
over

what
exactly
has
caused
this

relationship
is
a

and
is
not

the
fact
that

the

states

markets
that
would

benefits
of

markets
on
a

range
of

unsubstantiated
harms
that
might
transpire
by

or

markets
when
determining
whether
to
approve

of

the

ought
to
bear
the
totality
of
consequences
both
positive
and
negative
in
mind
if
it
were
to
do
this
objectively
and
with
the
public
interest
in
mind
the
commission
would
find
that
the
vast
majority
of
event
contracts
are
a
net
positive
benefit
to
the
public
and

national

the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
proposed
public
interest
determinations
with
respect
to
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination
and
war
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
whether
there
are
contracts
that
may
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
that
do
not
raise
the
above
described
public
interest
concerns
why
or
why
not
there
are
sensitive
matters
surrounding
contracts
involving
war
assassination
and
terrorism
but
such
sensitivities
should
be
dealt
with
appropriately
not
by
simply
throwing
up
one
hands
and
regulating
an
entire
class
of
contracts
out
of
existence
as
the
commission
proposes
to
do
an
event
contract
on
the
assassination
of
a
specific
person
would
not
be
an
excluded
commodity
under
the
cea
because
any
of
the
participants
in
such
a
contract
would
conceivably
have
some
control
over
whether
such
an
event
occurs
such
a
contract
would
not
be
eligible
for
approval
under
section
similar
such
issues
arise
for
contracts
involving
assassination
of
specified
members
of
congress
or
the
judiciary
such
contracts
would
raise
public
interest
concerns
but
such
contracts
are
not
within
the
purview
of
the
commission
proposal
as
they
do
not
fit
within
the
definition
of
excluded
commodity
under
section
of
the
act
with
that
said
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination
and
war
do
not
as
a
category
raise
the
above
described
public
interest
concerns
the
reasons
are
articulated
throughout
section
1
and
highlighted
again
here
for
emphasis
as
long
as
the
underlying
event
be
it
war
assassination
or
terrorism
is
outside
the
control
of
the
event
contract
participants
it
is
an
excluded
commodity
that
is
eligible
for
consideration
under
the
cea
in
order
to
prohibit
such
a
contract
the
commission
must
explicitly
determine
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
case
study
4
in
section
and
case
study
4
in
section
show
there
are
clear
cases
in
which
markets
involving
such
activities
or
similar
activities
serve
the
public
interest
while
the
threats
of
terrorism
assassination
and
war
are
real
and
the
topics
themselves
are
sensitive
the
commission
can
not
simply
disregard
markets
relating
to
such
activities
as
distasteful
while
ignoring
the
significant
benefits
that
such
markets
can
offer
in
specific
circumstances
by
their
grave
and
serious
nature
acts
of
terrorism
assassination
and
war
are
very
much
matters
of
public
interest
whether
offering
an
event
contract
market
on
a
specific
such
outcome
adequately
serves
the
national
and
public
interest
requires
the
commission
consideration
in
particular
as
it
relates
to
the
purpose
of
event
contract
markets
accurate
and
trustworthy
sources
of
information
about
such
matters
are
often
hard
to
come
by
such
markets
would
be
immensely
valuable
for
informing
the
public
in
moments
of
true
crisis
especially
on
matters
of
public
health
and
national
security
also
by
the
nature
of
such
events
almost
every
individual
and
business
is
exposed
to
their
risks
without
any
recourse
to
hedge
those
risks
at
present
public
interest
in
event
contracts

for
a
concrete

a
market
can
profit
from
devastating
events
there
is
nothing
any
single
participant
can
do
to
advance
that
outcome
the
spread
of
covid
is
beyond
the
control
of
any
one
individual
one
person
can
not
cause
to
become
a
global
pandemic
so
while
it
may
not
sit
well
with
the
commission
that
a
person
could
profit
from
such
a
devastating
event
the
potential
public
benefits
of
such
a
market
which
are
enjoyed
by
hundreds
of
millions
of
americans
far
outweigh
these
otherwise
isolated
concerns
as
the
commission
is
also
surely
aware
such
widespread
public
benefits
of
markets
can
not
be
realized
without
the
possibility
that
some
participants
will
profit
at
the
expense
of
others
that
simply
how
and
why
markets
work
as
they
do
the
potential
negative
consequences
of
such
markets
are
isolated
to
individual
participants
whereas
the
potential
positive
benefits
are
widespread
for
an
event
such
as
the
covid
pandemic
the
commission
overlooks
the
possibility
that
such
a
market
could
mitigate
or
prevent
the
possibility
of
the
very
event
it
concerns
suppose
for
example
that
the
market
under
consideration
above
concerning
whether
who
will
declare
covid
a
pandemic
traded
at
for
yes
as
of
january
2020
note
that
this
is
a
purely
hypothetical
price
scenario
because
this
market
had
not
yet
been
offered
at
the
time
it
is
impossible
to
know
what
the
market
price
would
have
been
as
of
january
2020
at
the
same
time
the
official
announcements
of
the
government
insisted
that
the
threat
to
the
general
public
was
low
not
until
mid
march
did
the
government
take
action
to
stop
the
spread
of
within
the
if
such
a
market
were
to
exist
in
january
2020
however
the
general
public
would
have
had
an
outlet
for
obtaining
more
accurate
information
two
months
before
the
delayed
government
response
thanks
to
the
information
aggregated
by
such
a
market
tens
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
covid
deaths
could
have
been
prevented
such
a
possibility
raises
an
important
question
for
the
commission
does
the
potential
of
saving
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
lives
not
outweigh
senator
lincoln
concern
that
some
participants
might
gamble
through
futures
markets
or
profit
from
a
devastating
event
the
same
rationale
applies
to
the
consideration
of
whether
other
markets
on
war
assassination
terrorism
etc
should
be
permitted
is
the
stability
afforded
by
enabling
businesses
to
hedge
against
the
inevitable
instability
of
such
an
event
not
in
the
public
interest
is
the
efficiency
and
accuracy
of
information
transmitted
through
such
markets
about
events
of
grave
national
and
international
importance
not
in
the
public
interest
does
the
possibility
of
preserving
billions
if
not
trillions
of
dollars
in
economic
value
and
hundreds
of
thousands
if
not
millions
of
lives
not
far
outweigh
the
isolated
and
inconsequential
possibility
that
a
handful
of
participants
could
profit
from
such
a
devastating
event
viewed
another
way
is
preventing
a
handful
of
participants
from
profiting
from
a
devastating
event
worth
risking
the
trillions
of
dollars
and
millions
of
lives
that
a
related
event
contract
market
could
save

the
above

concerns
why
or
why
not
the
commission
public
interest
determination
with
respect
to
contracts
involving

is
flawed
to
its
core
event
contracts
do
not
raise
public
interest
concerns
as
a
simple
matter
of
involving
gaming
moreover
the
public
interest
concerns
raised
by
the
commission
do
not
reflect
the
reality
of
such
markets
these
concerns
are
instead
based
on
hypothetical
scenarios
for
which
there
is
no
direct
observation
in
the
various
markets
that
exist
and
which
would
fall
under
the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
public
sentiment
towards
gambling
has
shifted
dramatically
since
2010
in
2018
the
supreme
court
overruled
the
professional
and
amateur
sports
protection
act
paspa
which
had
previously
outlawed
sports
betting
nationwide
with
a
few
exceptions
since
the
2018
repeal
of
paspa
38
states
have
voted
to
legalize
sports
betting
beyond
sports
betting
gambling
is
currently
legal
in
some
form
in
48
states
all
except
hawaii
and
utah
the
commission
makes
frequent
reference
to
the
2010
colloquy
and
in
particular
senator
lincoln
statements
against
gambling
through
futures
markets
at
the
time
of
senator
lincoln
statement
sports
betting
was
illegal
nationwide
due
to
paspa
and
a
reasonable
position
due
to
its
illegality
may
have
been
that
gambling
particularly
on
sports
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
virtue
of
these
laws
we
note
however
that
the
oft
cited
quote
to
senator
lincoln
dates
to
well
before
the
much
more
recent
and
ongoing
movement
of
gambling
legalization
that
is
sweeping
across
the
country
with
the
repeal
of
paspa
sports
betting
is
no
longer
illegal
and
state
legislatures
have
taken
swift
action
to
legalize
sports
betting
within
their
borders
as
of
june
2024
a
supermajority
of
states
38
in
total
have
voted
to
legalize
sports
betting
source
so
while
the
public
interest
argument
against
sports
betting
and
related
event
contracts
may
have
been
justified
such
an
argument
no
longer
passes
muster
as
the
general
public
and
lawmakers
across
38
states
have
made
clear
that
legal
and
regulated
sports
betting
is
in
the
public
interest
to
argue
that
event
contracts
on
sporting
contests
are
against
the
public
interest
is
to
argue
that
the
overwhelming
majority
of
citizens
are
ill
equipped
to
determine
their
own
interests
such
a
task
is
reserved
for
the
five
unelected
cftc
commissioners
gaming
is
not
inherently
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
may
argue
that
markets
existing
purely
for
purposes
of
gambling
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
proposal
goes
even
farther
in
suggesting
that
any
contract
deemed
to
involve
gaming
or
be
similar
to
gaming
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
overwhelming
preponderance
of
data
rejects
the
commission
stance
to
the
contrary
the
fact
that
gambling
is
currently
legal
in
some
form
in
48
states
all
except
hawaii
and
utah
is
an
explicit
expression
by
the
citizens
and
lawmakers
of
those
states
in
the
belief
that
gambling
is
in
the
public
interest
and
as
the
interplay
between
hedgers
profiteers
and
gamblers
described
in
section
makes
clear
some
amount
of
gambling
is
essential
to
the
healthy
function
of
markets
on
that
note
by
the
commission
own
draconian
stance
all
of
its
currently
approved
markets
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
all
of
its
markets
somehow
involve
gambling
or
something
similar
the
markets
could
not
operate
otherwise
the
proclivities
and
motivations
of
specific
event
contract
participants
can
not
be
used
to
evaluate
whether
that
contract
serves
the
public
interest
overall
when
considering
whether
a
particular
event
contract
serves
the
public
interest
the
totality
of
market
dynamics
must
be
taken
into
account
additional
response
to
the
commission
treatment
of
gaming
below
we
address
several
specific
claims
made
by
the
commission
about
gaming
as
such
the
commission
believes
that
contracts
involving
such
occurrences
are
likely
to
be
traded
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
and
can
not
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
50
an
important
attribute
of
trading
in
general
and
event
contract
trading
in
particular
is
that
market
participants
buyers
and
sellers
do
not
have
to
explain
why
they
choose
to
buy
and
sell
this
aspect
of
market
participation
is
critical
to
the
efficient
and
effective
function
of
markets
as
explained
in
section
market
participants
do
not
declare
their
motivations
for
trading
but
the
existence
of
traders
from
diverse
backgrounds
with
divergent
motivations
is
essential
for
markets
to
serve
their
primary
purposes
for
hedging
risk
and
aggregating
information
on
what
basis
then
does
the
commission
conclude
that
broad
classes
of
contracts
would
be
traded
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
can
not
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
the
commission
continues
moreover
the
commission
believes
that
an
individual
or
entity
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
may
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequences
may
also
be
more
likely
to
have
access
to
information
influence
that
could
be
used
to
engage
in
activity
that
could
artificially
move
the
market
in
an
event
contract
involving
such
occurrence
potentially
raising
heightened
manipulation
concerns
for
example
a
professional
athlete
or
coach
may
be
economically
impacted
by
their
team
wins
or
losses
but
may
also
have
access
to
information
for
example
about
a
team
member
health
or
a
potential
injury
that
could
be
used
to
trade
ahead
of
the
market
in
an
event
contract
involving
the
team
performance
further
the
athlete
or
coach
would
potentially
have
a
platform
for
example
access
to
media
combined
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regarding
the
team
that
could
be
used
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
there
is
no
evidence
that
such
attempts
at
manipulation
are
in
any
way
widespread
as
the
research
literature
has
demonstrated
the
few
documented
attempts
to
manipulate
election
markets
have
in
fact
only
served
to
make
those
markets
more
resilient
see
cited
work
by
rhode
and
strumpf
such
is
the
nature
of
well
designed
markets
as
highlighted
in
section
and
also
by
hanson
see
citation
well
designed
markets
are
robust
to
manipulation
as
attempts
to
manipulate
market
prices
primarily
serve
as
an
injection
of
so
called
dumb
money
which
incentivizes
savvy
traders
referred
to
as
profiteers
in
section
increases
trading
activity
and
strengthens
the
market
pricing
signal
the
commission
go
to
example
which
highlights
so
called
insider
trading
concerns
is
a
red
herring
as
it
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
relevant
sections
of
the
cea
as
it
is
a
requirement
that
the
event
is
beyond
the
control
of
parties
of
the
event
contract
such
participants
would
not
be
eligible
to
trade
contracts
on
such
events
and
such
a
circumstance
is
not
within
the
purview
of
the
relevant
sections
of
the
cea
on
event
contracts
the
commission
further
notes
that
most
contracts
falling
within
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
would
have
no
underlying
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
directly
correlated
price
forming
information
rather
price
forming
information
is
either
nonexistent
or
driven
by
informational
sources
that
are
unregulated
have
opaque
underlying
processes
and
procedures
and
may
not
follow
scientifically
reliable
this
differs
from
the
informational
sources
used
for
pricing
the
vast
majority
of
commodities
underlying
commission
regulated
derivatives
contracts
government
issued
crop
forecasts
weather
forecasts
federal
government
economic
data
market
derived
supply
and
demand
metrics
for
commodities
marketbased
interest
rate
curves
the
lack
of
price
forming
information
for
contracts
involving
gaming
or
the
availability
of
only
opaque
and
unregulated
sources
of
price
forming
information
may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating
to
the
trading
and
pricing
of
such
contracts
while
decreasing
the
ability
of
the
offering
exchange
or
the
commission
to
detect
such
activity
the
above
claims
are
hard
to
address
because
to
quote
physicist
wolfgang
pauli
they
are
not
even
wrong
in
other
words
these
claims
are
so
off
the
mark
that
it
hard
to
specifically
identify
ways
in
which
they
are
wrong
but
here
is
an
attempt
to
reiterate
the
commission
core
claim
the
lack
of
price
forming
information
for
contracts
involving
gaming
or
the
availability
of
only
opaque
and
unregulated
sources
of
price
forming
information
may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating
to
the
trading
and
pricing
of
such
contracts
while
decreasing
the
ability
of
the
offering
exchange
or
the
commission
to
detect
such
activity
indeed
the
points
raised
as
concerns
by
the
commission
are
in
fact
reasons
for
why
such
markets
offer
value
and
should
exist
regulated
robust
markets
are
most
valuable
in
the
situation
that
the
commission
describes
when
there
is
opaque
information
from
potentially
unreliable
sources
a
specific
point
made
by
the
commission
is
worth
singling
out
the
commission
calls
out
the
existence
of
only
unregulated
sources
of
price
forming
information
as
a
reason
for
why
such
markets
should
continue
to
be
unregulated
first
if
the
commission
concern
over
unregulated
markets
is
valid
then
it
could
easily
counteract
this
concern
by
approving
such
markets
for
regulation
second
as
such
unregulated
markets
are
governed
by
the
same
self
regulating
dynamics
as
those
described
in
section
the
commission
concerns
over
price
signals
derived
from
unregulated
markets
is
unfounded
in
fact
unregulated
markets
can
often
produce
more
reliable
price
signals
than
their
regulated
counterparts
which
can
often
suffer
from
market
distortions
caused
by
over
regulation
and
rogue
regulation
of
which
the
commission
proposal
is
a
prime
example
3
concluding
remarks
the
commission
proposal
is
riddled
with
fundamental
errors
about
event
contract
market
dynamics
and
the
various
ways
in
which
event
contract
markets
serve
the
public
interest
instead
of
consulting
data
and
paying
deference
to
the
public
interest
benefits
of
markets
the
commission
is
hung
up
on
remote
hypothetical
scenarios
oft
cited
but
rarely
observed
and
never
witnessed
to
any
consequential
extent
the
commission
raises
concerns
about
election
markets
highlighting
their
potential
for
misuse
and
abuse
if
approved
but
betting
markets
on
elections
already
exist
at
scale
see
above
discussions
on
betfair
and
none
of
the
concerns
posited
by
the
commission
have
come
to
light
elections
are
not
unduly
influenced
by
market
manipulators
and
nefarious
actors
on
betfair
or
any
other
exchange
elections
are
instead
unduly
influenced
by
political
operatives
whose
self
serving
narratives
are
allowed
to
spread
through
the
media
unchecked
against
the
signal
of
an
independent
objective
event
contract
market
like
elections
the
proliferation
of
legal
state
regulated
sports
betting
has
not
resulted
in
massive
scandals
to
the
degree
the
commission
projects
nor
have
such
scandals
arisen
from
markets
offered
on
any
other
topics
related
to
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
there
are
however
well
documented
instances
in
which
these
markets
have
served
legitimate
public
benefits
use
cases
as
detailed
throughout
the
above
discussion
and
in
sections
and
in
particular
so
while
the
commission
proposal
paints
a
grim
picture
of
a
world
in
which
event
contract
markets
are
widely
used
to
manipulate
and
unduly
influence
the
public
such
a
world
is
pure
fantasy
cooked
up
in
the
minds
of
commissioners
grasping
for
a
justification
to
starve
the
general
public
of
the
important
benefits
promised
by
markets
on
elections
sports
war
public
health
national
security
matters
and
numerous
other
topics
in
the
public
interest
all
available
data
and
evidence
which
are
cited
throughout
the
above
comment
and
are
plentiful
support
the
opposite
conclusion
that
event
contracts
by
and
large
serve
the
public
interest
with
few
isolated
exceptions
in
proposing
to
categorically
disqualify
entire
classes
of
obviously
beneficial
contracts
on
significant
events
in
the
national
interest
the
commission
is
penalizing
the
general
public
in
order
to
squeeze
out
any
possibility
for
misuse
given
the
many
public
benefits
of
such
markets
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
does
such
a
draconian
stance
serve
the
public
interest
is
it
appropriate
that
a
business
owner
wishing
to
hedge
tax
risk
should
be
forced
to
bear
the
burden
of
that
risk
because
of
the
remote
possibility
that
the
same
contracts
that
would
enable
him
to
hedge
might
also
be
used
by
some
participants
to
speculate
could
hundreds
of
thousands
if
not
millions
of
lives
in
the
united
states
and
internationally
billions
of
dollars
in
lost
economic
activity
and
public
trust
in
government
and
official
institutions
not
been
preserved
if
there
were
robust
and
widely
publicized
event
contract
markets
on
the
pandemic
as
early
as
january
2020
do
the
benefits
of
such
an
outcome
not
substantially
outweigh
the
concern
that
such
a
contract
would
be
traded
speculatively
in
fact
does
the
speculation
on
such
markets
not
increase
liquidity
and
incentivize
smart
traders
to
inject
useful
information
into
the
market
and
thus
provide
the
public
with
an
even
more
valuable
and
reliable
price
signal
indeed
this
is
precisely
how
and
why
markets
work
the
commission
portrays
speculation
and
profiteering
as
inherently
negative
activities
that
are
to
be
prevented
at
the
expense
of
any
benefit
no
matter
how
great
that
such
markets
provide
but
by
that
rationale
all
markets
would
have
to
be
shut
down
are
there
contracts
for
which
these
benefits
may
be
outweighed
by
substantial
costs
or
risks
to
the
public
or
national
interest
of
course
and
the
commodity
exchange
act
vests
the
commission
with
the
authority
to
disallow
such
contracts
from
being
offered
but
the
commodity
exchange
act
does
not
advocate
for
over
regulation
as
the
commission
proposal
would
be
accurately
described
as
a
matter
of
serving
the
public
and
as
a
matter
of
logic
the
proposal
must
be
rejected
in
its
entirety
and
replaced
by
a
more
thoughtful
and
even
handed
proposal
which
gives
due
consideration
to
the
public
benefits
of
event
contract
markets
and
the
potential
negative
consequences
to
their
disapproval
at
minimum
the
comment
period
should
be
extended
for
at
least
90
days
to
solicit
additional
information
about
and
allow
for
the
commissioners
to
research
the
substantial
benefits
and
use
cases
of
these
markets
comments
should
be
especially
encouraged
from
businesses
and
individuals
who
stand
to
be
most
impacted
by
the
commission
action
those
who
have
used
or
would
use
prediction
markets
for
their
predominant
use
