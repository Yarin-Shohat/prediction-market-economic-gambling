dear
chairman
behnam
i
write
to
express
concern
about
betting
on
the
outcome
of
our
elections
as
addressed
in
a
provision
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
proposed
rulemaking
betting
on
election
outcomes
can
incentivize
those
with
financial
or
political
interests
to
interfere
with
elections
and
poses
risks
to
public
confidence
in
our
democracy
notably
the
commission
has
previously
rejected
proposals
to
create
political
betting
markets
because
of
the
potential
negative
impact
that
such
bets
could
have
on
the
integrity
of
our
elections
including
declining
to
approve
one
proposal
to
permit
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
just
last
year
as
we
approach
this
year
election
allowing
betting
on
political
outcomes
raises
concerns
that
such
activity
would
motivate
targeted
efforts
to
manipulate
elections
with
disinformation
dark
money
and
false
claims
about
election
fraud
in
testimony
before
the
senate
rules
committee
election
experts
have
warned
that
disinformation
is
being
supercharged
by
emerging
technology
like
artificial
intelligence
that
is
already
being
used
to
deceive
voters
and
undermine
trust
in
the
functioning
of
our
government
national
security
officials
also
continue
to
warn
about
efforts
by
foreign
adversaries
to
interfere
in
our
democracy
and
we
must
not
give
them
another
tool
to
do
so
i
urge
you
to
fully
consider
these
potential
threats
to
our
elections
as
you
review
this
proposed
rulemaking
thank
you
for
your
attention
to
this
important
issue
sincerely
amy
klobuchar
