event
contracts
are
financial
instruments
that
entitle
a
purchaser
to
payment
based
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
a
real
world
event
like
other
derivatives
they
are
used
as
a
tool
to
mitigate
risk
for
example
consider
a
yes
no
contract
on
whether
a
major
hurricane
will
make
landfall
on
the
gulf
coast
a
hotel
chain
might
acquire
yes
contracts
as
a
hedge
against
closed
beaches
conversely
a
construction
firm
focused
on
storm
repair
work
might
buy
no
positions
as
a
hedge
against
lost
revenue
if
a
major
hurricane
does
hit
the
hotel
chain
will
receive
a
payout
if
not
the
construction
company
will
each
has
hedged
its
risks
3
this
case
involves
event
contracts
based
on
political
events
meaning
those
relating
to
the
composition
or
activities
of
government
political
events
carry
enormous
financial
implications
for
businesses
and
individuals
will
congress
pass
funding
legislation
before
an
impending
shutdown
will
the
epa
promulgate
a
new
limit
on
tailpipe
emissions
will
the
federal
reserve
cut
interest
rates
by
the
end
of
the
year
those
are
real
examples
of
event
contracts
offered
in
the
market
by
kalshi
and
others
for
good
reason
uncertainty
surrounding
these
events
poses
economic
risk
no
less
than
uncertainty
over
hurricanes
pandemics
or
oil
supply
4
beyond
their
economic
hedging
benefits
political
event
contracts
serve
the
interests
of
the
public
by
harnessing
the
unparalleled
power
of
free
markets
to
produce
high
quality
dynamic
predictive
data
they
offer
the

a
unique
window
into

perceptions
of

commentators
and

thus
often
cite
alongside

kalshi
operates
a
regulated

that
allows
members
of
the
public
to
trade
event

its
mission
is
to
create
opportunities
for
individuals
and

to

in
ways
previously
available
only
to
large

in
june
2023
kalshi
sought
to
list
contracts
contingent
on
whether
a
particular
party
will
control
the
house
of
representatives
or
senate
as
of
a
particular
date
congressional
control
contracts
those
contracts
do
not
involve
unlawful
acts
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
the
cftc
thus
has
no
power
to
prohibit
them
nor
are
they
in
any
way
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congressional
control
contracts
would
enable
hedging
against
economic
risks
associated
with
one
party
control
of
congress
and
their
fluctuating
prices
would
provide
useful
predictive
data
to
the
public
hundreds
of
public
comments
from
noted
academics
real
business
owners
and
former
cftc
officials
among
others
explained
all
of
this
8
the
cftc
blocked
kalshi
contracts
anyway
it
reasoned
that
the
statute
empowers
it
to
ban
event
contracts
whenever
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
would
amount
to
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
not
merely
when
the
event
underlying
the
contract
involves
such
an
activity
trading
on
a
contract
that
depends
on
the
result
of
an
election
the
commission
continued
amounts
to
gaming
and
may
also
violate
some
state
gambling
laws
because
it
stakes
money
on
a
contingent
event
having
found
the
congressional
control
contracts
subject
to
public
interest
scrutiny
the
cftc
concluded
that
the
contracts
fail
it
because
they
supposedly
would
further
no
economic
purpose
while
threatening
election
integrity
9
the
order
analysis
fails
at
every
step
it
contorts
and
misapplies
the
cea
text
ignores
its
structure
and
purpose
allows
a
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
and
engages
in
faulty
and
unsupported
reasoning
10
to
start
the
commission
amounts
to
test
bungles
the
statute
text
trading
an
event
contract
can
never
amount
to
terrorism
assassination
or
warfare
accordingly
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
the
provision
as
a
whole
is
to
read
the
cea
reference
to
contracts
that
involve
those
activities
as
focused
on
the
contract
underlying
event
for
example
the
commission
may
prohibit
a
contract
contingent
on
whether
the
president
will
be
assassinated
because
the
contract
underlying
event
involves
an
assassination
and
the
cftc
may
reasonably
determine
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
a
contract
to
pay
out
if
the
president
is
assassinated
on
that
common
sense
reading
the
congressional
control
contracts
are
not
subject
to
public
interest
review
because
partisan
control
of
a
congressional
chamber
involves
neither
gaming
nor
unlawful
activity
11
on
its
flawed
reading
of
involve
however
the
commission
found
that
buying
a
congressional
control
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
gambling
prohibited
by
state
law
because
purchasers
would
stake
money
on
a
contingent
event
which
some
states
define
as
gambling
but
buying
one
of
these
contracts
is
nothing
like
betting
on
a
game
of
chance
or
even
the
super
bowl
elections
are
not
a
game
they
have
real
economic
consequences
nor
did
congress
implicitly
empower
50
state
legislatures
to
ban
event
contracts
through
the
backdoor
just
the
opposite
congress
gave
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
preempted
contrary
state
law
12
the
commission
interpretations
of
involve
gaming
and
unlawful
cause
the
cea
narrow
exceptions
to
swallow
its
general
rule
if
the
cftc
may
ban
any
event
contract
so
long
as
buying
or
selling
that
contract
would
amount
to
illegal
gaming
and
if
illegal
gaming
includes
staking
money
on
any
contingency
the
cftc
could
prohibit
any
event
contract
based
solely
on
its
view
of
the
public
interest
had
congress
intended
to
confer
such
sweeping
authority
on
the
cftc
it
would
have
said
so
instead
it
authorized
the
commission
to
undertake
public
interest
review
of
event
contracts
only
if
they
fall
into
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
13
the
cftc
public
interest
analysis
which
it
had
no
authority
to
conduct
in
the
first
place
is
just
as
flawed
as
its
statutory
construction
applying
an
invented
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
dismissed
comments
from
economists
investment
bankers
and
real
business
owners
all
of
whom
identified
demonstrable
hedging
benefits
associated
with
the
congressional
control
contracts
the
commission
instead
improvised
heightened
requirements
that
fundamentally
misunderstand
how
risk
hedging
works
and
then
ignored
the
evidence
that
kalshi
proposed
contracts
meet
even
those
requirements
it
likewise
ignored
the
established
price
basing
function
of
these
contracts
and
it
followed
up
with
unfounded
and
implausible
speculation
about
election
integrity
as
if
businesses
and
individuals
did
not
already
have
significant
economic
exposure
to
electoral
outcomes
much
of
the
cftc
public
interest
reasoning
would
equally
condemn
most
event
contracts
once
again
that
approach
is
fundamentally
irreconcilable
with
the
statute
congress
enacted
14
at
bottom
it
is
undeniable
that
election
outcomes
have
consequences
for
everyone
they
play
a
pivotal
role
in
determining
our
collective
future
allowing
people
to
trade
safely
on
election
outcomes
will
give
them
the
freedom
to
protect
their
financial
interests
a
legitimate
market
will
also
yield
more
credible
and
transparent
election
forecasting
especially
relative
to
the
bias
of
polling
election
markets
offer
transparency
clarity
and
truth
equipping
americans
to
filter

nonsense

they

kalshi

built
the
protective

it

unlawful

corrupts

dramatically
expands

in

kalshi

the
cftc
exceeded
its
lawful

and
engaged

arbitrary
and
capricious

this

therefore
set

21
many
derivatives
contracts
are
tools
to
mitigate
risk
including
risk
associated
with
the
occurrence
of
events
event
contracts
are
the
purest
expression
of
that
concept
they
are
financial
instruments
that
specify
a
future
event
with
different
potential
outcomes
a
payment
structure
for
those
outcomes
and
a
date
when
the
contract
expires
these
contracts
typically
center
on
a
yes
or
no
question
whether
the
federal
reserve
will
cut
its
target
federal
funds

range
before
a

an

if

not
until
that
while
it
remains
uncertain
whether
the
underlying
event
will
transpire
the
contract
price
will
fluctuate
event
contracts
trade
on
a
centralized
exchange
similar
to
a
stock
market
their
prices
are
determined
by
market
forces
not
by
the
exchange
traders
can
buy
and
sell
a
contract
at
any
time
before
its
expiration
23
as
in
other
markets
traders
arrive
at
prices
for
event
contracts
based
on
all
available
information
at
the
time
if
new
information
arises
related
to
the
likelihood
of
an
event
the
price
of
a
contract
contingent
on
that
event
will
change
as
a
result
the
market
prices
of
event
contracts
reflect
real
time
probabilistic
beliefs
about
whether
the
underlying
event
will
occur
for
example
if
a
yes
contract
on
a
government
shutdown
occurrence
is
trading
for
and
thus
the
corresponding
no
position
is
trading
for
that
means
the
market
currently
believes
there
is
a
60
chance
the
shutdown
will
occur
and
a
40
chance
that
it
will
not
24
event
contracts
give
traders
direct
exposure
to
the
outcome
of
real
world
events
with
economic
ramifications
no
other
instrument
perfectly
captures
the
risks
inherent
in
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
an
event
for
example
a
trader
can
use
a
futures
contract
on
the
500
stock
index
to
take
a
position
on
whether
the
economy
will
grow
generally
but
that
contract
would
be
a
very
imprecise
way
of
addressing
whether
the
next
gdp
report
will
identify
economic
growth
above
a
certain
level
only
an
event
contract
on
the
next
gdp
announcement
would
do
that
25
like
other
forms
of
derivatives
event
contracts
thus
allow
businesses
and
individuals
to
hedge
against
risks
for
example
a
beachfront
property
owner
in
a
city
might
buy
contracts
predicting
that
a
hurricane
will
hit
that
city
because
the
payout
could
offset
economic
losses
the
owner
is
more
likely
to
incur
if
a
hurricane
hits
or
a
firm
in
a
regulated
industry
might
buy
contracts
predicting
that
a
very
aggressive
nominee
will
be
confirmed
as
its
lead
regulator
to
help
mitigate
the
risks
associated
with
that
official
adverse
regulatory
agenda
26
event
contracts
are
distinct
from
insurance
the
property
owner
in
the
example
above
could
buy
insurance
to
cover
actual
property
losses
including
from
a
hurricane
an
event
contract
would
instead
hedge
the
diffuse
risk
of
losses
associated
with
a
hurricane
including
property
damage
a
decline
in
airbnb
revenues
and
higher
costs
of
food
and
water
meanwhile
the
regulated
firm
might
be
able
to
buy
insurance
for
the
cost
of
legal
defense
but
an
event
contract
would
directly
hedge
the
manifold
risks
associated
with
a
hostile
regulator
27
beyond
economic
benefits
to
traders
event
contracts
also
generate
informational
value
for
the
public
as
their
prices
can
be
understood
as
a
collective
prediction
by
the
market
the
expectations
and
willingness
of
traders
to
put
their
money
on
the
line
form
the
price
which
reflects
the
market
view
of
the
odds
that
an
event
will
occur
prediction
markets
therefore
serve
as
high
powered
and
highly
effective
information
aggregation
tools
generating
crucial
insights
for
researchers
businesses
individuals
and
governments
and
the
resulting
data
about
the
market
perception
of
the
event
likelihood
can
be
used
in
turn
to
determine
prices
for
assets
whose
value
depends
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
the
underlying
event
political
event
contracts
allow
for
hedging
of
political
risk
and
aggregation
of
useful
predictive
data
28
politics
no
less
than
agriculture
weather
or
inflation
is
beset
with
uncertainty
and
given
the
many
ways
in
which
governments
influence
the
economy
political
events
can
have
just
as
profound
an
effect
on
a
firm
bottom
line
as
spikes
in
energy
prices
or
interest
rates
businesses
and
individuals
thus
have
good
reason
to
use
derivatives
to
hedge
political
risks
just
as
they
hedge
other
risks
and
no
financial
instrument
is
better
suited
to
hedge
risks
associated
with
political
events
than
contracts
that
reference
the
events
themselves
29
indeed
kalshi
has
offered
event
contracts
based
on
whether
certain
legislation
would
be
enacted
whether
certain
presidential
nominees
would
be
confirmed
by
the
senate
and
whether
the
federal
government
would
shut
down
all
of
which
are
political
events
that
carry
obvious
economic
repercussions
for
a
wide
range
of
businesses
and
individuals
30
like
other
political
events
election
outcomes
have
vast
consequences
for
businesses
and
individuals
to
quote
harvard
university
professor
jason
furman
the
former
chairman
of
the
council
of
economic
advisors
under

obama
congressional
control
impacts
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
ways
that
have
direct
economic
consequence
to
businesses
and
workers
this
risk
is
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
similar
risks
that
can
and
should
be
managed
using
the
financial
markets
31
large
financial
institutions
already
design
bespoke
derivatives
for
large
corporate
customers
to
hedge
against
these
risks
they
used
complex
structured
products
to
prepare
for
risks
associated
with
brexit
the
2016
election
and
other
world
changing
political
events
event
contracts
on
regulated
exchanges
like
kalshi
offer
the
same
opportunities
to
smaller
enterprises
and
individuals
32
political
event
contracts
also
have
other
benefits
researchers
public
organizations
businesses
and
governments
continuously
seek
information
about
the
likelihood
of
future
political
events
among
other
things
that
information
helps
to
determine
prices
for
assets
that
are
exposed
to
political
risk
but
traditional
opinion
polls
and
other
methods
of
measuring
public
attitudes
often
can
not
replicate
the
robustness
flexibility
or
neutrality
of
market
based
indicia
that
is
why
media
outlets
routinely
rely
on
political
event
marketplaces
when
reporting
on
political
developments
33
indeed
political
event
markets
are
already
widespread
the
best
known
example
predictit
is
a
futures
market
for
politics
that
allows

on

outcomes

the

shall

in

congress
amended
the
cea
to
prohibit
the
listing
of
certain
event
contracts
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
but
the
commission
authority
in
this
regard
is
limited
it
may
determine
that
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
only
if
the
contract
one
of
six
enumerated
activities
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
can
not
undertake
any
public
interest
review
unless
the
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
43
the
process
for
reviewing
event
contracts
therefore
proceeds
in
two
basic
steps
first
the
commission
determines
whether
the
contract
involves
one
of
the
six
enumerated
if
not
the
contract
may
be
listedperiod
second
if
the
contract
does
involve
a
listed
activity
the
cftc
may
determine
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
bar
its
listing
44
for
example
a
contract
that
entitles
the
buyer
to
payment
if
a
terrorist
group
carries
out
an
attack
on
soil
would
involve
terrorism
a
contract
contingent
on
whether
the
president
will
be
assassinated
would
involve
assassination
and
one
contingent
on
the
progress
of
russian
forces
against
a
ukrainian
target
would
involve
war
the
cftc
would
be
empowered
to
review
those
contracts
to
determine
whether
they
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
to
block
them
if
it
concludes
that
they
are
although
those
examples
may
sound
far
fetched
foreign
websites
are
currently
offering
contracts
on
among
other
things
will
a
nuclear
bomb
explode
in
ukraine
in
2023
congress
thus
had
good
reason
to
provide
the
cftc
with
a
means
to
block
these
dangerous
contracts
45
the
cftc
has
promulgated
an
implementing
regulation
it
provides
that
a
market
shall
not
list
for
trading
any
event
contract
that
involves
relates
to
or
references
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
or
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
an
enumerated
activity
that
the
commission
determines
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
17
46
the
commission
has
not
exercised
its
authority
to
determine
by
rule
or
regulation
that
a
contract
involving
any
activity
similar
to
the
five
enumerated
ones
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
as
a
result
the
commission
may
subject
a
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
only
if
it
involves
illegal
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
47
the
cea
does
not
authorize
special
scrutiny
of
political
event
contracts
or
those
relating
to
elections
congress
could
have
added
elections
or
politics
to
its
list
of
enumerated
activities
but
did
not

of

kalshi
is

sell

kalshi
utilizes
its
innovative
proprietary
technology

the
commission
unanimously
authorized
kalshi
to
operate
its
regulated
exchange
in

49
contracts
traded
on
kalshi
market
involve
events
that
run
the
gamut
from
economics
to
culture
climate
public
health
and
transportation
for
example
traders
on

platform
may
buy

of

hurricanes
that
will
form
over
the
atlantic
next
year
or
whether
china
gdp
growth
will
exceed

also
lists
contracts
on
political
outcomes
such
as
whether

whether

will

these
are

based
on

question
will
chamber
of

those
who

to

imagine
a
green
energy
start
up
worried
that
republicans
will
cut
subsidy
programs
if
they
gain
control
of
the
senate
in
2025
it
might
hedge
its
risk
by
buying
contracts
to
that
effect
of
course
a
republican
senate
does
not
make
it
certain
the
subsidies
will
be
phased
out
but
it
does
increase
the
risk
of
that
loss
and
the
event
contracts
would
hedge
against
that
risk
if
the
senate
elects
a
republican
president
pro

the
start
up
would
receive
its
profit
would
be
the
difference
between
that

the

many

attested
that
they

overall
the
comments
explained
that
congressional

contracts
and
similar
instruments
are
not
merely
legal
therefore
must
be

for

but
also
carry
significant
societal
value
the
cftc
issues
a
flawed
order
rejecting
kalshi

57
the
cftc
disagreed
on
september
22

the
cftc
issued
an
order
prohibiting

three

the
order
and
separate
statements
are
attached
as
exhibit
58
the
order
begins
by
reciting
that
the
commission
may
determine
that
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
contracts
involve
any
of
the
six
enumerated
activities
order
at
3
59
the
commission
found
that
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
involve
two
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
unlawful
activity
see
7
v
but
of
course
the
commission
did
not
and
could
not
find
that
elections
or
the
selection
of
a
speaker
or
president
pro
tempore
themselves
involve
gaming
or
unlawful
activity
rather
the
commission
reasoned
that
an
event
contract
those
activities
if
trading
in
the
contract
would
amount
to
gaming
or
illegal
activity
see
order
at
5
7
60
the
commission
then
declared
that
buying
or
selling
kalshi
contracts
would
amount
to
gaming
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
to
reach
that
conclusion
the
commission
relied
on
dictionary
definitions
and
state
statutes
that
broadly
define
illegal
gambling
to
include
staking
money
on
the
outcome
of
any
game
contest
or
contingent
event
at
8
61
finally
having
found
that
the
congressional
control
contracts
were
subject
to
public
interest
review
the
commission
determined
that
those
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
13
23
62
every
step
of
the
order
analysis
is
fatally
flawed
63
first
the
heart
of
the
commission
reasoning
is
its
implausibly
broad
and
shifting
interpretation
of
involve
the
commission
concluded
that
a
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
if
trading
in
the
contract
amounts
to
the
enumerated
activity
at
7
emphases
added
in
other
words
an
event
contract
need
not
be
contingent
on
the
occurrence
of
an
event
that
involves
crime
a
terrorist
attack
an
assassination
an
act
of
war
or
gaming
instead
a
contract
is
subject
to
public
interest
review
and
potential
rejection
if
engaging
in
the
transaction
would
amount
to
one
of
those
activities
64
that
interpretation
of
involves
fundamentally
misunderstands
the
statutory
structure
the
activities
enumerated
in
describe
events
that
underlie
a
contract
if
the
event
underlying
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
cftc
may
block
it
the
enumerated
activities
do
not
describe
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
itself
65
that
is
most
apparent
from
the
fact
that
trading
on
an
event
contract
could
never
constitute
an
act
of
terrorism
war
or
assassination
for
those
activities
the
focus
must
be
on
the
contract
underlying
event
to
justify
rejection
of
kalshi
contracts
the
commission
therefore
had
to
embrace
a
radically
different
meaning
of
the
word
involve
with
respect
to
two
and
only
two
of
the
statute
six
enumerated
activities
gaming
and
unlawful
acts
for
those
activities
alone
the
theory
goes
congress
referred
to
the
act
of
contracting
rather
than
to
the
contract
underlying
event
that
tortured
approach
under
which
the
same
operative
text
toggles
back
and
forth
between
two
inconsistent
meanings
over
five
subparagraphs
is
a
sure
sign
that
the
order
misconstrues
the
cea
66
second
turning
to
the
enumerated
activities
the
commission
again
adopted
definitions
that
statutory
context
forecloses
the
commission
reasoned
that
gaming
means
gambling
and
that
gambling
encompasses
any
wager
on
a
game
contest
or
contingent
event
at
8
because
those
who
trade
on
kalshi
contracts
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
the
commission
continued
that
act
of
trading
amounts
to
gambling
and
thus
gaming
at
10
67
but
especially
in
this
context
gaming
does
not
and
can
not
sweep
that
broadly
rather
it
refers
to
betting
on
games
and
especially
to
betting
on
games
of
chance
an
election
is
not
a
game
at
all
let
alone
the
equivalent
of
bingo
or
roulette
it
is
the
foundational
exercise
of
democratic
governance
unlike
games
elections
have
independent
and
meaningful
political
and
economic
consequences
68
as
a
group
of
distinguished
economics
scholars
including
a
nobel
laureate
told
the
cftc
in
a
comment
letter
an
election
prediction
market
is
no
more
gaming
than
traditional
financial
markets
including
commodity
futures
and
derivatives
markets
due
to
the
vast
economic
utility
of
the
contracts
69
the
commission
contrary
interpretation
fundamentally
upends
the
cea
entire
approach
after
all
every
event
contract
by
definition
stakes
money
on
a
contingent
event
as
a
result
under
the
commission
reading
of
involve
and
gaming
no
event
contract
would
escape
public
interest
scrutiny
that
would
render
the
remaining
enumerated
activities
entirely
superfluous
and
it
would
cause
this
one
narrow
exception
to
swallow
the
rule
flipping
the
statute
default
by
authorizing
cftc
public
interest
review
of
every
event
contract
70
similarly
the
commission
reasoned
that
trading
in
kalshi
contracts
would
be
unlawful
under
state
law
because
gambling
on
elections
is
illegal
in
some
states
at
11
12
the
commission
unlawful
activity
analysis
all
two
sentences
of
it
fares
no
better
than
its
approach
to
gaming
71
once
again
the
commission
jeopardizes
the
entire
statutory
structure
this
time
by
giving
states
veto
power
over
the
federal
regime
the
cea
preempts
state
law
in
this
area
in
favor
of
exclusive
cftc
jurisdiction
7
but
the
order
reasoning
empowers
states
to
trump
federal
law
and
effectively
ban
trading
in
event
contracts
merely
by
broadly
defining
gambling
indeed
some
state
laws
already
forbid
staking
money
on
any
contingent
event
see
order
at
8
so
in
this
respect
too
the
agency
interpretation
taken
seriously
would
shut
down
the
entire
national
market
in
event
contracts
that
is
patently
not
what
congress
intended
by
conferring
on
the
cftc
targeted
authority
to
prohibit
contracts
involving
war
assassination
and
the
other
tailored
categories
72
in
her
dissent
commissioner
mersinger
pointed
out
yet
another
flaw
in
the
commission
analysis
it
presumes
that
kalshi
contracts
are
premised
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
at
10
but
kalshi
contracts
do
not
turn
solely
on
the
results
of
any
one
election
they
turn
on
the
aggregate
results
of
all
relevant
elections
in
that
year
cycle
plus
the
chamber
previous
composition
plus
internal
party
machinations
as
recent
events
illustrate
internal
factions
can
prevent
even
a
majority
party
from
electing
a
speaker
at
most
congressional
control
is
highly
correlated
with
the
outcomes
of
many
elections
but
that
is
equally
true
of
many
event
contracts
that
the
cftc
has
never
derided
as
gaming
73
finally
having
decided
that
kalshi
contracts
involve
both
gaming
and
illegal
activity
the
commission
deemed
them
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
too
the
order
analysis
fails
the
standards
for
reasoned
decision
making
74
the
commission
began
with
an
economic
purpose
inquiry
found
in
no
statute
regulation
or
judicial
decision
at
13
it
claimed
the
economic
effects
of
congressional
control
are
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
warrant
hedging
or
price
basing
at
16
that
logic
is
demonstrably
flawed
on
at
least
three
levels
75
for
one
certain
effects
of
congressional
control
are
not
diffuse
think
of
a
consulting
firm
with
deep
ties
to
one
party
congressional
control
by
the
other
party
would
directly
harm
its
business
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
allow
it
to
hedge
against
that
risk
and
it
would
allow
others
to
more
accurately
determine
the
economic
value
of
that
firm
the
public
comments
are
full
of
real
examples
of
assets
and
markets
where
a
direct
link
to
electoral
outcomes
has
been
demonstrated
76
for
another
it
is
simply
wrong
to
say
that
diffuse
risks
do
not
justify
hedging
or
permit
price
basing
the
purpose
of
hedging
is
to
mitigate
risks
not
like
insurance
to
offset
precise
losses
that
is
why
award
winning
economists
submitted
comments
explaining
the
hedging
value
of
election
contracts
it
is
why
a
managing
director
at
a
leading
investment
bank
commented
that
he
regularly
assists
clients
with
hedging
election
risk
and
it
is
why
a
host
of
commenters
from
a
wide
range
of
industries
from
cannabis
to
green
energy
affirmatively
stated
they
would
use
kalshi
contracts
to
hedge
risk
for
all
of
the
same
reasons
the
market
ability
to
aggregate
information
about
the
likelihood
of
election
results
would
allow
that
data
to
play
a
role
in
determining
prices
for
assets
that
face
particular
political
risks
oil
companies
or
cryptocurrency
firms
the
commission
rejected
all
this
evidence
without
explanation
resting
on
its
own
say
so
in
the
face
of
concrete
contrary
proof
77
for
a
third
financial
products
including
event
contracts
are
often
used
to
hedge
diffuse
risks
consider
futures
based
on
a
price
volatility
index
vix
which
measures
expected
market
volatility
using
500
options
contracts
it
is
hard
to
imagine
anything
more
diffuse
but
volatility
is
associated
with
economic
risks
which
is
why
derivatives
are
offered
and
traded
based
on
it
including
on
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
a
large
and
well
established
derivatives
exchange
78
in
short
even
if
economic
purpose
were
a
legally
appropriate
inquiry
it
was
irrational
for
the
commission
to
subject
election
event
contracts
to
a
uniquely
higher
showing
of
economic
purpose
than
other
event
contracts
79
the
cftc
next
accused
kalshi
of
undermining
american
democracy
parroting
six
senators
who
submitted
comments
the
commission
intoned
that
the
contracts
threaten
to
profoundly
undermine
the
sanctity
and
democratic
value
of
elections
at
19
why
because
someone
might
vote
for
a
candidate
he
despises
in
a
quixotic
bid
to
swing
settlement
of
a
contract
on
control
of
congress
at
20
that
is
unsubstantiated
the
cftc
can
point
to
no
example
of
such
behavior
despite
the
prevalence
of
prediction
markets
both
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
it
is
also
implausible
why
would
anyone
buy
a
contract
favoring
a
party
they
oppose
and
then
bootstrap
that
purchase
to
change
their
voting
intentions
80
worse
yet
the
commission
warned
malicious
actors
might
spread
misinformation
to
manipulate
the
market
in
the
congressional
control
contracts
true
in
an
environment
with
unregulated
informational
a
free
society
lies
are
unavoidable
but
that
is
already
true
there
are
already
enormous
incentives
to
engage
in
political
dirty
tricks
the
commission
ploy
to
link
kalshi
contracts
to
the
bogeyman
of
misinformation
is
feeble
consisting
of
a
single
blog
post
expressing
about
fake
polling
companies
see
i
at
22
81
the
commission
supposed
fears
about
election
integrity
also
ignore
the
reality
that
businesses
and
individuals
already
face
economic
risks
associated
with
elections
political
spending
on
the
2020
federal
elections
reportedly
exceeded
14
billion
elections
matter
individuals
and
businesses
already
act
accordingly
allowing
event
contracts
based
on
electoral
outcomes
would
not
increase
the
risks
of
manipulation
if
anything
it
would
decrease
them
by
allowing
the
risks
associated
with
elections
to
be
hedged
and
the
existence
of
a
neutral
market
driven
measure
of
public
opinion
would
likewise
reduce
the
threat
of
fake
polls
and
disinformation
contract
markets
create
a
financial
incentive
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
in
political
discourse
and
limit
the
salience
of
any
particular
piece
of
fake
news
82
venturing
even
deeper
into
the
realm
of
speculation
the
commission
offered
a
final
reason
to
ban
kalshi
contracts
the
prospect
of
playing
election
cop
at
23
the
commission
fretted
that
approving
these
contracts
might
one
day
force
it
to
election
related
activities
potentially
including
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
at
22
once
again
the
commission
rationale
proves
too
much
the
cftc
already
regulates
countless
derivatives
markets
involving
commodities
over
which
the
agency
lacks
independent
expertise
or
authority
for
example
the
cftc
oversees
trading
in
futures
contracts
on
the
500
yet
the
commission
does
not
regulate
stocks
that
is
the
job
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
the
cftc
relies
on
to
prevent
manipulation
of
the
underlying
market
likewise
it
is
the
role
of
the
federal
election
commission
and
numerous
state
and
federal
regulators
to
supervise
the
integrity
of
elections
they
already
take
that
responsibility
incredibly
seriously
as
they
should
event
contracts
based
on
political
outcomes
would
not
somehow
change
that
or
thrust
this
role
onto
the
cftc
claims
violation
of
apa
83
kalshi
realleges
all
prior
paragraphs
84
the
apa
provides
that
the
court
shall
hold
unlawful
and
set
aside
agency
action
that
is
arbitrary
capricious
an
abuse
of
discretion
or
otherwise
not
in
accordance
with
law
or
that
is
in
excess
of
statutory
jurisdiction
authority
or
limitations
or
short
of
statutory
right
5
c
85
the
cftc
is
an
agency
under
the
apa
i
and
the
order
is
a
final
reviewable
agency
action
for
which
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy
in
a
court
i
704
the
order
represents
the
consummation
of
the
cftc
decisionmaking
process
with
respect
to
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
86
kalshi
has
been
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
by
the
cftc
order
and
therefore
can
sue
under
the
apa
i
d
702
87
the
order
exceeds
the
commission
statutory
authority
is
contrary
to
law
and
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
88
the
order
fundamentally
misconstrues
every
relevant
statutory
term
to
start
it
misconstrues
to
authorize
public
interest
review
anytime
trading
in
the
contract
would
amount
to
an
enumerated
activity
but
the
only
reading
of
the
provision
that
makes
sense
as
applied
to
all
the
listed
activities
is
that
an
event
contract
involves
illegal
activity
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
only
if
its
settlement
is
contingent
on
the
occurrence
of
such
an
event
the
events
underlying
the
congressional
control
contracts
do
not
involve
any
of
those
activities
89
the
order
compounds
its
error
by
distorting
the
two
enumerated
categories
that
it
invokes
first
it
converts
the
gaming
category
from
a
narrow
but
important
limit
on
using
derivatives
markets
to
bet
on
games
into
an
all
purpose
tool
for
banning
any
event
contract
second
the
order
construes
the
unlawful
activity
category
in
a
way
that
empowers
state
legislatures
to
dictate
the
legality
of
event
contracts
even
though
the
cea
preempts
state
laws
insofar
as
they
interfere
with
the
commission
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
derivatives
markets
90
the
commission
misreadings
of
the
cea
arrogate
authority
found
nowhere
in
the
statute
enabling
the
agency
to
review
and
reject
a
potentially
vast
array
of
event
contracts
indeed
potentially
all
of
them
any
interpretation
that
gives
the
commission
carte
blanche
to
reject
any
event
contracts
it
wishes
can
not
seriously
be
defended
as
consistent
with
the
cea
text
purpose
or
structure
91
the
order
again
employs
faulty
and
overreaching
reasoning
to
deem
kalshi
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
too
the
order
concocts
a
test
that
has
no
basis
in
the
statute
and
proceeds
to
misapply
it
ignoring
the
record
evidence
of
private
and
public
benefits
associated
with
political
event
contracts
the
order
traffics
in
rank
speculation
about
their
supposed
harms
it
offers
rationales
that
are
untethered
to
the
statutory
purpose
and
would
prove
far
too
much
92
the
cea
entitles
kalshi
to
list
its
congressional
control
contracts
for
trading
on
its
market
the
contracts
do
not
involve
any
of
the
activities
enumerated
in
and
are
therefore
not
subject
to
public
interest
review
and
in
any
event
kalshi
contracts
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
93
accordingly
the
court
should
vacate
the
order
prayer
for
relief
now
therefore
kalshi
requests
a
judgment
in
its
favor
as
follows
1
vacating
the
order
2
declaring
that
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
can
be
listed
3
awarding
reasonable
attorneys
fees
and
costs
plus
interest
accruing
thereon
under
28
2412
and
4
granting
such
other
relief
as
the
court
may
deem
appropriate
