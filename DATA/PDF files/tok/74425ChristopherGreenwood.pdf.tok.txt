in
my
capacity
as
manager
of
a
cpo
cta
fund
organized
to
provide
liquidity
to
and
transact
on
kalshiex
and
in
light
of
my
experience
curating
and
writing
rules
for
the
markets
on
predictit
from
2014
2019
i
write
in
support
of
kalshi
proposed
congressional
control
contracts
these
contracts
should
be
approved
without
hesitation
as
they
clearly
conform
to
cea
provisions
and
cftc
regulations
and
core
principles
the
economic
purpose
to
be
served
by
such
contracts
is
overwhelming
and
the
objections
commonly
presented
are
unfounded
the
cftc
rejection
a
decade
ago
of
similar
products
proposed
by
nadex
involved
a
fairly
egregious
misinterpretation
of
dodd
frank
event
contract
proscriptions
an
error
that
not
only
disqualifies
it
as
precedent
in
this
review
but
deserves
explicit
correction
as
part
of
the
commission
approval
the
commission
poses
the
following
17
questions
in
its
request
for
public
comment
paraphrased
for
brevity
1
do
the
contracts
involve
gaming
as
described
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
cea
these
sections
do
define
gaming
of
course
but
simply
prohibit
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
leaving
the
reader
or
regulator
to
figure
out
how
to
define
it
in
its
2012
order
prohibiting
nadex
election
contracts
the
cftc
relied
on
the
definition
of
bet
or
wager
in
usc
5362
which
includes
staking
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
and
the
cftc
then
judged
that
an
electoral
contest
qualifies
as
such
this
aggressive
interpretation
of
the
phrase
a
contest
of
others
plainly
does
not
reflect
the
commission
own
criteria
for
application
of
reg
if
a
political
campaign
in
which
multiple
candidates
vie
for
the
prize
of
election
to
public
office
qualifies
under
this
definition
surely
contests
such
as
the
oscars
emmys
and
grammys
in
which
candidates
vie
for
literal
prizes
likewise
qualify
yet
kalshi
has
previously
self
certified
and
listed
numerous
contracts
tied
to
these
contests
without
objection
by
the
cftc
furthermore
predictit
the
market
operating
under
no
action
relief
since
2014
while
neither
a
dcm
nor
an
sef
has
nonetheless
been
bound
by
the
product
proscriptions
in
reg
being
unable
to
list
contracts
tied
to
most
military
activities
outcomes
closely
associated
with
mortality
of
public
officials
etc
yet
predictit
has
successfully
and
without
issue
listed
many
thousands
of
contracts
tied
to
electoral
outcomes
notwithstanding
the
commission
recent
decision
to
revoke
predictit
no
action
letter
for
alleged
non
compliance
its
routine
listing
of
electoral
contests
clearly
did
not
run
afoul
of
reg
topical
prohibitions
2
should
the
commission
consider
whether
election
contracts
are
available
in
casinos
or
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
federal
law
grants
the
cftc
exclusive
and
preemptive
jurisdiction
over
futures
transactions
the
commission
should
resist
any
temptation
to
cede
its
jurisdiction
to
state
law
or
regulations
as
the
commission
summarized
in
a
brief
to
sdny
years
ago
cea
section
grants
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
regulate
transactions
involving
inter
alia
contracts
of
sale
of
a
commodity
for
future
delivery
7

provision

that
plain
meaning
is
confirmed
by
the
statute
legislative
history
which
says
that
regulations
issued
by
the
commission
preempt
the
field
insofar
as
futures
regulation
is
concerned
and
if
state
law
conflicts
with
the
commission
regulations
federal
law
govern
the
issue
of
federal
legislative
definition
of
gaming
is
discussed
in
question
1
3
do
these
contracts
involve
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
as
described
in
reg
and
section
of
the
cea
they
do
not
elections
are
not
unlawful
activities
the
lawfulness
test
plainly
refers
to
the
underlying
activity
events
not
the
lawfulness
of
listing
contracts
tied
to
their
outcomes
appearing
as
it
does
as
the
first
in
a
list
of
proscribed
event
topics
that
includes
assassination
terrorism
war
etc
4
in
determining
whether
these
contracts
involve
unlawful
activity
should
the
commission
be
influenced
by
whether
state
laws
permit
betting
on
the
outcome
of
elections
or
by
federal
prohibition
of
interstate
betting
no
because
as
discussed
in
question
3
this
is
simply
irrelevant
the
lawfulness
test
applies
to
the
underlying
activity
elections
not
the
listing
of
contracts
tied
to
such
activity
5
are
the
contracts
substantively
different
from
the
contracts
nadex
proposed
in
2012
such
that
the
commission
analysis
should
be
different
they
are
not
substantively
different
the
commission
analysis
should
be
different
not
because
the
contracts
are
different
but
because
the
commission
2012
analysis
was
incorrect
since
elections
are
neither
unlawful
activity
assassinations
acts
of
war
nor
terrorism
reg
offers
the
commission
only
two
even
superficially
plausible
bases
on
which
to
prohibit
election
contracts
1
that
they
constitute
gaming
addressed
above
or
2
that
they
fit
into
the
final
catch
all
category
of
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
catch
all
importantly
must
not
be
misinterpreted
as
anything
else
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
enumerated
several
specific
categories
of
undesirable
activities
presumably
because
it
feared
the
consequence
of
the
potentially
perverse
incentives
for
market
participants
to
bring
about
or
at
least
profit
from
such
outcomes
some
of
these
activities
however
have
notoriously
slippery
legal
definitions
the
united
states
has
declared
war
in
80
years
but
it
safe
to
assume
congress
meant
to
include
plenty
of
military
activities
that
fall
outside
such
a
narrow
scope
hence
the
catch
all
also
note
that
the
phrase
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
directly
applies
to
the
underlying
activity
not
to
the
listing
of
the
contracts
just
as
they
are
not
unlawful
elections
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
6
are
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
to
serve
a
hedging
function
provide
tangible
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedged
directly
by
the
contracts
according
to
fec
data
compiled
at
the
top
50
interest
groups
had
by
june
of
this
year
given
nearly
a
billion
dollars
to
congressional
candidates
for
this
midterm
cycle
alone
not
only
does
every
major
business
sector
have
a
demonstrable
financial
interest
in
and
hedgeable
exposure
to
the
congressional
balance
of
power
but
that
exposure
is
nicely
asymmetric
making
electoral
outcomes
especially
well
suited
to
the
risk
reallocation
function
of
futures
markets
oil
and
gas
agriculture
and
automotive
companies
for
example
steer
more
than
two
thirds
of
their
donations
toward
republican
candidates
unions
law
firms
tech
and
media
companies
on
the
other
hand
donate
overwhelmingly
to
democratic
candidates
7
are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
etc
the
economic
consequences
of
various
election
outcomes
do
often
affect
the
pricing
of
traditional
financial
instruments
and
their
derivative
products
but
attempting
to
use
such
products
to
offset
an
electoral
exposure
carries
enormous
basis
risk
the
whole
point
of
regulated
event
contracts
is
to
enable
market
participants
to
offset
their
own
unique
economic
exposure
to
discrete
underlying
outcomes
rather
than
attempt
to
construct
sloppy
proxy
hedges
from
products
whose
price
movements
are
affected
by
countless
additional
factors
8
is
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
used
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrated
need
by
likely
hedgers
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
used
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participants
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedging
use
for
any
emerging
product
category
it
vital
not
to
impose
an
unduly
burdensome
threshold
that
will
prevent
its
maturation
most
prospective
natural
hedgers
will
either
be
unaware
of
the
products
existence
or
be
reticent
to
manage
any
significant
degree
of
financial
risk
using
such
products
at
least
until
they
able
to
observe
a
certain
level
of
liquidity
and
price
stability
a
track
record
of
stable
exchange
operation
and
a
lack
of
settlement
surprises
arising
from
insufficiently
robust
rules
writing
it
should
be
sufficient
that
the
contracts
address
significant
two
sided
quantifiable
economic
exposure
among
natural
hedgers
even
if
the
related
hedging
demand
in
some
cases
may
presently
be
largely
theoretical
surely
the
majority
of
contracts
currently
trading
without
controversy
or
special
review
on
kalshi
would
fail
any
meaningful
hedging
percentage
test
but
that
does
and
should
disqualify
those
non
electoral
event
contracts
from
being
listed
9
should
the
commission
consider
contract
and
position
sizes
and
the
intended
customer
base
to
assess
hedging
use
do
small
dollar
contracts
targeted
at
retail
customers
have
hedging
utility
against
macro
level
national
political
events
does
whether
contracts
are
margined
or
fully
collateralized
affect
this
analysis
the
position
limit
is
an
artificial
constraint
that
while
surely
well
intended
unduly
constrains
maturation
liquidity
and
adoption
of
these
contracts
by
natural
hedgers
particularly
institutional
market
participants
however
targeting
retail
customers
does
not
constitute
a
hedging
mismatch
retail
customers
include
small
business
owners
homeowners
tax
payers
energy
consumers
medical
patients
and
investors
in
traditional
financial
markets
all
capacities
in
which
they
experience
meaningful
economic
exposure
to
federal
electoral
outcomes
and
other
macro
political
events
10
should
the
commission
consider
contract
design
and
payout
are
binary
contracts
useful
for
hedging
nonbinary
economic
events
binary
contracts
can
be
sub
optimal
for
inherently
non
binary
events
but
the
contracts
at
issue
in
this
review
involve
distinctly
binary
outcomes
which
of
the
two
major
parties
will
control
each
chamber
of
congress
as
for
non
binary
economic
events
already
traded
on
kalshi
like
target
interest
rates
gdp
growth
forex
rates
or
the
closing
value
of
an
equity
index
the
mismatch
between
the
binary
product
structure
and
the
scalar
nature
of
the
underlying
is
addressed
to
some
extent
by
the
listing
of
several
binary
brackets
representing
various
numerical
ranges
when
those
ranges
are
mutually
exclusive
the
application
of
margin
linking
contributes
to
better
liquidity
and
aggregate
pricing
coherence
across
the
several
brackets
11
do
the
contracts
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
better
visibility
into
the
probability
of
a
party
control
of
a
legislative
chamber
serves
a
significant
and
plainly
evident
price
basing
function
prevailing
tax
rates
closure
of
tax
loopholes
federal
spending
levels
and
priorities
sector
specific
subsidies
energy
policy
and
health
care
policy
are
among
the
more
glaring
examples
of
congressional
agenda
items
that
can
be
reliably
expected
to
differ
drastically
depending
on
which
party
holds
the
gavels
decisions
as
major
as
a
multi
billion
dollar
and
project
finance
transactions
and
as
minor
as
whether
to
purchase
an
electric
vehicle
or
install
solar
panels
on
a
home
all
incorporate
a
series
of
assumptions
about
future
federal
policy
the
prospects
of
which
are
closely
tied
to
the
identity
of
the
majority
party
awareness
of
shifting
odds
of
a
particular
favorable
or
adverse
treatment
that
is
anticipated
to
correlate
strongly
with
the
party
in
power
will
naturally
enable
more
reliable
pricing
across
a
wide
range
of
transactions
12
are
the
proposed
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
on
the
contrary
just
as
every
other
category
of
regulated
commodity
futures
enables
the
efficient
reallocation
of
risk
so
too
do
event
contracts
so
long
as
a
wide
array
of
prospective
market
participants
are
asymmetrically
economically
exposed
to
the
underlying
events
electoral
outcomes
clearly
meet
this
test
13
could
the
trading
of
these
or
other
political
control
or
election
based
contracts
affect
the
integrity
or
the
perception
of
integrity
of
elections
a
common
argument
against
bringing
electoral
contracts
on
exchange
holds
that
the
existence
of
such
markets
is
somehow
corrosive
to
election
integrity
but
this
amounts
to
little
more
than
a
knee
jerk
reaction
to
any
novel
intersection
between
money
and
politics
ironically
the
wholly
uncontroversial
to
the
point
of
being
clichéd
idea
that
money
is
a
corrosive
force
in
politics
is
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
in
favor
of
listing
electoral
outcomes
on
regulated
exchanges
so
universal
and
overwhelming
is
the
exposure
of
virtually
every
commercial
concern
including
small
business
and
households
to
electoral
outcomes
that
countless
commercial
entities
shovel
as
much
money
as
legally
permissible
at
times
perhaps
more
at
the
candidates
and
parties
they
feel
pose
less
threat
of
enacting
adverse
policy
changes
what
better
way
to
reduce
that
pernicious
imperative
than
to
offer
a
more
sanitized
transparent
duly
regulated
mechanism
through
which
market
participants
can
offset
such
unwanted
exposure
with
no
attending
influence
over
candidates
and
elected
officials
14
could
the
contracts
facilitate
violations
of
campaign
finance
laws
for
example
could
the
contracts
make
it
easier
to
sidestep
prohibitions
governing
coordination
between
candidate
campaign
committees
and
pacs
such
coordination
prohibitions
are
already
trivially
easy
to
sidestep
and
need
no
assistance
from
the
futures
markets
it
not
clear
that
the
existence
of
such
markets
offers
any
novel
or
more
clandestine
means
by
which
to
coordinate
15
do
the
contracts
present
special
considerations
with
respect
to
susceptibility
to
manipulation
or
surveillance
could
candidate
campaign
committees
or
pacs
manipulate
the
contracts
by
trading
on
internal
non
public
polling
data
yes
these
contracts
should
by
exchange
rule
forbid
trading
by
certain
enumerated
parties
to
include
at
a
minimum
federal
policymakers
legislators
regulators
and
judges
and
their
staffs
candidates
and
their
staffs
and
registered
campaign
committees
and
pacs
16
should
campaign
committees
pacs
candidates
entities
subjected
to
fec
oversight
and
those
likely
to
hold
non
public
information
be
prohibited
from
participating
yes
17
what
other
factors
should
the
commission
consider
in
determining
whether
these
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
none
under
