its

the

welcomes
the

is
a
critical
tool
for
the

to
engage
with

and
gauge
the

on

are

are
also

the

unique

was
signed
into

which
led
to
the
near
immediate
establishment
of
the

that
legislative
accomplishment
this
committee
and
the

swiftly
responded
to

that
arose
on

technological

overseeing

which
rests
on

us
of
the

commitment
to

responsible
innovation
is
in
the

and
provides
market
participants
with
hedging
and

opportunities
they
would
not
otherwise
have
event
contracts
that
are
the
subject
of
this
proposed

are
yet
another
iteration
of
this
endeavor
event
contracts
have
broad
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
and
social
value
as
detailed
by
the
scores
and
scores
of
public
comments
from
retail
customers
small
businesses
and
leading
members
of
industry
that
informed
the
commission
of
how
they
would
use
event
contracts
such
as
our
congressional
control
contract
that
the
commission
prohibited
the
commission
decision
should
consider
the
full
weight
of
evidence
that
it
has
been
provided
with
on
event
contracts
including
both
of
kalshi
election
contracts
congress
and
control
and
the
public
comments
that
the
cftc
voluntarily
solicited
there
are
reams
of
evidence
from
academic
research
market
testimony
and
the
actual
data
and
experience
of
other
event
contracts
markets
running
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
after
considering
all
of
this
evidence
there
is
only
one
reasonable
determination
the
commission
can
make
that
the
event
contracts
that
are
the
subject
of
this
proposal
are
allowed
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
and
affirmatively
advance
as
the
cea
mission
reminds
us
the
national
public
interest
by
providing
a
means
for
managing
and
assuming
price
risks
discovering
prices
or

facilities
the
cftc
interpretation
of
the
scope
of
inquiry
under
the
statute
and
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
we
begin
with
the
statutory
text
of
section
of
the
cea
which
is
the
statute
that
the
cftc
is
proposing
rules
under
that
section
of
the
cea
states
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
levels
of
a
commodity
described
in
section
2
of
this
title
by
a
designated
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
i
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
emphases
added
if
the
commission
determines
that
such
an
agreement
contract
or
transaction
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
agreement
contract
or
transaction
may
not
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
section
further
specifies
that
agreement
contract
or
transaction
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
clause
i
may
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
thus
the
cea
through
this
provision
establishes
a
clear
framework
under
which
the
commission
can
but
is
not
obligated
to
review
an
event
contract
that
is
based
upon
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
that
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
underlying
activities
in
order
to
determine
if
those
contracts
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
commission
determination
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
would
render
its
listing
prohibited
in
short
through
section
congress
granted
the
commission
the
discretion
to
determine
that
a
given
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thereby
prohibited
only
when
the
event
underlying
that
contract
involves
one
of
the
statute
specifically
enumerated
activities
congress
did
not
grant
the
commission
the
authority
to
prohibit
a
contract
on
an
event
that
involves
an
unenumerated
activity
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
lack
of
authority
includes
the
sixth
enumerated
activity
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
that
provision
requires
the
commission
to
conduct
a
rulemaking
to
determine
that
another
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
then
only
if
it
is
similar
to
one
of
the
other
specified
underlying
activities
crimes
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
the
key
question
here
requires
understanding
the
limitations
on
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
is
the
scope
1
limited
to
contracts
when
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
or
do
they
2
include
the
act
of
participating
in
the
contract
is
itself
applying
the
principles
of
statutory
and
regulatory
construction
shows
that
section
and
rule
are
limited
to
only
the
underlying
activity
not
participating
in
the
contract
itself
and
because
kalshi
political
control
contracts
do
not
match
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
which
the
statute
is
expressly
limited
to
those
contracts
are
not
subject
to
the
statute
and
implementing
regulation
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute
there
are
several
terms
that
are
key
to
understanding
the
framework
that
congress
created
for
the
special
rule
that
appear
throughout
this
comment
and
are
helpful
to
define
here
event
contracts
the
event
contract
event
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
an
event
contract
is
a
contract
that
is
based
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
for
example
a
contract
whose
terms
and
conditions
specify
that
the
holder
of
the
contract
will
receive
payment
based
on
the
occurrence
of
a
hurricane
is
an
event
contract
because
it
is
based
on
an
occurrence
a
hurricane
an
elections
contract
is
an
event
contract
because
it
is
based
on
an
occurrence
the
election
a
contract
event
refers
to
the
specific
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
on
which
the
contract
is
based
a
hurricane
contract
event
is
the
hurricane
the
phrase
contract
considered
as
a
whole
which
is
what
the
cftc
has
proposed
to
be
the
sphere
of
its
inquiry
refers
to
a
broad
view
of
a
contract
and
all
factors
that
surround
the
contract
for
example
this
could
include
the
market
activity
of
buying
and
selling
the
contract
the
information
embedded
in
the
contract
pricing
and
in
the
case
of
an
event
contract
the
contract
event
general
background
on
the
cea
special
rule
under
the
cea
contract
listing
is
not
a
permission
regime
contracts
do
not
need
commission
approval
to
be
listed
and
although
the
cea
provides
a
mechanism
that
exchanges
may
utilize
to
put
a
contract
before
the
commission
for
approval
whether
or
not
to
utilize
that
method
is
solely
in
an
exchange
discretion
this
process
is
set
forth
in
17
which
the
commission
titled
voluntary
submission
of
new
products
for
commission
review
and
approval
indeed
the
overwhelmingly
vast
majority
of
contracts
are
never
presented
to
the
commission
for
approval
under
this
mechanism
even
in
those
rare
instances
when
the
commission
is
formally
presented
with
a
contract
for
approval
the
commission
discretion
over
whether
to
grant
or
withhold
approval
is
limited
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations
the
commission
must
approve
every
contract
that
does
not
violate
the
cea
or
the
regulations
7
17
the
commission
was
not
granted
authority
to
conduct
a
is
this
a
contract
that
i
am
comfortable
with
analysis
and
the
commission
was
not
granted
authority
to
disapprove
a
contract
because
it
does
not
like
it
the
commission
was
also
not
granted
the
authority
to
prohibit
any
contract
on
the
grounds
that
it
violates
the
public
interest
there
is
one
exception
to
this
rule
where
congress
did
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
prohibit
a
contract
that
the
commission
determines
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
be
clear
even
if
argunedo
the
special
rule
applied
to
the
contract
which
it
does
not
the
special
rule
would
still
not
prohibit
the
contract
because
it
is
in
the
public
interest
and
therefore
certainly
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
exception
is
the
special
rule
in
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
7
this
special
rule
gives
the
commission
discretion
to
consider
for
very
specific
types
of
contracts
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
special
rule
the
first
are
the
special
rule
eligibility
requirements
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
all
contracts
it
only
applies
to
a
specifically
defined
subset
of
contracts
that
are
eligible
for
the
special
rule
once
a
contract
is
eligible
for
the
special
rule
it
is
not
automatically
prohibited
the
special
rule
only
prohibits
contracts
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
second
second
aspect
of
the
special
rule
is
determining
whether
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
laid
out
the
process
for
the
special
rule
in
three
steps
the
four
steps
of
the
special
rule
there
are
four
steps
for
the
special
rule
step
one
of
the
special
rule
step
one
is
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
without
the
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
being
listed
there
is
nothing
further
to
do
step
two
of
the
special
rule
step
two
is
to
determine
if
the
contract
is
eligible
for
the
special
rule
the
statute
limits
the
scope
of
the
special
rule
to
contracts
that
are
based
upon
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
collectively
event
in
other
words
to
be
eligible
for
the
special
rule
a
contract
must
be
based
on
an
event
an
event
contract
if
a
contract
is
not
an
event
contract
it
is
not
eligible
for
the
special
rule
and
the
contract
fails
step
two
the
analysis
then
terminates
and
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
that
contract
if
the
contract
is
an
event
contract
the
analysis
proceeds
to
step
two
step
three
of
the
special
rule
step
three
is
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
certain
activities
that
were
listed
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
these
activities
are
1
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
2
terrorism
3
assassination
4
war
5
gaming
in
addition
to
these
five
specific
activities
congress
included
a
sixth
activity
of
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
this
sixth
activity
gives
the
commission
discretion
to
identify
other
similar
activities
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
event
contract
event
does
not
involve
any
of
the
six
activities
that
were
listed
in
the
special
rule
the
event
contract
is
not
eligible
for
the
special
rule
the
analysis
terminates
and
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
prohibit
the
contract
if
the
event
contract
event
does
involve
at
least
one
of
these
activities
the
analysis
continues
to
step
three
step
four
of
the
special
rule
step
four
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
the
contract
itself
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
phrase
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
used
three
times
in
the
special
rule
it
is
used
in
clause
i
in
reference
to
the
sixth
activity
in
the
list
of
activities
congress
included
in
step
two
of
the
special
rule
in
this
context
it
is
the
activity
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
not
the
contract
itself
it
is
also
used
in
clause
i
in
step
three
and
in
the
prohibition
in
clause
ii
in
reference
to
the
contract
itself
if
the
commission
does
not
determine
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
contract
is
not
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
special
rule
applies
and
the
contract
is
prohibited
7
no
agreement
contract
or
transaction
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
clause
i
may
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
the
three
steps
that
the
commission
follows
in
applying
the
special
rule
are
therefore
step
1
is
there
a
listing
of
an
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
if
no
stop
if
yes
continue
to
step
2
step
2
is
the
contract
an
event
contract
if
no
stop
if
yes
continue
to
step
3
step
3
does
the
event
contract
event
involve
an
activity
that
was
included
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
if
no
stop
if
yes
continue
to
step
4
step
4
is
the
event
contract
itself
considered
as
a
whole
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
no
the
contract
is
not
prohibited
if
yes
the
contract
is
prohibited
step
two
and
step
three
limit
the
scope
of
contracts
to
which
the
special
rule
applies
step
two
limits
the
special
rule
only
to
event
contracts
step
three
limits
this
scope
further
step
three
provides
that
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
all
event
contracts
but
only
to
those
contracts
whose
events
involve
one
of
the
activities
congress
listed
in
the
statute
step
four
provides
that
even
a
contract
that
passes
steps
two
and
three
is
not
prohibited
unless
the
commission
determines
that
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
following
graphic
illustrates
how
each
step
of
the
special
rule
functions
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
contracts
that
are
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
to
further
explain
the
role
of
step
four
congress
did
not
prohibit
an
event
contract
whose
event
involves
an
activity
listed
in
the
special
rule
an
event
contract
whose
event
involves
an
activity
listed
in
the
special
rule
is
only
prohibited
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
is
possible
that
an
event
contract
event
involves
an
activity
listed
in
the
special
rule
but
the
commission
does
not
determine
that
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
contract
would
not
be
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
for
example
an
event
contract
on
the
invasion
of
ukraine
would
satisfy

the

case
the

would

accordingly
the
commission
may
determine
that
the
event
contract
has
hedging
utility
other
economic
utility
or
benefits
and
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
point
that
a
contract
can
involve
an
activity
listed
in
the
statute
and
still
be
allowed
because
the
contract
itself
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest

commissioner

statement
is
available
here
once
an
event
contract
passes
step
two
the
analysis
moves
to
step
three
of
the
special
rule
step
three
is
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
involves
an
activity
that
was
listed
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
for
the
purposes
of
step
two
of
the
special
rule
an
event
contract
only
involves
an
activity
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
that
activity
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
in
step
four
is
different
from
step
three
the
analysis
in
step
four
considers
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
and
is
not
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
conversely
the
analysis
in
step
three
is
limited
to
what
activities
the
event
contract
event
involves
for
example
an
event
contract
can
only
involve
war
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
war
conversely
if
the
event
contract
event
does
not
involve
war
then
the
event
contract
does
not
involve
war
similarly
an
event
contract
will
involve
gaming
only
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
gaming
for
the
purposes
of
step
three
it
is
irrelevant
if
something
else
surrounding
the
event
contract
such
as
the
market
activity
of
trading
the
contract
involves
a
listed
activity
the
only
relevant
factor
for
step
three
is
whether
the
event
contract
event
involves
the
listed
activity
not
whether
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
involves
the
listed
activity
step
three
of
the
statute
applies
only
if
the
contract
event
is
an
enumerated
activity
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
analysis
of
whether
an
event
contract
involves
a
listed
activity
in
step
three
is
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
and
does
not
include
the
consideration
of
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
many
of
these
reasons
are
stated
in
the
letters
in
part
ii
of
this
comment
as
well
as
by
other
commenters
see
the
comments
of
josh
sterling

mcdermott
daniel
gorfine
lewis
cohen
jeremy
weinstein
and
railbird
technologies
the
exchange
provides
two
reasons
here
for
convenience
this
comment
refers
to
the
reading
that
the
analysis
under
step
three
includes
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
and
is
not
limited
to
only
the
event
contract
event
as
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
is
wrong
an
event
contract
can
not
be
considered
to
involve
a
listed
activity
based
on
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
and
not
only
the
event
contract
event
if
step
two
were
so
broad
it
would
1
not
provide
congress
intended
narrowing
function
and
2
it
would
render
the
statute
internally
inconsistent
the
sixth
activity
illustrates
the
flaw
in
applying
step
three
broadly
congress
included
as
the
sixth
activity
a
similar
activity
to
the
first
five
activities
that
is
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
the
sixth
activity
means
that
the
commission
can
determine
that
any
factor
that
is
part
of
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
this
is
because
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
step
three
is
not
limited
only
to
looking
at
the
event
contract
event
the
analysis
in
step
three
looks
at
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
accordingly
the
activities
included
in
the
list
in
step
three
are
not
confined
to
the
event
contracts
events
and
can
include
anything
relevant
to
the
event
contract
for
example
the
commission
can
determine
that
trading
contracts
on
a
certain
event
is
a
similar
activity
to
the
listed
activities
and
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
contracts
would
satisfy
step
three
even
though
the
event
contracts
are
based
on
events
that
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
the
trading
on
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
per
the
commission
determination
and
trading
on
the
contract
is
part
of
the
contract
when
considered
as
a
whole
the
analysis
would
then
move
to
step
four
but
step
four
calls
for
a
public
interest
analysis
of
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
where
it
has
already
been
determined
under
step
three
that
the
trading
itself
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
illustrates
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
what
congress
clearly
designed
is
a
statute
that
allows
the
commission
to
apply
special
scrutiny
to
contracts
based
on
particular
events
that
congress
identified
as
problematic
congress
did
not
shut
the
door
to
such
contracts
but
recognized
that
trading
on
an
even
contract
based
on
a
problematic
activity
that
involves
say
assassination
or
terrorism
might
nevertheless
have
redeeming
features
such
as
hedging
utility
that
would
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
event
contract
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
this
way
congress
clearly
differentiated
the
event
contract
event
which
may
be
disfavored
and
trading
in
the
event
contract
permitted
where
trading
on
the
disfavored
activity
offers
economic
and
other
societal
benefits
when
trading
in
the
event
contract
itself
is
included
in
the
analysis
at
step
three
the
distinction
congress
sought
to
draw
between
the
underlying
event
and
trading
in
the
contract
is
obliterated
this
defect
in
the
statute
that
emerges
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
from
the
sixth
activity
the
fact
that
the
defect
stems
from
the
sixth
activity
does
not
mean
that
defect
is
limited
to
the
sixth
activity
and
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
is
fine
with
regard
to
activities
one
through
five
that
would
misapprehend
the
way
that
statutes
work
once
it
is
demonstrated
that
step
two
can
not
be
about
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
for
even
one
activity
that
view
is
proven
wrong
therefore
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
is
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
regardless
of
the
activity
additionally
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
actually
renders
all
of
the
first
five
activities
in
step
two
superfluous
once
a
contract
passes
step
three
no
matter
which
activity
the
contract
involves
it
must
pass
step
three
to
be
prohibited
by
the
special
rule
the
analysis
in
step
four
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
any
event
contract
that
the
commission
determines
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
step
three
necessarily
would
also
satisfy
the
sixth
activity
in
step
three
for
example
an
event
contract
that
involves
war
will
pass
step
three
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
will
then
move
to
step
four
and
assume
that
the
commission
finds
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
that
point
the
event
contract
actually
involves
two
of
the
listed
activities
i
it
involves
the
activity
of
war
and
ii
it
also
involves
an
activity
that
the
commission
has
determined
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
is
impossible
for
an
event
contract
to
pass
step
four
and
not
involve
the
sixth
activity
in
step
three
accordingly
there
is
no
point
in
the
first
five
activities
listed
in
step
three
only
the
sixth
activity
in
fact
there
would
be
no
point
in
step
three
at
all
as
noted
the
sixth
activity
in
step
three
and
step
four
are
identical
accordingly
if
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
is
correct
congress
would
have
just
skipped
step
three
altogether
the
special
rule
would
have
been
a
simple
six
line
statute
that
said
only
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
levels
of
a
commodity
described
in
section
of
this
title
by
a
designated
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
inevitable
collapse
of
all
of
the
step
three
activities
into
the
sixth
activity
and
the
collapse
of
the
sixth
activity
into
step
four
under
this
expansive
interpretation
of
step
three
shows
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
is
wrong
the
correct
view
of
step
three
is
that
it
like
step
two
simply
describes
what
the
contract
is
based
on
and
the
analysis
in
step
three
is
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
accordingly
there
is
a
big
difference
between
step
three
including
the
sixth
activity
and
step
four
step
three
is
focused
only
on
the
event
contract
event
if
an
event
contract
passes
step
three
because
the
event
contract
event
involves
any
of
the
listed
activities
even
the
sixth
activity
the
analysis
under
step
three
will
always
be
different
from
the
analysis
under
step
four
the
analysis
under
step
three
will
be
whether
the
event
contract
event
involves
the
activity
the
analysis
under
step
four
is
very
different
step
four
does
not
only
consider
the
event
contract
event
alone
it
considers
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
thus
all
of
the
anomalies
that
directly
stem
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
three
disappear
under
the
view
that
the
analysis
in
step
three
like
step
two
considers
only
the
event
contract
event
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
the
analysis
in
step
three
like
step
two
is
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
steps
two
and
three
work
in
concert
to
create
the
eligibility
requirements
for
the
type
of
contract
that
the
special
rule
applies
to
an
event
contract
whose
event
involves
a
listed
activity
and
step
four
serves
as
an
independent
step
whose
analysis
considers
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
together
all
three
steps
form
a
coherent
and
cohesive
statutory
rule
that
implements
congress
intent
to
have
the
commission
review
a
narrow
subset
of
event
contracts
whose
underlying
events
involve
activities
such
as
terrorism
and
assasination
congress
did
not
want
to
automatically
legitimize
via
futures
and
swaps
trading
on
them
congress
nevertheless
gave
the
commission
discretion
to
allow
such
contracts
to
be
listed
if
trading
them
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
further
discussion
regarding
section
and
by
extension
rule
apply
only
to
event
contracts
where
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
plain
text
of
section
demonstrates
that
congress
limited
the
statute
scope
to
instances
where
the
underlying
activity
of
an
event
contract
is
one
of
the
enumerated
events
if
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
does
not
involve
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
listing
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
and
rule
regardless
of
how
the
act
of
participating
in
the
event
contract
itself
is
classified
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
extends
the
applicable
scope
to
also
include
contracts
where
the
underlying
activity
is
not
one
of
the
enumerated
events
is
overbroad
and
incorrect
first
section
limits
the
scope
of
the
commission
authority
to
activities
and
activities
only
the
commission
only
has
discretion
to
take
action
on
1
an
activity
this
is
unlawful

law
2
one
of
four
specifically
listed
activities
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
or
3
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
itself
has
previously
acknowledged
that
section
textual
focus
is
on
activities
the
underlying
conduct
in
describing
section

stated
that
the

of

authorizes
the
commission
to
prohibit
the
listing
of

contracts
based
on
certain
excluded
commodities
if
such
contracts
involve
one
or
more
activities
enumerated
in
the

emphasis
added
proposed
rule
see
i
at
if
the
commission
determines
that
such
product
may
involve
an
activity
that
is
enumerated
in
emphasis
added
these
activities
are
not
the
contracts
themselves
they
are
the
events
that
create
the
basis
for
the
relevant
contract
to
give
but
one
straightforward
example
in
the
statute
events
two
through
four
are
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
inclusion
of
these
activities
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
includes
contracts
when
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
act
of
participating
in
a
contract
is
not
itself
an
act
of
terrorism
assassination
or
war
to
illustrate
this
point
consider
hypothetical
contracts
on
whether
a
foreign
leader
will
be
assassinated
how
many
russian
planes
will
be
shot
down
by
ukrainian
forces
or
how
many
murders
will
occur
in
a
given
city
over
a
certain
time
period
section
and
rule
would
apply
to
these
hypothetical
contracts
because
the
activities
underlying
the
contracts
in
these
hypothetical
examples
are
the
enumerated
activities
of
assassination
war
and
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
the
purchasing
of
the
contract
itself
however
is
not
an
activity
of
assassination
war
or
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
second
section
and
rule
allow
the
commission
to
prohibit
the
listing
of
an
event
contract
only
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
that
are
against
the
public
interest
event
contracts
that
do
not
involve
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
may
be
listed
for
trading
because
the
special
rule
would
not
prohibit
the
listing
of
those
contracts
by
a
dcm
the
plain
language
and
structure
of
section
make
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
commission
discretionary
review
is
narrowly
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
contract
underlying
event
not
of
trading
in
the
contract
itself
section
begins
with
the
clause
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
emphasis
added
thus
at
the
outset
of
the
controlling
provision
the
statute
establishes
that
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
contract
is
the
nature
of
the
occurrence
or
contingency
the
final
clause
of
section
immediately
prior
to
the
provision
enumeration
of
the
covered
activities
refers
back
to
the
first
clause
of
the
provision
when
it
says
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
the
enumerated
activities
emphasis
added
when
the
clauses
are
read
together
section
grants
the
commission
only
limited
authority
to
review
a
contract
that
is
based
upon
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
that
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
plain
language
of
the
enumerated
events
themselves
bolsters
this
interpretation
as
kalshi
has
pointed
out
in
previous
submissions
section
first
and
sixth
categories
are
defined
respectively
as
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
and
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
emphasis
added
the
inclusion
of
the
noun
activity
and
the
reference
in
the
sixth
category
to
all
five
preceding
similar
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
the
underlying
activity
not
the
contract
itself
to
be
the
subject
of
review
and
scrutiny
and
it
must
be
assumed
that
decision
was
intentional
the
scant
legislative
history
a
colloquy
between
senators
diane
feinstein
and
blanche
lincoln
during
the
senate
consideration
of
dodd
frank
regulation
of
event
contracts
does
not
change
the
analysis
the
colloquy
did
not
address
whether
the
underlying
event
rather
than
trading
in
the
contract
itself
is
the
proper
subject
of
analysis
instead
the
senators
discussed
the
distinction
in
economic
purpose
between
contracts
that
serve
hedging
utility
and
contracts
that
are
designed
predominantly
for
speculation

statements
of
diane
feinstein
and
blanche
lincoln
available
at
in
any
event
the
language
and
structure
of
the
statute
are
clear
so
resort
to
legislative
history
is
unnecessary
the
sixth
enumerated
activity
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
further
highlights
that
congress
intention
was
for
the
commission
to
analyze
the
activity
underlying
the
contract
rather
than
trading
in
the
contract
itself
this
final
enumerated
activity
provides
the
commission
a
sort
of
catchall
to
determine
whether
the
event
involves
similar
activity
to
the
preceding
categories
and
thus
might
be
inappropriate
for
listing
since
terrorism
assassination
war
and
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
unquestionably
refer
to
the
occurrence
or
contingency
underlying
the
contract
the
sixth
catch
all
category
must
be
read
consistently
with
the
rest
of
the
enumerated
list
apples
must
be
compared
to
apples
we
explain
below
why
notwithstanding
the
commission
nadex
order
the
gaming
provision
must
also
refer
to
the
underlying
activity
and
not
trading
in
the
contract
itself
another
reason
that
section
must
be
read
as
focusing
on
the
underlying
activity
is
that
such
focus
is
congruent
with
the
nature
of
event
contracts
themselves
if
congress
was
concerned
about
trading
in
the
contract
itself
there
is
no
indication
why
it
would
have
limited
the
provision
to
event
contracts
rather
than
establishing
a
general
rule
that
would
have
authorized
the
commission
to
prohibit
any
derivatives
contract
that
the
trading
in
is
for
example
unlawful
under
state
law
other
principles
of
statutory
construction
also
undercut
the
application
of
the
proposal
erroneous
construing
of
the
statute
under
the
commission
interpretation
a
person
trading
an
election
contract
for
example
is
engaged
in
gaming
staking
something
of
value
upon
a
contest
of
others
by
parallel
reasoning
a
person
trading
a
terrorism
contract
is
engaged
in
terrorism
and
a
person
trading
a
war
contract
is
engaged
in
war
that
is
not
a
tenable
interpretation
of
the
statute
if
congress
intended
the
commission
to
focus
on
the
underlying
event
for
some
of
the
enumerated
categories
but
to
focus
on
trading
in
the
contract
itself
for
others
it
would
have
said
so
it
certainly
can
not
be
presumed
or
inferred
from
silence
that
congress
intended
the
commission
to
apply
disparate
analytical
approaches
to
the
single
list
of
enumerated
activities
when
the
correct
interpretation
of
section
is
applied
to
the
contracts
the
result
is
clear
elections
are
not
illegal
under
state
or
federal
law
are
not
gaming
and
are
not
similar
to
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
federal
or
state
crimes
terrorism
assassination
war
and
gaming
of
which
are
activities
that
congress
did
not
want
to
legitimize
or
encourage
via
event
contracts
without
careful
consideration
by
the
commission
the
commission
should
therefore
not
impede
kalshi
from
self
certifying
the
contracts
and
lacks
a
legal
basis
to
invoke
section
to
do
so
additionally
the
proposal
not
only
contravenes
the
language
and
structure
of
section
but
also
threatens
to
upend
the
cea
itself
virtually
every
futures
or
swaps
contract
can
be
described
as
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
some
future
event
this
overly
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
gaming
would
threaten
to
render
other
enumerated
provisions
superfluous
given
that
as
explained
above
virtually
all
event
contracts
could
potentially
qualify
for
that
categorization
as
the
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
observed
there
is
a
canon
against
interpreting
any
statutory
provision
in
a
manner
that
would
render
another
provision
superfluous

yet
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
derivatives
markets
means
that
the

preempts

holding
that
when
application
of
state
law
would
directly
affect
trading
on
or
the
operation
of
a
futures
market
it
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and

of

purposes
and

of

and
hence
is
preempted
quoting

therefore
regulated
futures
and
swaps
contracts
can
not
be
illegal
gambling
under
state
law
and
the
enumerated
activity
is
not
an
activity
that
would
otherwise
be
illegal
in
fact
and
as
discussed
in
greater
detail
below
many
states
ban
gambling
not
just
on
elections
but
more
generally
on
the
outcomes
of
future
events
these
laws
would
prohibit
the
entire
category
of
event
contracts
at
a
minimum
which
both
congress
and
the
cftc
have
expressly
permitted
to
be

some
of
these

control
or

nh
rev

also
bans

and
defines
it
similarly
as

a

risks
something

upon
the

of
a

that

all
of
these
various
provisions
illustrate
the
flaw
in
evaluating
whether
trading
a
futures
or
swaps
contract
constitutes
gaming
or
gambling
activity
or
whether
trading
a
futures
or
swaps
contract
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
instead
to
maintain
the
structural
integrity
of
section
and
the
cea
itself
the
commission
must
evaluate
whether
a
contract
involves
an
underlying
activity
that
is
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
of
activities
in
section
it
is
important
here
to
note
that
the
above
facts
are
clear
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
even
without
chevron
demise
the
proposal
resort
to
legislative
history
would
be
incorrect
the
current
regulation
demonstrates
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
is
contrary
to
the
proposal
by
using
the
words
relates
to
or
references
in
addition
to
involves
the
current
regulation
only
reinforces
that
the
relevant
activity
is
the
underlying
event
not
trading
on
the
underlying
event
it
would
not
make
sense
for
a
futures
contract
or
swap
to
reference
trading
in
the
contract
to
the
contrary
the
word
reference
is
a
clear
direction
to
focus
on
the
underlying
event
that
the
contract
references
thus
under
the
current
regulation
like
the
statute
the
relevant
activity
for
purposes
of
the
commission
event
contract
analysis
is
the
activity
on
which
the
contract
is
based
or
to
which
the
contract
refers
rather
than
the
contract
itself
because
the
contracts
are
not
based
on
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
does
not
need
to
consider
undertaking
a
public
interest
analysis
if
the
commission
were
to
conclude
otherwise
however
the
commission
could
either
permit
the
contracts
to
be
listed
the
statute
authorizes
prohibition
only
upon
a
commission
determination
that
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
determination
that
the
commission
may
undertake
or
conduct
a
public
interest
analysis
cftc
regulation
should
not
be
read
to
constitute
a
blanket
prohibition
as
that
reading
could
not
be
squared
with
the
statute

legislative

the

the

is
by
far
the
more
probative
evidence
of

meaning
the

extensive
reliance
on
this
sparse
legislative

is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
interpretive
approach
laid
out
in
kisor
and
provides
an
additional
reason
why
kalshi
can
self
certify
the
contracts
notwithstanding
the
proposal
provides
no
guidance
as
to
whether
congress
intended
the

to
limit
the
scope
of
section
to
instances
where
the
underlying
activity
of
an
event
contract
is
one
of
the
enumerated
events
this
reading
of
section
is
consistent
with
the
terms
used
by
the
commission
in
existing
rule
but
not
the
proposed
amendments
rule
borrows
heavily
from
the
terms
used
in
the
statute
including
multiple
uses
of
activity
in
both
subsections
the
regulation
also
uses
the
same
term
involves
which
appears
in
the
statute
but
also
adds
the
phrase
relates
to
or
references
when
describing
enumerated
activities
because
involves
is
the
only
statutory
authority
provided
by
congress
the
commission
can
not
expand
upon
the
scope
of
that
term
thus
the
only
way
to
read
relates

references
consistent
with
the

authority
is
that
they
are
the
specific
meanings

that

can
not
exceed
the
scope
of

any
interpretation

that
views
it
as
expanding
the

would
run
afoul

nonsensical
to

as
describing
the
act
of
participating
in
the

itself
to
be
clear
congress
could
certainly
promulgate
a
law
that
covers
the
participation
in
an

is
not
that
law

the
traditional

draw
the
defining
line
at
the
nature
of
the
activity
gambling
is
entertainment
whereas
economic
trading
is

itself
considers
gambling
businesses
to
be

the
broader
arts

sector
while
there
are
various
formulations
of
the
difference
between
gambling
and

trading
there
are
two
common
denominators
among
them
all
first
none
of
them
define
gaming
based
on
the
subject
of
the
transaction
second
they
were
all
ignored
by
the
cftc
the
cftc
proposal
divides
all
trading
into
two
buckets
trading
that
is
gambling
and
trading
that
is
not
gambling
and
the
difference
between
these
two
is
simply
the
subject
of
the
trades
it
is
easy
to
see
the
attractiveness
to
a
regulator
of
this
approach
it
provides
a
relatively
bright
line
for
the
regulator
which
is
relatively
easy
to
administer
however
there
is
an
implication
of
this
argument
that
is
important
it
means
that
the
sole
dividing
line
between
gambling
and
derivatives
trading
that
is
not
gambling
is
the
subject
of
the
trade
the
cftc
has
no
other
way
to
distinguish
between
gambling
and
derivatives
trading
consider
this
if
the
cftc
did
have
a
way
to
distinguish
between
gambling
and
derivatives
trading
then
the
proposal
to
consider
all
trading
on
certain
topics
gambling
would
make
very
little
practical
sense
it
would
mean
that
the
cftc
recognizes
the
there
could
be
non
gambling
trading
on
these
contracts
but
despite
that
the
cftc
will
consider
them
gambling
anyway
just
because
they
are
on
these
topics
that
not
only
makes
little
practical
sense
it
is
certainly
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
that
the
cftc
points
to
throughout
its
proposal
in
short
the
cftc
proposal
means
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
gambler
and
the
futures
trader
the
casino
and
the
exchange
other
than
the
types
of
bets
that
they
offer
according
to
the
cftc
proposal
the
casino
offers
bets
on
blackjack
and
the
exchange
bets
on
beef
the
cftc
proposal
has
familiar
strains
this
time
from
a
different
piece
of
legislative
history
one
that
took
place
many
years
ago
and
predates
the
cftc
in
its
current
iteration
this
one
a
robust
conversation
that
took
place
on
the
floor
of
congress
between
then
representative
burdick
of
north
dakota
and
other
representatives
and
recorded
in
the
congressional
record
chairman
on
the
first
day
of
this
session
i
introduced
in
the
house
a
resolution
for
the
appointment
of
a
select
committee
to
investigate
the
subject
of
futures
trading
it
is
known
as
house
resolution
25
and
it
has
been
referred
to
the
committee
on
rules
the
board
of
trade
lobbyists
that
infest
this
city
have
sought
in
every
possible
way
to
prevent
the
appointment
of
such
a
committee
and
the
holding
of
hearings
on
futures
trading
thus
far
the
committee
on
rules
has
taken
no
action
on
my
resolution
on
the
second
day
of
last
month
i
addressed
the
house
on
the
importance
of
an
investigation
such
as
is
called
for
in
house
resolution
25
i
made
mention
of
some
very
pertinent
i
not
only
charged
that
futures
contracts
are
gambling
contracts
and
are
generally
recognized
by
the
courts
as
such
but
i
also
charged
openly
on
the
floor
of
this
house
that
the
practice
of
futures
trading
fixes
a
low
ceiling
above
which
the
price
of
wheat
and
the
price
of
cotton
and
the
price
of
other
exportable
products
can
not
rise
try
as
we
may
to
enact
farm
legislation
in
behalf
of
agriculture
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
i
charged
openly
on
the
floor
of
this
house
that
our
farmers
in
the
united
states
are
today
as
much
subject
to
the
economic
domination
of
great
britain
as
they
were
in
colonial
days
before
the
revolutionary
war
i
charged
and
i
now
renew
the
charge
that
the
price
of
wheat
and
cotton
and
other
exportable
farm
products
is
dictated
from
england
and
that
due
to
the
operation
of
the
futures
market
ticker
tape
american
prices
are
lower
than
prices
paid
at
liverpool
which
is
a
buyer
world
market
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
i
made
other
charges
which
i
am
prepared
to
support
i
charged
openly
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
secretary
of
agriculture
wallace
condones
the
criminal
conduct
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
and
permits
his
underlings
to
print
publish
and
distribute
false
propaganda
in
support
of
such
conduct
i
mentioned
one
of
several
instances
of
that
sort
i
mentioned
the
propaganda
article
of
irwin
a
commodity
exchange
administration
pay
roller
which
was
published
in
the
june
1937
issue
of
the
illinois
law
review
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
i
charged
and
i
now
renew
the
charge
that
secretary
of
agriculture
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
have
condemned
the
favoritism
that
has
been
shown
by
the
business
conduct
committee
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
in
favor
of
certain
traders
and
against
certain
other
traders
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
chairman
i
have
barely
begun
to
mention
the
charges
that
i
shall
in
due
time
level
against
secretary
wallace
the
commodity
exchange
administration
and
the
chicago
board
of
trade
the
commodity
exchange
act
is
not
being
enforced
as
the
congress
intended
it
to
be
enforced
secretary
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
are
equally
guilty
along
with
the
commodity
gamblers
who
continue
under
the
protection
of
friendly
governmental
agents
to
rob
and
to
exploit
the
farmers
i
shall
be
more
specific
in
my
charges
the
commodity
exchange
act
by
its
express
terms
and
provisions
contemplates
that
the
futures
contract
markets
shall
be
markets
for
the
future
delivery
of
commodities
today
the
wheat
futures
market
for
example
is
more
of
a
gambler
market
and
less
of
a
market
for
future
delivery
than
it
was
yesterday
during
the
fiscal
year
ended
june
30
1937
the
volume
of
deliveries
under
wheat
futures
contracts
on
the
chicago
board
of
trade
was
only
fifteen
one
hundredths
of
1
percent
and
in
the
ensuing
fiscal
year
the
volume
of
deliveries
was
only
thirteen
one
hundredths
of
1
percent
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
i
charge
that
secretary
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
well
knowing
that
one
of
the
chief
reasons
for
the
enactment
by
the
congress
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
was
to
eliminate
excessive
speculation
in
futures
contract
markets
have
condoned
the
recent
action
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
in
reducing
margin
requirements
in
wheat
futures
trading
from
4
cents
a
bushel
to
2
cents
a
bushel
with
the
obvious
intention
of
stimulating
speculation
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
i
charge
that
short
selling
is
rampant
in
all
futures
tract
markets
that
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
secretary
wallace
and
of
the
commodity
exchange
administration
that
is
a
very
grave
charge
for
this
house
to
permit
to
pass
unchallenged
chairman
my
time
is
limited
today
i
shall
have
more
say
on
this
important
subject
in
the
near
future
however
before
i
take
my
seat
i
wish
to
go
on
record
with
another
very
serious
charge
against
secretary
wallace
and
the
commodity
exchange
administration
i
refer
to
the
willful
violation
by
the
chicago
board
of
trade
of
one
of
the
most
fundamental
conditions
imposed
by
the
commodity
exchange
act
on
futures
contract
markets
this
willful
violation
has
been
under
the
protection
of
friendly
governmental
agents
who
are
responsible
to
secretary
wallace
the
chicago
board
of
trade
boasts
that
it
is
the
largest
grain
market
in
the
world
that
is
far
from
the
truth
it
is
a
big
gambling
institution
dealing
extensively
in
lottery
tickets
on
price
fluctuations
but
it
handles
very
very
little
actual
grain
this
has
for
a
long
time
been
a
bone
of
bitter
contention
between
the
chicago
board
of
trade
on
the
one
hand
and
the
farmers
on
the
other
hand
yet
the
chicago
board
of
trade
will
not
furnish
any
figures
the
law
requires
as
a
condition
precedent
to
designation
by
the
secretary
as
a
contract
market
that
such
market
shall
first
make
provisions
for
i
wrote
duvel
chief
of
the
commodity
exchange
administration
on
february
13
asking
whether
the
secretary
of
agriculture
had
ever
complained
against
the
chicago
board
of
trade
for
failure
to
keep
records
and
to
make
reports
of
cash
transactions
i
did
not
ask
duvel
as
to
records
and
reports
of
futures
transactions
i
asked
him
specifically
as
to
the
violation
of
the
act
for
failure
to
keep
records
and
to
make
reports
of
cash
transactions
duvel
reply
dated
february
17
1939
is
evasive
and
unresponsive
i
here
and
now
charge
that
duvel
chief
of
the
commodity
exchange
administration
is
protecting
and
has
been
protecting
the
chicago
board
of
trade
in
a
very
serious
violation
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
in
this
particular
which
is
a
fundamental
condition
precedent
to
its
designation
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
as
a
contract
market
without
which
designation
it
would
not
be
entitled
under
the
law
to
do
business
at
all
and
i
charge
that
duvel
tried
by
his
letter
of
february
17
tosuppress
the
information
i
asked
for
these
are
very
grave
charges
against
secretary
wallace
and
chief
duvel
they
are
too
grave
for
this
house
to
permit
them
to
pass
unchallenged
chairman
i
charge
openly
on
the
floor
of
this
house
that
wallace
in
condoning
the
action
of
la
salle
street
contributes
to
robbing
and
exploiting
the
farmers
if
wallace
were
enforcing
the
law
instead
of
condoning
the
illegal
practices
of
the
chicago
board
of
trade
he
would
be
cleaning
up
the
situation
so
that
no
investigation
would
be
necessary
chairman
the
honor
of
this
demands
that
the
light
of
day
be
shed
on
the
operations
of
these
futures
traders
that
nullify
every
legislative
attempt
to
help
the
farmer
and
that
by
underground
means
to
defeat
the
enactment
of
any
measure
that
would
be
of
constructive
aid
to
agriculture
i
have
here
a
report
from
chicago
yesterday
which
states
quiet
but
persistent
selling
of
wheat
prompted
by
lower
quotations
abroad
caused
fresh
declines
of
as
much
as
one
half
cent
1n
value
here
today
poor
demands
from
importing
countries
with
shipments
of
exporters
and
wheat
stocks
afloat
larger
had
a
depressing
effect
on
prices
at
liverpool
and
thus
indirectly
exerted
pressure
on
the
chicago
market
if
you
do
not
believe
this
gambling
operation
has
any
effect
on
the
price
of
our
grain
listen
to
this
statement
from
chicago
john
macmillan
president
of
cargill
elevator
speaking
the
position
taken
by
the
board
of
trade
would
tend
to
depress
the
price
of
corn
received
by
the
farmers
and
would
benefit
the
short
sellers
in
the
chicago
corn
pit
the
only
way
shorts
can
fill
their
contracts
is
by
bringing
grain
to
the
chicago
market
but
when
they
have
sold
short
bushels
and
the
delivery
day
arrives
and
they
are
not
compelled
to
go
on
the
cash
market
and
buy
for
the
purpose
of
delivery
you
see
there
is
only
one
side
to
that
market
and
that
is
the
selling
side
and
that
is
the
side
which
is
supported
by
the
board
of
trade
in
chicago
and
supported
by
the
administration
of
this
act
which
is
under
the
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
merce
under
the
authority
of
this
board
their
agents
have
published
articles
advising
the
american
people
it
would
be
much
better
for
us
if
we
would
legalize
these
transactions
bolles
chairman
will
the
gentleman
yield
burdick
i
yield
to
the
gentleman
from
wisconsin
bolles
is
it
not
the
truth
that
this
is
one
of
the
great
reasons
for
the
depressed
price
of
grain
landis
i
noticed
an
article
stating
congressman
named
burdick
he
shot
off
his
mouth
over
on
the
hill
he
got
it
off
his
chest
and
if
he
wants
to
follow
these
hearings
he
can
follow
them
through
the
record
prepared
by
our
stenographers
here
is
it
a
fact
that
they
moved
these
hearings
from
washington
to
chicago
burdick
that
is
true
now
there
are
a
lot
of
members
of
congress
some
of
them
sitting
here
now
who
would
like
to
have
taken
in
that
hearing
to
understand
what
the
situation
is
and
then
prepare
to
meet
it
by
legislation
but
the
gentleman
from
indiana
landisl
is
correct
that
statement
was
made
by
this
attorney
for
the
chicago
board
of
trade
on
february
2
and
he
says
that
now
if
i
want
to
find
out
what
that
committee
is
doing
i
can
follow
the
records
as
they
shall
keep
them
by
their
stenographer
and
they
moved
the
hearings
out
of
the
city
of
washington
and
moved
them
to
the
sherman
hotel
in
chicago
and
that
is
where
the
hearings
are
taking
place
now
however
you
see
one
of
them
has
been
injured
one
of
these
gamblers
has
been
injured
himself
and
it
is
a
good
deal
like
revolutions
the
common
people
of
the
world
never
started
a
revolution
in
the
history
of
time
revolutions
are
only
generated
by
the
barons
when
they
injure
the
barons
they
will
have
a
revolution
but
the
common
people
never
had
one
now
we
are
injuring
the
barons
in
these
proceedings
and
one
of
these
barons
himself
states
that
this
practice
of
protecting
the
men
who
sell
without
protecting
the
buyer
has
the
effect
of
depressing
the
price
of
grain
now
what
difference
does
it
make
if
we
pass
the
cost
of
production
bill
all
the
difference
in
the
world
that
is
one
act
they
do
not
want
passed
by
this
congress
because
the
moment
you
do
that
you
put
them
out
of
commission
there
is
another
bill
they
do
not
want
passed
they
do
not
want
the
townsend
bill
passed
and
i
will
tell
you
why
they
do
not
as
i
pointed
out
to
this
house
a
week
ago
they
sell
so
many
bushels
of
paper
wheat
that
if
they
had
to
pay
2
cents
on
every
transaction
it
would
cost
them
5
to
carry
on
the
fictitious
sales
that
do
not
represent
the
sale
of
one
actual
bushel
they
will
fight
that
plan
and
they
will
fight
the
cost
of
production
plan
they
will
fight
anything
that
interferes
with
their
power
to
continue
gambling
transactions
in
these
boards
of
trade
i
have
not
anything
against
any
individual
in
chicago
or
elsewhere
the
only
interest
i
have
in
it
is
the
thousands
of
farmers
in
my
own
state
and
the
thousands
in
other
states
who
can
not
meet
their
interest
payments
who
not
make
a
living
who
are
living
off
of
this
government
when
we
have
these
millions
of
people
in
distress
in
america
it
seems
to
me
this
congress
should
be
willing
to
appoint
a
committee
to
find
out
whether
all
of
these
statements
i
am
making
are
true
or
false
information
will
never
hurt
anybody
but
the
fact
you
do
not
have
the
information
will
hurt
the
farmers
of
this
country
when
a
man
on
the
board
of
trade
can
sit
there
with
his
heels
on
a
mahogany
desk
and
make
more
money
out
of
a
bushel
of
wheat
by
gambling
in
it
than
a
farmer
in
north
dakota
or
elsewhere
in
this
country
can
make
by
digging
the
wheat
out
of
the
soil
it
seems
to
me
that
the
farmer
side
of
this
question
should
be
heard
in
this
congress
and
i
am
thinking
about
those
farmers
the
men
who
raise
corn
and
wheat
and
cotton
and
tobacco
i
know
how
poor
they
are
i
live
w1th
them
myself
and
i
know
they
are
so
poor
they
can
hardly
afford
to
raise
a
crop
there
is
no
one
who
can
raise
cotton
at
the
price
they
are
getting
today
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
these
men
who
own
the
land
have
a
sympathetic
feeling
for
the
men
who
till
it
there
would
be
much
more
suffering
in
the
south
than
there
is
today
many
many
thousands
of
the
men
who
produce
cotton
in
america
are
kept
from
abject
want
by
the
good
will
of
the
men
who
own
the
land
the
chairman
the
time
of
the
gentleman
from
north
dakota
has
expired
burdick
may
i
have
1
more
minute
gifford
on
the
bill
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
gentleman
thinks
of
the
bill
i
yield
the
gentleman
1
additional
minute
chairman
burdick
the
gentleman
insists
that
i
talk
on
the
gifford
no
i
do
not
insist
burdick
if
you
do
i
will
surely
give
it
to
you
gifford
no
i
do
not
burdick
the
only
thing
i
am
asking
of
this
congress
and
that
is
not
very
much
is
to
use
your
influence
if
you
have
any
do
not
think
i
to
have
a
committee
appointed
by
this
congress
to
investigate
this
gambling
institution
that
does
more
harm
and
causes
more
losses
to
the
american
farmer
every
year
than
anything
else
permitted
to
continue
in
this
country
applause
here
the
gavel
fell
this
stirring
and
historically
informative
repartee
is
but
one
salvo
of
a
broader
attack
leveled
against
the
derivatives
industry
over
the
past
100
or
so
years
of
course
the
accusations
focussed
on
the
issue
du
jour
but
they
are
all
variations
of
the
same
theme
that
derivatives
contracts
are
indistinguishable
from
gambling
the
proposal
decision
to
look
to
state
law
is
very
perplexing
for
many
reasons
none
the
least
that
the
same
state
laws
that
call
the
activities
enumerated
in
the
proposal
gambling
also
call
all
derivatives
contracts
gambling
this
certainly
seems
to
be
contrary
to
the
colloquy
which
was
explicit
in
the
two
senators
desire
to
keep
gambling
out
of
the
futures
markets
and
also
against
what
we
can
presume
is
congressional
intent
that
futures
contracts
are
not
all
gambling
of
course
many
futures
contracts
would
not
be
swept
up
in
the
proposal
prohibition
but
that
only
because
they
are
not
event
contracts
not
because
under
the
proposal
they
are
not
gambling
the
cftc
should
not
just
reject
the
proposal
it
should
repudiate
it
instead
the
cftc
should
recognize
the
point
that
we
begin
with
gambling
is
distinguished
from
derivatives
trading
by
more
than
just
the
subject
iii
the
proposal
references
to
the
first
enumerated
activity
and
its
reliance
on
its
incorrect
conclusion
in
its
kalshi
order
the
first
enumerated
activity
of
section
is
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
the
underlying
activity
of
election
contracts
which
is
what
the
proposal
is
referring
to
is
elections
there
is
no
state
or
federal
law
that
makes
elections
illegal
there
is
also
no
state
or
federal
law
that
prohibits
elections
or
voting
in
elections
accordingly
political
event
contracts
would
not
fall
under
the
special
rule
enumerated
act
of
illegal
activity
to
be
sure
27
states
do
prohibit
in
one
form
or
another
betting
on
elections
and
the
cftc
since
the
days
of
the
nadex
order
has
incorrectly
stated
that
state
gambling
definitions
of
wager
and
bet
are
analogous
to
the
act
of
taking
a
position
in
the
political
event
contracts
as
a
justification
for
prohibiting
those
contracts
listing
in
this
regard
however
the
nadex
order
the
kalshi
order
and
the
proposal
overextended
section
is
limited
to
the
activity
underlying
the
contract
not
the
participation
in
the
contract
itself
the
interplay
between
the
enumerated
activity
of
gaming
and
activities
that
are
illegal
under
state
or
federal
law
highlights
the
problems
with
the
commission
proposed
interpretation
of
both
activities
there
are
at
least
two
fundamental
differences
between
the
relevant
state
gaming
or
gambling
laws
and
event
contracts
as
commissioner
brian
quintenz
described
with
regards
to
the
withdrawn
erisx
sports
event
contract
trading
an
event
contract
with
a
binary
outcome
is
not
automatically
considered
a
gamble

the
many
other
distinctions
between
an
event
contract
and
a
gamble
include
the
fact
that
betting
is
a
game
of
pure
chance
without
any
economic
utility
while
event
contracts
are
non
chance
driven
outcomes
with
economic
utility
indeed
if
section
had
assumed
that
participating
in
any
event
contract
involved
making
a
wager
or
gamble
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contracts
upon
which
the
commission
could
make
a
public
interest
determination
the
fact
that
congress
separated
gaming
from
other
event
contracts
is
a
clear
indication
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
all
event
contracts
to
be
considered
gaming
in
fact
the
statutory
definition
of
bet
or
wager
used
by
the
proposal
itself
in
the
same
statute
clearly
indicates
that
not
all
cftc
regulated
products
are
gaming
31
a
part
of
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
that
definition
of
bet
or
wager
however
includes
two
relevant
exclusions
first
the
term
bet
or
wager
does
not
include
any
transaction
conducted
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
registered
entity
or
exempt
board
of
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
31
the
term
also
does
not
include
any
other
transaction
that
is
excluded
or
exempt
from
regulation
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
the
statute
cited
by
the
proposal
itself
demonstrates
that
the
proposal
expansive
application
of
section
is
incorrect
the
proposal
broad
interpretation
of
gaming
under
the
statute
and
rule
would
result
in
prohibiting
much
of
the
legally
registered
activity
that
the
cftc
has
previously
approved

gambling

on

moreover
the
purpose
of
the

cfma
and

was
to
create
clear
and
consistent
national
guidelines
a
contrary
interpretation
would
lead
to
the
undesirable
result
that
if
one
state
prohibited
a
specific
kind
of
contract
then
the
commission
could
use
the
special
rule
to
ban
that
contract
in
all
states
under
the
proposal
reasoning
because
rule
prohibits
the
listing
of
contracts
that
involve
gaming
laws
like
these
would
prohibit
all
event
contracts
for
example
event
contracts
on
the
weather
and
various
economic
indicators
would
be
considered
risking
something
of
value
upon
a
future
contingent
event
not
under
one
control
or
influence
and
yet
not
only
are
these
event
contracts
a
staple
of
cftc
regulated
dcms
but
the
commission
core
principles
require
that
event
contracts
be
specifically
outside
the
control
or
influence
of
a
market
participant
and
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
the
proposal
application
of
rule
would
therefore
preclude
the
cftc
from
regulating
any
event
contract
because
event
contracts
are
considered
gambling
under
some
state
laws
on
this
point
it
seems
that
at
the
very
least
rule
would
be
an
apa
violation
or
even
unconstitutional
if
the
analysis
in
proposal
was
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
congress
we
have
held
does
not
alter
the
fundamental
details
of
a
regulatory
scheme
in
vague
terms

because
such
an

would
lead
to
absurd
results
the
traditional
tools
of

and
the
process
required
by
the

that

the

stands

in

that

on

do
not

even
though
it
may

reasoning
in

consider

the

involves
the
stock

of
companies
in

that
produce
and
distribute
cannabis
for
consumption
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under

and
many
state

the

is
dependent
on

definition
of

namely
the

of
the

the
activities
of
these
companies
are
production
and
distribution
of
cannabis
for
consumption
which
are
all
activities
that
are
unlawful
under
federal
and
many
state
laws
and
should
otherwise
fall
under
the
purview
of
section
and
rule
certainly
if
the
statute
was
given
the
same
broad
reading
that
the
commission
gave
to
it
in
the
nadex
order
the
cannabis
equity
index
would
certainly
involve
an
enumerated
activity
and
be
subject
to
section
and
rule
yet
the
cannabis
index
contract
was
self
certified
and
the
commission
did
not
invoke
section
or
rule
therefore
it
is
clear
that
the
commission
has
not
maintained
the
nadex
order
overbroad
and
incorrect
reading
of
the
act
the
proposal
which
the
commission
notes
is
consistent
with
the
nadex
order
is
likewise
flawed
and
inconsistent
with
the
statute
iv
public
interest
determinations
should
be
contract
specific
the
proposal
to
determine
up
front
that
all
contracts
that
involve
enumerated
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
contrary
to
the
statute
as
noted
above
congress
enacted
a
rule
that
gave
the
cftc
authority
to
determine
that
specific
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
did
not
determine
that
all
contracts
involving
an
enumerated
activity
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
fact
it
clearly
determined
that
a
contract
involving
an
enumerated
activity
could
be
in
the
public
interest
which
directly
contradicts
the
proposal
additionally
the
statutory
language
is
clear
that
the
determination
must
be
contract
specific
and
not
a
blanket
determination
as
noted
in
the
discussion
of
step
one
above
the
special
rule
only
is
relevant
in
connection
with
a
listing
if
congress
intended
for
the
cftc
to
make
a
blanket
rule
the
introductory
clause
to
the
statute
would
have
no
meaning
additionally
the
sixth
enumerated
event
also
demonstrates
that
congress
did
not
authorize
the
cftc
to
make
a
blanket
prohibition
as
detailed
above
if
every
contract
that
involves
a
n
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
would
render
the
commission
further
determination
which
is
required
under
the
statute
meaningless
public
interest
the
cftc
proposal
takes
a
surprisingly
limited
view
of
the
power
of
its
markets
to
manage
risk
in
the
course
of
its
prior
two
requests
for
input
from
the
public
on
our
contracts
the
cftc
has
heard
from
hundreds
of
market
participants
from
individuals
to
massive
international
corporations
how
they
assess
their
exposure
from
elections
and
how
they
would
manage
that
exposure
and
the
cftc
rejects
all
of
this
which
brings
up
a
fair
question
does
the
cftc
think
that
these
people
are
lying
is
the
cftc
official
position
that
these
commenters
are
lying
it
hard
to
know
because
the
cftc
utterly
and
inexplicably
failed
to
address
the
prior
comments
it
requested
and
received
in
its
proposal
certainly
some
of
the
commenters
on
the
prior
rounds
and
doubtless
some
of
the
commenters
to
this
proposal
speculate
that
no
one
will
use
the
contract
but
it
obvious
that
good
governance
principles
demand
that
little
to
no
weight
be
given
to
a
comment
that
speculates
about
how
someone
else
will
use
a
contract
relative
to
the
comment
from
that
very
someone
else
comments
informing
the
cftc
about
how
the
contract
will
be
used
are
much
more
grounded
in
fact
and
much
less
speculative
than
someone
guessing
how
others
will
not
use
the
contract
this
point
is
obvious
when
the
two
camps
of
commenters
those
pro
event
contracts
and
those
anti
event
contracts
have
their
comments
stripped
of
the
linguistic
peripherals
that
commenters
use
to
obfuscate
their
main
points
those
in
the
pro
event
contracts
camp
say
this
we
identify
risks
and
we
will
event
contracts
to
hedge
that
risk
those
in
the
anti
event
contracts
camp
say
this
we
will
not
use
the
contracts
to
hedge
risk
and
we
guess
because
there
is
no
way
for
us
to
actually
know
this
that
those
other
guys
are
going
to
use
the
contract
to
hedge
risk
distilled
to
their
essence
it
seems
incredible
that
a
government
agency
that
prides
itself
on
being
data
driven
and
grounded
in
reality
would
give
any
weight
at
all
to
these
comments
from
the
anti
even
contracts
camp
they
are
not
only
speculative
they
are
directly
contradicted
by
the
information
that
the
cftc
has
asked
for
and
received
from
the
public
the
same
is
true
with
regards
to
the
use
of
the
data
from
the
contracts
the
cftc
was
again
told
by
a
broad
cross
section
of
the
marketplace
from
individuals
to
large
multinational
corporations
even
people
within
the
government
itself
how
the
data
is
used
and
just
as
with
risk
management
the
cftc
ignores
this
traditional
use
of
the
markets
one
that
would
certainly
satisfy
its
economic
purpose
test
and
should
also
weigh
much
stronger
than
the
other
considerations
than
the
ones
the
commission
focused
on
indeed
the
cftc
position
that
elections
do
have
direct
impacts
that
are
not
diffuse
is
very
hard
to
understand
there
are
huge
industries
that
have
direct
exposure
to
elections
of
all
type
the
stock
market
reacts
to
changes
in
the
polls
we
are
currently
in
a
hugely
important
election
cycle
is
it
at
all
credible
that
elections
do
have
huge
economic
impacts
if
so
why
do
they
dominate
not
just
the
regular
news
headlines
but
the
business
news
headlines
too
mainstream
media
is
filled
with
headlines
about
how
the
upcoming
presidential
election
will
impact
americans
the
wall
street
journal
the
new
york
times
the
washington
post
bloomberg
cbs
news
cnbc
news
yahoo
finance
fortune
and
the
street
are
just
a
handful
of
mainstream
outlets
that
have
recently
covered
how
a
potential
kamala
harris
or
donald
trump
presidency
might
impact
various
aspects
of
daily
life
including
investor
portfolios
the
stock
market
inflation
interest
rates
healthcare
retirement
savings
mortgage
rates
and
other
policy
areas
from
the
media
headlines
it
is
clear
that
the
upcoming
presidential
election
is
expected
to
have
significant
effects
on
the
economy
and
personal
finances
of
everyday
americans
and
people
are
talking
about
how
they
can
mitigate
the
potential
impacts
it
is
simply
wrong
to
assume
that
individuals
and
businesses
both
small
and
large
are
not
impacted
by
elections
elections
pose
broad
risks
many
of
which
can
not
be
easily
managed
by
other
contracts
and
certainly
not
without
event
contracts
the
premise
that
it
is
up
to
the
cftc
to
tell
the
market
how
to
assess
its
risks
and
then
how
to
manage
those
risks
and
how
to
ingest
information
and
what
to
do
with
that
information
is
simply
foreign
to
the
cftc
markets
and
its
traditional
role
and
is
wrong
businesses
reasonably
assess
risk
on
the
basis
of
what
events
can
occur
that
will
impact
the
likelihood
of
another
event
occurring
but
the
cftc
would
discount
those
risks
as
too
diffuse
to
be
managed
via
a
contract
that
also
is
simply
wrong
in
fact
the
cftc
regulations
make
numerous
mentions
of
risk
management
that
registrants
must
perform
and
there
is
no
question
would
expect
registrants
to
be
able
to
see
several
steps
down
the
road
and
how
one
event
can
impact
the
likelihood
or
risk
of
other
events
the
cftc
would
not
only
expect
registrants
to
identify
those
risks
they
would
expect
registrants
to
mitigate
those
risks
it
is
therefore
surprising
that
the
other
arm
of
the
cftc
seems
to
be
saying
that
firms
are
limited
to
identifying
and
managing
only
direct
risks
but
not
risks
that
involve
multiple
steps
and
are
too
diffuse
and
just
as
a
firm
can
reasonably
identify
an
election
as
a
risk
that
can
be
managed
a
firm
can
reasonably
identify
an
election
as
a
key
component
that
will
impact
its
future
planning
the
cftc
seems
to
just
ignore
that
businesses
and
individuals
make
probabilistic
decisions
and
elections
certainly
play
a
big
part
in
those
decisions
accordingly
probabilistic
information
on
elections
is
very
valuable
importantly
nothing
in
the
preamble
explains
why
the
cftc
ignores
the
comments
it
has
requested
and
received
and
ignores
the
importance
of
elections
to
all
market
participants
the
cftc
also
fails
to
address
why
it
believes
that
election
contracts
will
not
be
used
for
hedging
or
for
pricing
transactions
services
and
assets
on
more
than
an
infrequent
basis
additionally
the
cftc
ignores
actual
data
that
market
participants
and
industry
use
prediction
market
data
on
elections
mainstream
media
business
news
and
other
sites
use
prediction
markets
regularly
noting
their
odds
as
an
important
source
of
data
alongside
polls
for
one
example
out
of
many
from
august
8
2024
on
forbes
predictit
has
been
in
operation
for
a
decade
and
the
reams
of
evidence
of
the
importance
of
the
data
that
is
generated
by
markets
is
well
known
and
well
documented
the
discussion
above
focuses
on
election
contracts
because
we
are
currently
in
the
midst
of
an
historic
election
to
maintain
that
elections
do
not
pose
risks
that
can
be
hedged
and
election
markets
will
not
produce
useful
data
that
will
be
used
by
industry
is
more
than
arbitrary
and
capricious
but
these
truths
are
not
limited
only
to
elections
all
event
contracts
that
kalshi
has
listed
have
strong
hedging
cases
kalshi
incorporates
here
all
of
the
hedging
and
price
basing
analyses
that
it
shared
previously
with
the
cftc
kalshi
does
not
duplicate
the
arguments
here
because
the
arguments
are
confidential
but
these
are
all
information
that
the
cftc
has
in
its
possession
should
have
considered
when
creating
its
proposal
but
did
not
and
must
consider
and
address
prior
to
finalizing
any
regulation
the
events
that
the
cftc
has
specifically
identified
are
telling
on
the
entire
proposal
events
like
oscars
grammys
the
nobel
prize
etc
all
have
huge
economic
impacts
they
do
have
the
broad
impact
of
national
elections
but
they
have
big
impacts
on
the
communities
that
are
involved
much
the
same
way
that
pork
bellies
prices
impact
those
who
care
but
while
the
proposal
is
fine
with
pork
bellies
and
all
the
speculative
hedging
that
occurs
on
those
contracts
events
that
might
be
a
little
less
familiar
to
it
like
the
grammys
it
decides
just
do
not
have
enough
economic
impact
to
be
hedged
or
produce
useful
data
never
mind
the
massive
creator
economy
and
the
importance
that
these
events
play
to
them
their
economic
risks
the
intense
research
that
social
media
creators
do
are
apparently
according
to
the
proposal
non
existent
there
is
of
course
another
interpretation
of
the
proposal
and
again
the
proposal
failure
to
adequately
explain
what
it
is
doing
leaves
a
lacuna
of
information
that
requires
speculation
is
not
that
these
events
do
not
have
economic
impact
it
that
the
people
who
are
impacted
will
not
manage
their
risks
and
will
not
use
market
data
to
plan
their
businesses
how
the
cftc
would
know
this
is
not
clear
certainly
many
of
those
in
the
creator
economy
come
from
historically
underserved
communities
who
traditionally
have
been
gated
out
of
accessing
financial
markets
because
of
bias
and
discrimination
there
is
no
question
though
that
the
contracts
that
are
targeted
by
the
proposal
are
those
that
are
most
relevant
to
historically
underserved
communities
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
cftc
has
proposed
to
miss
this
opportunity
to
cater
to
the
needs
of
historically
underserved
communities
the
cftc
should
encourage
its
regulated
markets
that
are
serving
underserved
communities
it
should
partner
with
exchanges
to
educate
and
raise
awareness
of
the
benefits
of
regulated
markets
it
should
celebrate
the
toppling
of
financial
barriers
it
should
celebrate
its
regulated
markets
jettisoning
any
vestiges
of
elitism
and
embrace
that
its
regulated
markets
are
now
serving
the
needs
of
those
whose
needs
have
not
been
served
by
markets
instead
the
cftc
has
not
only
proposed
to
prohibit
this
expansion
the
proposal
simply
dismisses
the
validity
of
these
economic
interests
it
could
have
been
hoped
that
the
newfound
diversity
in
the
markets
would
be
celebrated
vi
the
inclusion
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
the
proposal
fails
to
articulate
a
rationale
for
including
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
in
the
definition
of
gaming
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
based
on
the
state
law
definitions
mentioned
above
does
not
include
this
additionally
the
cftc
does
not
provide
any
rationale
how
these
contracts
are
not
in
the
public
interest
lumping
the
outcome
of
the
super
bowl
with
the
number
of
viewers
of
the
super
bowl
is
incorrect
the
cftc
failure
to
articulate
any
rationale
for
this
proposal
and
the
public
interest
determination
violates
the
apa
vii
the
proposal
public
interest
determination
is
overbroad
the
proposal
will
ban
a
tremendous
variety
of
contracts
the
cftc
public
interest
determination
fails
to
provide
a
rationale
for
all
but
a
small
number
of
contracts
accordingly
the
proposal
violates
the
apa
the
cftc
is
required
to
provide
a
rationale
that
would
allow
the
public
to
know
why
each
contract
that
the
cftc
is
proposing
to
ban
is
banned
viii
the
proposal
regarding
existing
contracts
the
cftc
proposal
will
harm
market
participants
by
requiring
the
contracts
to
be
wound
down
to
be
clear
the
cftc
has
not
identified
any
harm
from
listing
the
contracts
not
a
single
harm
the
disproportionality
of
this
is
manifest
the
cftc
does
not
sufficiently
articulate
why
this
harm
to
market
participants
is
justified
nor
does
it
show
that
it
considered
alternatives
this
proposal
is
ill
conceived
and
should
be
reconsidered
the
failure
to
articulate
a
rationale
and
failure
to
consider
less
harmful
alternatives
violate
the
apa
ix
anticompetitive
considerations
the
cftc
analysis
is
facially
flawed
the
cftc
stated
that
they
found
that
this
proposal
will
have
no
anticompetitive
effects
that
is
so
patently
false
that
it
is
hard
to
understand
what
the
cftc
means
the
first
step
this
analysis
would
take
is
to
identify
where
these
contracts
are
available
the
answer
is
on
multiple
platforms
they
are
available
on
kalshi
and
on
other
platforms
that
are
not
regulated
by
the
cftc
the
proposal
will
ban
these
contracts
on
kalshi
the
proposal
will
not
ban
these
contracts
on
the
other
platforms
to
be
clear
market
participants
today
have
a
choice
of
where
to
trade
kalshi
and
other
platforms
the
cftc
proposal
will
prevent
kalshi
from
competing
with
these
other
exchanges
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
proposal
that
is
more
anticompetitive
than
this
the
cftc
proposal
on
this
is
again
beyond
arbitrary
and
capricious
sound
risk
management
the
cftc
proposal
states
that
the
commission
has
not
identified
any
effect
of
the
proposed
amendments
on
sound
risk
management
practices
as
detailed
above
event
contracts
perhaps
especially
the
ones
that
are
included
in
the
definition
of
gaming
provide
very
important
risk
management
tools
they
provide
hedging
tools
and
data
that
is
used
for
risk
management
in
addition
these
are
tools
that
are
not
otherwise
available
to
many
participants
the
cftc
concussion
is
incorrect
and
unsupported
xi
price
discovery
the
cftc
states
that
while
the
proposed
amendments
are
not
likely
to
have
an
impact
on
price
discovery
in
cftc
regulated
markets
the
commission
acknowledges
that
certain
event
contracts
could
have
limited
informational
value
in
other
contexts
outside
the
scope
of
cftc
regulated
markets
that
may
be
lost
if
the
proposed
amendments
are
adopted
as
detailed
above
this
conclusion
is
flatly
contradicted
by
reality
the
informational
value
is
extensive
and
broad
it
is
not
limited
at
all
xii
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
markets
being
that
kalshi
is
the
only
exchange
that
offers
any
contracts
that
would
be
affected
by
this
proposed
rule
the
cftc
discussion
of
these
factors
as
it
regards
existing
exchanges
is
limited
to
the
impact
that
it
will
have
on
kalshi
first
kalshi
notes
that
the
cftc
did
not
engage
with
it
prior
to
making
this
proposal
it
received
no
questions
regarding
the
impact
that
this
proposal
would
have
on
it
kalshi
is
therefore
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
the
cftc
based
this
section
of
the
proposal
on
this
fails
to
satisfy
