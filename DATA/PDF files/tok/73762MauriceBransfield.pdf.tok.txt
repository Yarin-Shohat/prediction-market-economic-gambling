said
in
a
webinar
tuesday
we
been
spending
time
on
derivatives
strategies
like
look
back
puts
the
comments
give
an
insight
into
how
some
of
the
world
richest
investors
are
thinking
about
the
november
vote
when
president
joe
biden
will
face
off
against
donald
trump
in
a
rematch
of
2020
about
half
the
global
adult
population
will
go
to
the
polls
at
some
point
in
2024
with
elections
held
in
the
past
few
days
in
india
south
africa
and
mexico
and
the
uk
calling
a
vote
for
july
polls
suggest
a
close
race
later
this
year
between
biden
81
and
trump
77
who
is
attracting
support
from
a
growing
number
of
financial
elites
despite
being
found
guilty
last
month
in
the
first
criminal
trial
of
a
former
us
president
as
president
trump
broke
with
decades
of
precedent
by
openly
attacking
fed
chair
jerome
powell
first
for
raising
interest
rates
and
then
for
not
cutting
them
further
trump
has
made
it
clear
that
he
would
reappoint
powell
to
another
term
if
elected
biden
by
comparison
has
taken
the
traditional
hands
off
approach
toward
the
fed
even
as
it
raised
interest
rates
at
the
fastest
pace
since
the
early
1980s
while
there
likely
to
be
a
bit
of
volatility
during
the
election
cycle
the
economy
remains
stable
and
growth
remains
stable
