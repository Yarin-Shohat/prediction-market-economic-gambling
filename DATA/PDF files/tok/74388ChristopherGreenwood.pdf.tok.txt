re
review
of
kalshiex
llc
proposed
congressional
control
contracts
pursuant
to
commodity
futures
trading
commission
regulation
i
a
founder
and
angel
investor
from
the
bay
area
svangel
my
investment
firm
has
had
the
privilege
of
working
with
several
hundred
companies
over
the
last
30
years
across
dozens
of
different
industries
these
partners
include
firms
like
google
facebook
coinbase
and
stripe
i
also
an
advocate
for
more
government
action
surrounding
gun
control
served
as
vice
chairman
of
ucsf
medical
foundation
and
have
sat
on
the
development
committees
of
institutions
like
ucla
packard
children
hospital
and
the
tiger
woods
foundation
which
aims
to
promote
children
health
and
education
i
appreciate
the
cftc
requesting
the
public
input
into
these
contracts
so
that
i
and
others
have
the
opportunity
to
weigh
in
on
their
value
the
cftc
products
underlie
the
global
financial
system
by
providing
risk
management
policies
for
many
different
sectors
consequently
i
pay
close
attention
to
the
space
kalshi
contracts
would
meet
a
demand
from
the
market
for
both
hedging
and
pricing
purposes
and
provide
an
invaluable
public
service
to
compete
with
polling
and
other
forecasts
i
strongly
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
contract
for
listing
by
october
28th
in
time
for
the
midterm
elections
hedging
and
price
basing
economic
utility
kalshi
contract
would
provide
meaningful
risk
mitigation
for
small
businesses
and
households
in
my
experience
as
an
investor
and
advisor
to
so
many
companies
and
small
growing
businesses
i
seen
first
hand
people
struggling
with
these
risks
the
product
proposed
by
kalshi
would
go
a
long
way
towards
managing
these
risks
more
specifically
the
cftc
has
solicited
public
comment
regarding
whether
the
outcomes
of
elections
are
predictable
in
order
to
serve
as
effective
hedging
tools
they
are
the
evidence
is
extensive
and
hard
to
ignore
this
is
not
a
secret
investment
banks
hire
whole
divisions
to
estimate
the
impact
elections
will
have
on
their
clients
this
data
is
also
published
publicly
on
occasion
or
discussed
by
the
financial
press
slate
wall
street
says
you
should
short
mexico
to
prepare
for
trump
while
some
headlines
refer
to
presidential
outcomes
plenty
detail
very
specific
congressional
outcomes
like
when
in
2020
bank
of
america
provided
roadmaps
for
each
type
of
partisan
outcome
one
party
controls
all
of
government
divided
government
et
cetera
there
they
wrote
that
full
democratic
control
of
government
would
lead
to
2
trillion
in
stimulus
compared
to
a
biden
win
with
a
divided
congress
1
trillion
or
a
trump
win
with
a
divided
congress
2
trillion
they
also
detailed
impacts
to
specific
sectors
like
businesses
exposed
to
chinese
trade
in
each
scenario
academics
consistently
discuss
the
link
between
changes
in
partisan
control
of
congress
and
changes
in
polling
with
consistent
effects
on
financial
markets
suggesting
significant
hedging
and
repricing
by
the
market
to
manage
risks
arising
from
upcoming
shifts
in
control
of
congress
ceos
also
frequently
flag
electoral
risk
as
it
relates
to
their
bottom
line
in
earnings
calls
according
to
factset
more
than
a
third
of
earnings
calls
in
q3
2020
mentioned
the
word
election
i
encourage
commissioners
and
staff
to
see
these
discussions
concerns
about
a
particular
congressional
outcome
are
particularly
relevant
for
energy
health
care
and
financial
firms
comments
by
several
businesses
and
individuals
have
also
testified
to
the
importance
of
hedging
elections
in
their
lives
and
businesses
if
the
market
is
engaging
in
significant
extant
hedging
activity
then
it
is
not
deniable
that
an
election
event
contract
contains
significant
hedging
utility
and
it
is
reasonably
likely
that
the
contract
will
be
used
for
hedging
the
hedging
use
of
this
contract
is
so
obvious
that
it
would
satisfy
even
the
cftc
proposed
test
of
market
demand
exists
i
also
note
that
concerns
along
the
lines
of
whether
elected
officials
actually
successfully
implement
their
goals
and
policies
are
incorrect
as
discussed
above
markets
and
businesses
react
to
risks
of
political
control
so
clearly
political
control
risks
have
impacts
and
these
risks
can
be
managed
further
this
is
not
different
from
many
other
existing
cftc
products
basis
risk
is
normal
in
many
derivative
products
like
hurricane
or
housing
price
index
futures
there
no
guarantee
that
a
drop
in
the
case
shiller
housing
price
index
whose
futures
are
listed
on
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
will
actually
reduce
asset
value
or
cash
flows
for
an
investor
or
homeowner
nonetheless
the
cftc
permitted
these
valuable
market
innovations
to
be
listed
i
also
note
that
a
commenter
saying
i
could
not
or
would
not
use
this
contract
to
hedge
should
have
little
consequence
there
is
certainly
no
requirement
that
everyone
be
able
to
use
the
contract
to
hedge
only
that
it
can
reasonably
be
used
for
hedging
all
of
the
comments
demonstrating
how
the
contract
can
be
used
for
hedging
directly
address
the
question
and
demonstrate
that
the
contract
can
and
will
be
used
for
hedging
question
seven
asks
whether
the
risks
that
elections
portend
can
be
hedged
using
other
products
i
am
not
aware
of
another
circumstance
where
this
logic
was
used
to
potentially
deny
a
product
with
legitimate
hedging
purposes
though
i
can
imagine
many
such
instances
such
as
hedging
the
risk
of
government
benefits
being
taken
away
the
contract
itself
would
still
be
valuable
to
isolate
risk
rather
than
be
subject
to
the
risks
of
other
assets
and
produce
significant
price
basing
benefits
uniquely
public
interest
in
addition
to
furthering
the
public
interest
by
introducing
an
important
hedging
tool
the
markets
will
further
the
public
interest
by
providing
an
important
data
point
that
will
help
researchers
and
policy
makers
predictit
has
been
cited
by
many
prominent
scholars
and
government
officials
its
markets
are
frequently
referred
to
by
the
political

and
leading
thinkers
to
get
a
non
partisan
view
of
the
likelihood
of
an
election
outcome

the
fact
that
predictit
has
such
power
in
the
political
press
despite
its
position
and
trader
limits
is
indicative
of
the
incredible

in

finally
the
cftc
asked
if
this
situation
is
any
different
than
in
2012
when
it
previously
ruled
on
similar
contracts
event
contracts
were
extremely
limited
in
practice
in
2012
in
2008
when
it
sought
public
comment
on
event
contract
regulation
the
commission
acknowledged
its
extremely
limited
experience
with
event
contracts
in
fact
it
admitted
its
only
experience
was
with
iowa
electronic
markets
for
which
it
had
given
two
no
action
letters
in
the
1990s
between
then
and
the
nadex
order
the
only
event
contracts
that
were
certified
with
the
commission
were
a
small
number
of
economic
indicators
from
nadex
itself
and
motion
picture
box
office
contracts
which
were
swiftly
banned
by
congress
that
being
said
the
concept
of
election
event
contracts
was
so
natural
to
the
commission
such
that
even
at
that
time
the
commission
used
the
example
of
a
presidential
election
binary
to
explain
event
contracts
to
the
public
federal
register
concept
release
on
the
appropriate
regulatory
treatment
of
event
contracts
event
contracts
were
so
limited
in
2012
that
regulation
which
was
the
justification
for
rejecting
nadex
contracts
was
only
published
the
day
before
the
nadex
order
kalshi
proposal
provides
a
prime
opportunity
for
the
commission
to
make
a
decision
more
in
line
with
the
public
interest
and
law
innovation
the
fact
that
these
contracts
are
innovative
is
not
a
reason
to
prohibit
the
contract
many
innovative
products
have
become
staples
of
the
markets
and
have
encouraged
significant
economic
growth
in
the
past
for
example
basic
agricultural
futures
and
index
settled
products
were
once
considered
to
be
devoid
of
hedging
utility
and
be
pure
gaming
products
today
those
products
are
cornerstones
of
the
global
financial
system
it
is
critical
for
government
agencies
to
rely
on
evidence
and
testimony
from
potential
hedgers
and
others
rather
than
speculation
or
knee
jerk
skepticism
to
novel
products
like
kalshi
this
means
considering
their
testimony
looking
at
the
experiences
of
other
nations
and
the
large
value
that
election
markets
have
had
for
academics
and
the
public
as
discussed
above
kalshi
contract
submission
does
already
have
significant
market
hedging
activity
however
i
concerned
that
it
could
stifle
innovation
to
require
this
of
proposals
especially
as
outlined
in
questions
eight
and
nine
question
eight
specifically
requests
whether
the
commission
should
consider
requiring
applicants
to
provide
demonstrated
need
of
hedging
and
then
asking
if
some
percent
of
market
participants
must
be
legitimately
hedging
both
of
these
standards
would
be
very
damaging
towards
responsible
innovators
a
demonstrated
need
standard
could
make
it
more
difficult
for
participants
to
bring
products
to
market
that
potentially
disrupt
and
compete
with
existing
products
or
which
serve
a
niche
that
has
yet
to
but
will
be
filled
in
addition
there
is
no
way
for
a
registrant
to
prove
in
advance
of
listing
nor
does
there
exist
a
mechanism
by
which
the
commission
could
reasonably
guess
what
percent
of
its
participants
would
be
hedging
as
opposed
to
speculating
it
seems
perverse
to
prevent
would
be
hedgers
from
using
a
product
that
would
benefit
them
on
the
basis
that
too
many
others
would
use
it
for
speculation
it
would
be
disappointing
to
see
these
novel
standards
applied
to
kalshi
contract
as
precedent
for
future
submissions
question
nine
then
goes
on
to
ask
whether
and
how
the
commission
should
consider
the
contract
availability
towards
retail
investors
should
affect
their
analysis
the
commission
should
not
punish
the
contract
for
being
more
accessible
not
less
to
investors
although
retail
investors
are
smaller
they
are
affected
just
as
much
by
macro
political
level
events
as
large
businesses
retail
investors
can
hedge
all
the
same
and
are
no
more
likely
to
engage
in
speculation
as
large
dollar
institutions
many
of
whom
specialize
in
such
behavior
kalshi
contract
is
a
potentially
powerful
tool
for
the
market
i
look
forward
to
the
commission
decision
