when
considering
the
public
policy
implications
of
the
proposed
contract
it
is
constructive
for
the
commission
to
recognize
the
robust
information
environment
in
which
the
contract
proposes
to
trade
in
particular
there
is
no
shortage
of
commentary
and
prediction
relating
to
the
outcome
of
federal
elections
in
general
or
the
prospects
for
control
of
either
house
of
congress
in
particular
the
proposed
contract
will
thus
not
be
introduced
in
an
information
vacuum
the
contract
implications
for
the
public
interest
are
therefore
most
accurately
appreciated
by
considering
the
marginal
effects
that
its
introduction
would
have
over
and
above
the
robust
information
sources
already
present
in
the
market
and
that
will
continue
to
be
vigorously
exercised

the

in

alternative

operate
with
varying
degrees
of
transparency

and
many
are
not
subject
to
direct

federal

for
example
neither
know
the
identities
or

of
persons
who
respond
to

nor
can
audit
or
validate
the
numerous
statistical
models
that
operate
in
this
space
indeed
first
amendment
considerations
properly
limit
the
government
ability
to
monitor

control
alternative
predictive
information
sources
in
contrast
kalshi
contract
will
have
a
level
of
transparency
and
regulatory
compliance
unequaled
by
any
of
these
other
predictive
sources
the
processes
by
which
kalshi
generates
its
predictive
information
will
also
be
fully
transparent
to
regulators
and
market
participants
alike
and
will
be
subject
to
careful
scrutiny
kalshi
will
thus
add
a
differentiated
and
regulated
voice
to
predictive
public
information
flows
second
numerous
observers
have
commented
on
the
possibility
that

are
becoming
less
reliable
either
because

are
unwilling
to
respond

to

or
because

kalshi
market
is
not
as
vulnerable
to
these
concerns
because
kalshi
market
participants
have
powerful
incentives
to
accurately
predict
election
outcomes
expressing
any
other
incentive
would
be
financially
costly
and
adverse
to
the
trader
financial
interests
from
that
perspective
knowledgeable
observers
interested
in
adjusting
for
biases
that
might
be
influencing
polling
practices
have
incentives
to
express
their
adjustment
factors
by
participating
in
the
kalshi
contract
and
thereby
informing
the
rest
of
the
market
of
these
adjustment
factors
third
by
operating
a
differentiated
market
in
which
knowledgeable
observers
can
express
predictive
judgments
in
an
incentive
compatible
manner
free
of
biases
that
can
influence
other
predictive
methodologies
kalshi
contract
will
add
to
the
competitiveness
accuracy
and
transparency
of
all
predictive
forms
of
expression
in
the
marketplace
fourth
concerns
that
a
contract
like
kalshi
might
be
used
for
manipulative
purposes
are
easily
exaggerated
persons
interested
in
manipulating
markets
have
little
incentive
to
identify
themselves
to
federal
authorities
who
can
quickly
respond
with
civil
or
criminal
sanctions
persons
interested
in
manipulating
federal
elections
will
find
it
far
more
rational
to
launch
social
media
disinformation
campaigns
or
other
forms
of
deception
than
to
participate
in
a
contract
market
where
they
must
identify
themselves
and
know
that
their
every
move
is
monitored
by
regulatory
authorities
further
because
of
the
ambiguous
relationship
between
turnout
and
perceived
position
in
a
campaign
it
is
far
from
clear
how
persons
interested
in
manipulating
an
election
would
participate
in
the
kalshi
market
would
a
person
favoring
candidate
x
want
to
inflate
the
probability
that
opponent
y
will
prevail
and
thereby
attempt
to
stimulate
more
x
supporters
to
show
up
at
the
polls
or
would
the
person
favoring
candidate
x
want
to
deflate
the
probability
that
opponent
y
will
prevail
in
order
to
dishearten
candidate
y
supporters
and
suppress
opponent
turnout
and
if
market
participants
seek
for
partisan
reasons
to
tilt
the
market
one
way
or
another
they
will
be
entirely
unable
to
prevent
counterparties
from
entering
the
market
to
offset
their
non
market
based
efforts
to
influence
kalshi
predictive
estimates
indeed
they
woud
be
creating
profitable
trading
strategies
for
their
opponents
hardly
an
outcome
they
would
welcome
the
optimal
strategy
for
a
potential
manipulator
is
thus
far
from
clear
and
this
ambiguity
very
substantially
diminishes
concern
that
the
kalshi
market
will
be
used
for
manipulative
purposes
indeed
given
the
ambiguous
electoral
consequences
of
efforts
to
influence
pricing
of
the
kalshi
contract
a
person
interested
in
promoting
one
candidate
over
another
would
likely
find
it
far
more
rational
simply
to
contribute
to
the
favored
candidate
campaign
where
the
effect
of
the
contribution
is
far
less
ambiguous
fifth
the
electorate
view
of
the
likely
outcome
of
an
election
will
not
be
determined
exclusively
by
the
pricing
of
the
kalshi
contract
voters
retain
access
to
multiple
sources
of
predictive
information
as
described
above
and
will
discount
kalshi
predictive
information
to
the
extent
appropriate
in
light
of
all
other
predictive
information
sources
that
are
active
in
the
market
sixth
the
extent
to
which
the
public
is
willing
to
rely
on
the
predictive
information
generated
by
the
kalshi
contract
will
be
codetermined
by
the
level
of
confidence
the
kalshi
contract
generates
in
its
integrity
the
greater
the
public
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
the
information
generated
by
the
contract
the
greater
the
reliance
the
public
will
place
on
the
contract
and
the
more
valuable
the
contract
to
society
and
to
its
sponsors
the
contract
sponsors
thus
have
intrinsic
incentives
to
operate
the
market
without
bias
or
favor
to
any
side
of
any
contract
and
to
assure
that
the
contract
predictive
results
are
as
unbiased
and
accurate
as
possible
it
is
unclear
that
every
other
voice
in
the
market
for
predictive
information
has
equivalently
neutral
incentives
i
trust
that
these
observations
are
helpful
to
the
commission
in
its
deliberations
and
would
be
happy
to
respond
to
any
inquiries
that
the
agency
might
wish
to
pose
as
part
of
its
deliberative
process
