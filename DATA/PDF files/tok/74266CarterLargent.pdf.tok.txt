technology
sector

risk
tech

face
varying
regulatory
landscapes
depending

particularly
regarding

funding
risks
educational

particularly
those
reliant
on

management
companies
involved
in
large

infrastructure
projects
face
risks
related
to
changes
in

policies
these
contracts
offer
a
way
to
mitigate
risks
associated
with
long

projects
that
span
multiple
election
cycles
these
examples
illustrate
the
diverse
and
significant
hedging
applications
of
election
event
contracts
across
various
sectors
of
the
economy
by
banning
these
contracts
the
cftc
would
be
eliminating
an
important
risk
management
tool
potentially
increasing
systemic
risk
and
leaving
businesses
and
individuals
more
exposed
to
political
uncertainties
furthermore
the
proposal
suggestion
that
these
contracts
lack
economic
purpose
ignores
the
clear
and
substantial
hedging
use
cases
outlined
above
the
cftc
should
recognize
that
political
risk
is
a
real
and
significant
factor
that
affects
economic
decision
making
and
financial
planning
for
a
wide
range
of
market
participants
in
conclusion
i
strongly
urge
the
commission
to
reject
the
proposed
ban
on
election
event
contracts
instead
the
cftc
should
work
towards
developing
a
regulatory
framework
that
preserves
these
valuable
hedging
tools
while
addressing
any
legitimate
concerns
about
market
integrity
or
manipulation
by
doing
so
the
commission
can
fulfill
its
mandate
to
foster
open
transparent
and
competitive
markets
that
serve
crucial
economic
functions
