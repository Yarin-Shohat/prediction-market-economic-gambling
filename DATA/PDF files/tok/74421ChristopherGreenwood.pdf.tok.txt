alex
bouaziz
the
ceo
founder
of
the
deel
the
world
leading
payroll
and
expense
management
software
company
we
are
writing
to
support
the
legalization
of
election
prediction
markets
in
the
united
states
as
business
owners
we
are
well
aware
of
the
impact
of
government
changes
on
the
bottom
line
of
american
businesses
changes
in
tax
law
for
instance
do
not
simply
affect
the
amount
one
has
to
pay
today
they
may
affect
the
viability
of
a
vast
number
of
investments
that
a
business
may
make
as
well
in
addition
changes
in
immigration
law
may
harm
the
ability
of
a
tech
startup
to
attract
the
best
talent
from
around
the
world
if
those
changes
limit
the
accessibility
of
or
other
visa
categories
game
changing
engineers
can
be
anywhere
in
the
world
and
any
constraint
on
a
startup
ability
to
find
and
hire
them
could
cause
a
major
financial
loss
as
a
result
greater
restrictions
on
immigration
would
harm
deel
and
many
other
companies
in
particular
since
deel
is
a
company
that
helps
firms
hire
the
best
candidates
from
all
around
the
world
we
are
particularly
impacted
by
changes
in
immigration
law
these
two
examples
are
far
from
exhaustive
but
constitute
two
representative
substantiations
of
the
broader
principle
that
the
economic
consequences
of
federal
policy
can
be
very
real
perhaps
the
biggest
channel
by
which
federal
policy
transmits
to
small
businesses
are
changes
in
the
overall
business
environment
federal
policy
regarding
automatic
stabilizers
fiscal
stimulus
the
federal
debt
and
public
infrastructure
can
affect
the
level
of
growth
in
the
economy
the
national
interest
rate
and
the
overall
level
of
price
growth
those
variables
in
turn
can
have
enormous
impacts
on
a
company
like
deel
which
provides
expense
management
and
payroll
services
to
many
fast
growing
startups
if
the
number
of
startups
shrinks
due
to
a
hostile
business
environment
then
that
would
harm
our
bottom
line
over
the
last
year
we
have
seen
numerous
policy
priorities
from
members
of
congress
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
that
make
those
differences
stark
to
even
a
casual
observer
these
represent
risks
to
our
balance
sheet
and
to
millions
of
others
a
product
that
would
help
us
reduce
our
exposure
to
political
changes
would
thus
help
manage
our
risk
and
allow
us
to
focus
on
delivering
the
best
product
we
can
to
our
customers
