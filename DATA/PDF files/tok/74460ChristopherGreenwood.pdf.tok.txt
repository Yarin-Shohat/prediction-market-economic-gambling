the
recurring
theme
in
the
case
law
in
the
united
states
considering
whether
activities
with
an
aleatory
element
constitute
wagering
is
that
when
the
underlying
activity
either
does
not
have
any
extrinsic
economic
purpose
such
as
pure
pastimes
like
casino
games
or
constitutes
some
type
of
diversion
that
may
have
relevance
to
the
participants
in
the
scheme
but
no
outside
economic
consequence
such
as
sporting
events
wagering
is
found
while
an
aleatory
element
can
also
be
identified
in
many
other
contractual
relationships
including
most
commodities
futures
and
options
contracts
where
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
contract
is
a
commercial
one
or
in
the
case
of
contracts
traded
on
markets
and
cleared
through
clearing
organizations
the
contract
can
reasonably
be
used
for
bona

and

wagering
is
generally
not
found

this
is

it
can
be
shown
that
the

are
being
used
at

in

for
legitimate

the

of
the

which

will
be
in

of
either
chamber

has

any

any

all

congressional

thus
poses
significant
risks
that
could
impact
almost
all
participants
in
the
space
in

often
make
economic
decisions

of
these
cases
the
risk
of

is
of
great
economic
importance
to
many
households
and
businesses
that
the
proposed
event
contract
could
provide
a

function
for
in
fact
the
hedging
utility
of
the

in
contrast
the
question
underlying
the
proposed
event
contract
relates
to
the
cumulative
results
of
hundreds
of
separate
elections
through
states
and
electoral
districts
of
the
united
states
the
combined
outcome
of
multiple
geographically
dispersed
elections
is
not
a
subject
covered
in
any
of
the
state
statutes
discussed
above
in
fact
although
states
may
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
eliminating
the
risk
of
manipulation
that
is
potentially
present
in
a
contract
relating
to
a
single
local
election
states
do
not
have
a
demonstrable
interest
in
a
contract
relating
to
the
aggregate
result
of
all
local
elections
whether
inside
or
outside
of
the
state
this
point
is
made
particularly
clear
by
the
south
carolina
code
which
specifically
prohibits
only
betting
on
election
results
in
the
state
of
south
carolina
the
collective
election
results
across
the
country
and
the
party
control
of
either
chamber
of
the
congress
should
not
be
of
interest
or
concern
to
any
given
state
despite
certain
state
statutes
on
their
face
linking
the
terms
gaming
or
gambling
together
with
betting
on
elections
the
aggregate
election
result
which
is
the
underlying
question
of
the
proposed
event
contract
should
not
be
interpreted
to
be
subject
to
these
state
statutes
notwithstanding
the
above
as
discussed
earlier
the
proposed
event
contract
serves
a
clear
commercial
or
economic
purpose
and
thus
should
not
be
considered
gaming
or
gambling
or
otherwise
an
illegal
activity
for
no
reason
other
than
the
fact
that
certain
state
statutes
link
gaming
or
gambling
to
betting
on
elections
on
its
face
furthermore
considering
the
second
part
discussed
in
the
nadex
order
drawing
an
analogy
to
wager
and
bet
the
act
of
taking
a
position
on
the
aggregate
election
results
across
all
states
is
not
similar
to
the
state
law
definitions
of
the
terms
wager
or
bet
given
the
lack
of
an
aleatory
element
the
precise
test
for
when
a
contract
involves
wagering
or
betting
vary
from
state
to
state
but
the
principles
discussed
herein
apply
generally
across
the
various
states
as
cited
in
the
nadex
order
for
example
under
wisconsin
law
a
bet
is
defined
to
mean
a
bargain
in
which
the
parties
agree
that
dependent
upon
chance
even
though
accompanied
by
some
skill
one
stands
to
win
or
lose
something
of
value
specified
in
the
agreement
but
excludes
any
bona
fide
business
transactions
which
are
valid
under
the
law
of
contracts
stat
ann
a
wisconsin
court
when
finding
that
a
pyramid
scheme
does
not
fall
within
the
exception
reasoned
that
the
pyramid
club
at

had
no
element
of
a
bona
fide
business
purpose
see

dahlk
330

1983
to
the
contrary
as
discussed
earlier
the
proposed
event
contract
serves
the
bona
fide
business
purpose
of
risk
hedging
in
the
same
way
as
insurance
contracts
do
though
one
can
argue
that
taking
a
position
on
the
aggregate
election
result
and
thus
outcome
of
the
proposed
event
contract
depends
upon
chance
to
a
limited
extent
this
fact
on
its
own
does
not
mean
that
taking
a
position
on
the
proposed
event
contract
is
analogous
to
betting
as
every
derivatives
contract
necessarily
involves
an
element
of
chance
this
position
was
clearly
articulated
by
an
illinois
court
when
it
decided
which
test
to
adopt
for
determining
whether
a
contest
is
one
of
skill
or
chance
under
state
law
see

having
considered
the
any
chance
test
which
would
find
a
contest
to
be
gambling
if
it
involved
any
chance
whatsoever
the
illinois
court
rejected
this
standard
finding
instead
that
the
any
chance
test
results
in
essentially
no
test
at
all
as
every
contest
involves
some
degree
of
chance
as
discussed
above
in
the
case
of
the
proposed
event
contract
chance
will
not
be
the
dominant
factor
in
determining
a
participant
economic
exposure
which
instead
will
be
driven
primarily
by
the
research
performed
in
addition
where
the
opportunity
for
bona
fide
risk
hedging
is
present
and
contracts
trade
on
an
organized
and
regulated
market
the
activity
should
not
be
considered
illegal
gambling
wagering
or
betting
under
state
law
though
states
have
an
interest
in
prohibiting
these
illegal
activities
which
are
different
from
economic
hedging
activities
the
proposed
event
contract
like
other
event
contracts
should
be
considered
legal
hedging
activities
any
concerns
that
states
might
have
with
respect
to
the
proposed
event
contract
are
further
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
the
proposed
event
contract
will
be
listed
and
traded
on
a
federally
regulated
platform
iii
the
proposed
event
contract
should
not
be
considered
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
cftc
stated
in
the
nadex
order
that
the
legislative
history
of
cea
section
indicates
congress
intent
to
restore
for
the
purposes
of
that
provision
the
economic
purpose
test
that
was
used
by
the
commission
to
determine
whether
a
contract
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest
pursuant
to
cea
section
prior
to
its
deletion
by
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
the
restored
economic
purpose
test
calls
for
an
evaluation
of
an
event
contract
utility
for
hedging
and
price
basing
purposes
as
discussed
above
the
proposed
event
contract
serves
the
economic
hedging
purposes
additionally
we
are
aware
of
the
extensive
research
that
has
been
performed
and
presented
to
the
commission
as
to
the
hedging
and
price
basing
functions
that
could
be
served
by
the
proposed
event
contract

although
the
cftc
noted
in
the
nadex
order
that
it
has
the
discretion
to
consider
other
factors
in
addition
to
the
economic
purpose
test
in
determining
whether
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
cftc
concluded
that
the
political
event
contracts
considered
in
the
nadex
order
could
potentially
be
used
in
ways
that
would
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
integrity
of
elections
for
example
by
creating
monetary
incentives
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
even
when
such
a
vote
may
be
contrary
to
the
voter
political
views
of
such
candidates
while
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
mis
incentives
could
arise
as
a
result
of
event
contracts
relating
to
particular
elections
the
underlying
question
of
the
proposed
event
contract
is
about
the
cumulative
results
of
hundreds
of
separate
elections
through
states
and
electoral
districts
in
the
united
states
the
combined
outcome
of
multiple
geographically
dispersed
elections
does
not
present
the
potential
risk
of
manipulation
that
is
at
least
potentially
present
in
a
contract
relating
to
a
single
smallscale
local
election
with
the
expected
margin
of
victory
within
relatively
few
voters
considering
the
various
public
policy
considerations
that
have
been
advocated
in
other
public
comment
letters
we
would
like
to
briefly
add
two
considerations
below
times
have
changed
society
has
changed
significantly
in
the
ten
years
since
the
nadex
order
was
released
we
now
live
in
a
truly
digital
age
the
largest
global
technology
companies
often
referred
to
as
bigtech
harvest
vast
amounts
of
data
from
their
platforms
to
generate
advanced
insights
into
various
areas
of
importance
including
the
likelihood
of
various
election
outcomes
in
a
data
driven
economy
meanwhile
the
explosive
growth
of
election
related
trading
on
illegal
or
unregulated
platforms
over
the
past
decade
demonstrates
the
strong
interest
that
the
public
has
in
election
related
contracts
and
the
economic
needs
that
these
contracts
fill
kalshi
allows
businesses
and
individuals
to
access
a
regulated
platform
responsive
to
their
needs
and
interests
the
public
interest
would
be
served
not
harmed
by
the
approval
of
the
proposed
event
contract
on
a
regulated
market
comparison
to
unregulated
alternatives
there
are
currently
two

in
addition
a
number
of
decentralized
prediction
market
platforms
are
also
available
to
residents
there
are
also
offshore
platforms
that
combine
traditional
sports
wagering
with
contracts
involving
politics
and
other
world
events
that
can
potentially
be
accessed
by
persons
through
the
use
of
a
virtual
private
network
none
of
these
platforms
are
required
to
comply
with
the
cftc
regulations
intended
to
protect
market
participants
from
manipulative
or
fraudulent
activity
nor
are
they
required
to
have
the
types
of
checks
and
mechanisms
needed
to
fight
market
manipulation
preserve
market
integrity
and
protect
retail
participants
that
the
kalshi
platform
implements
as
a
fully
regulated
and
demonstrably
compliant
marketplace
kalshi
will
take
direct
responsibility
for
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
kalshi
platform
and
the
welfare
of
the
predominantly
retail
traders
including
small
business
owners
that
are
expected
to
participate
moreover
all
contract
positions
on
the
kalshi
platform
are
limited
and
required
to
be
fully
cash
collateralized
leverage
and
margin
are
not
permitted
these
measures
will
help
protect
smaller
traders
against
significant
unexpected
losses
the
inclusion
of
the
proposed
event
contract
on
the
kalshi
platform
under
the
commission
oversight
would
greatly
enhance
the
integrity
of
the
election
contract
trading
market
in
the
united
states
and
would
protect
all
those
who
trade
in
it
kalshi
along
with
each
other
cftc
regulated
contract
market
must
comply
with
the
core
principles
delineated
in
the
cea
and
commission
regulations
at
a
high
level
the
core
principles
are
designed
to
ensure
market
integrity
and
protect
traders
from
fraud
and
abuse
having
election
contracts
under
the
commission
purview
would
replace
the
current
scene
of
susceptible
manipulatable
markets
with
the
strength
and
integrity
of
an
exchange
overseen
by
a
federal
regulator
iv
conclusion
the
proposed
event
contract
serves
a
clear
economic
purpose
that
meets
both
the
hedging
and
the
price
basing
needs
of
traders
with
a
commercial
interest
in
the
aggregate
outcome
of
the
midterm
elections
the
economic
benefits
of
the
proposed
event
contract
will
be
greatly
enhanced
if
it
is
permitted
to
trade
on
the
kalshi
platform
a
designated
contract
market
supervised
by
the
commission
moreover
to
the
extent
that
the
common
law
based
dominant
factor
test
is
applied
to
the
proposed
event
contract
the
outcome
of
traders
in
this
contract
will
not
be
derived
primarily
from
luck
or
chance
based
on
the
underlying
extrinsic
economic
utility
of
the
proposed
event
contract
to
be
available
on
the
kalshi
platform
the
regulatory
oversight
the
kalshi
dcm
will
be
subject
to
we
do
not
believe
that
the
proposed
event
contract
should
be
treated
as
involving
gaming
or
against
laws
or
otherwise
against
public
interest
and
should
be
approved
by
the
commission
