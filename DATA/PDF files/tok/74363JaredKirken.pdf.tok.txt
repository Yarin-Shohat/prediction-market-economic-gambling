i
am
writing
as
a
small
business
owner
to
express
my
opposition
to
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
election
markets
and
to
urge
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
stance
these
markets
offer
significant
benefits
particularly
in
terms
of
hedging
against
political
uncertainties
that
can
impact
small
businesses
like
mine
as
a
small
business
owner
i
am
acutely
aware
of
how
political
outcomes
can
directly
affect
my
operations
changes
in
policies
related
to
taxation
healthcare
and
regulation
can
have
substantial
implications
for
my
business
financial
health
election
markets
provide
a
valuable
tool
for
managing
these
risks
by
allowing
me
to
hedge
against
potential
adverse
outcomes
for
example
if
there
is
concern
that
a
particular
election
result
might
lead
to
increased
regulatory
burdens
or
changes
in
tax
policy
i
can
use
election
markets
to
offset
potential
financial
impacts
by
participating
in
these
markets
i
can
create
a
financial
buffer
that
helps
stabilize
my
business
in
the
face
of
uncertainty
much
like
how
larger
corporations
use
futures
markets
to
hedge
against
commodity
price
fluctuations
furthermore
operating
within
a
regulated
environment
on
platforms
like
kalshi
and
predictit
ensures
that
these
hedging
activities
are
secure
and
transparent
this
regulatory
oversight
protects
small
business
owners
from
the
risks
associated
with
unregulated
and
illegal
markets
such
as
fraud
and
market
manipulation
banning
election
markets
would
push
these
valuable
risk
management
tools
to
offshore
or
illegal
platforms
depriving
small
business
owners
of
the
protections
and
benefits
that
come
with
regulation
therefore
i
urge
the
cftc
to
recognize
the
importance
of
election
markets
for
small
businesses
and
to
support
their
operation
within
a
legal
and
regulated
framework
this
approach
will
not
only
enhance
market
efficiency
but
also
provide
small
business
owners
with
essential
tools
to
navigate
political
uncertainties
