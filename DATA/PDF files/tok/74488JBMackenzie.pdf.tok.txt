to

section
the
proposal
we
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
provide
comments
on
the
proposal
robinhood
derivatives
believes
the
proposal
is
far
too
broad
as
it
would
prohibit
certain
products
and
limit
product
innovation
for
which
the
cftc
should
not
have
concerns
as
such
we
believe
that
any
categorical
prohibition
that
prevents
the
listing
and
the
trading
of
futures
contracts
should
be
narrowly
tailored
to
achieve
a
defined
public
policy
goal
for
the
purposes
of
this
letter
we
will
focus
on
the
proposal
potential

on
the
broader
sporting

specifically
we
believe
that
1

the
proposal
lacks
sufficient
economic
analysis
given
the
breadth
of
the
proposal
and
3
the
proposal
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
the
cftc
has
not
properly
assessed
the
types
of

that
have
economic

would

in

this

has
been
at
the

increased
retail

in
the

in

they
have
worked
with

that
meet
the
needs
of

to

which
if
permitted
by
regulators
would
include
allowing
retail
participation
in
new
and
innovative
futures
contracts
ii
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
is
overly
broad
and
ambiguous
the
cftc
proposes
an
amendment

further
specify
types

in
particular
the
proposal
would
amend
cftc
regulation
to
specify
the
types
of
event
contracts
including
gaming
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
of
the

that
would
be
deemed
to
be
contrary
to
the

and
thus
prohibited
the

would
define

to
include
the

of

of

robinhood

opposes
the
proposal
in
that
it
broadly
and
unnecessarily
eliminates
the
possibility
of
event
contracts
for
any
sporting
events
the
commission
supports
this
broad
prohibition
based
on
the
following
colloquy
between
two
senators
feinstein
i
hope
it
is
the
senator
intent
as
the
author
of
this
provision
to
define
public
interest
broadly
so
that
the
cftc
may
consider
the
extent
to
which
a
proposed
derivative
contract
would
be
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
will
cftc
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative
as
opposed
to
a
hedging
or
economic
use
lincoln
that
is
our
intent
the
commission
needs
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivatives
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
supposed
event
contracts
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
these
types
of
contracts
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
used
solely
for
gambling

to

this

on
the

of

it
focused
on

of

related
to
the

there

that

financial
market
instruments
about
war
terrorism
and
assassination
we
also
believed
that
our
futures
markets
are
not
meant
for
gambling
and
so
we
also
gave
the
government
the
authority
to
prohibit
gambling
contracts
about
games
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
the
masters
tournament
but
outside
these
narrow
categories
the
law
is
clear
that
the

has
the
responsibility
to
regulate

the
cftc
however
has
not
supported
why
a
series
of
sporting
events
the
world
series
or
an
entire
season
can
not
be
used
by
commercial
or
institutional
participants
to
hedge
their
risk
take
for
example
the
los
angeles
lakers
and
consider
all
the
commercial
participants
that
must
manage
risks
related
to
whether
the
lakers
have
a
winning
season
advance
in
the
playoffs
or
advance
to
a
game
seven
in
a
playoff
series
first
the
lakers
have
a
lengthy
list
of
corporate
partners
and
sponsors
collectively
paying

and
the
lakers
home

each
of
these
commercial
participants
could
have
an
interest
in
hedging
their
risks
of
the
lakers
having
a
losing
season
but
the
commercial
participants
are
not
limited
to
big
corporate
sponsors
the
businesses
that
provide
services
to
the
lakers
including
stadium
vendors
companies
such
as
aramark
merchandise
sales
nearby
restaurants
hotels
and
bars
all
have
risks
related
to
whether
the
lakers
are
playing
well
a
commercial
risk
that
they
could
decide
to
hedge
a
former
nfl
player
andre
fluellen
agrees
that
restaurants
near
a
sports
stadium
may
have
an
incentive
to
hedge
their
risks
for
both
retail
participants
and
entities
there
are
only
limited
and
expensive
options
for
hedging
risk
based
on
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
an
event
but
an
event
contract
offers
legitimate
hedging
opportunities
for
those
who
may
not
have
another
means
to
do
so
for
example
a
restaurant
near
a
sports
stadium
may
want
to
hedge
the
possibility
of
cancellation
or
lower
attendance
that
would
impact
their
revenue
for
the
day
without
event
contracts
such
businesses
have
no
way
to
properly
manage
such
risks

even
an
individual
season
ticket
holder
who
sells
their
seats
to
others
during
the
season
has
a
commercial
reason
to
hedge
as
the
value
of
their
tickets
will
rise
and
fall
with
the
lakers
win
loss
record
just
as
a
farmer
can
hedge
his
her
exposure

a
bad
crop
yield
these
entities
and
persons
which
all
have
valuable
economic
interests
in
the
performance
of
sporting
venues
and
franchises
should
be
able
to
hedge
their
revenue
exposure
to

record
of

on
the

side

who
may
wish
to
attempt
to
profit
from
price
changes
in
futures
contracts
as
the
lakers
season
progresses
this
is
no
different
than
those
speculators

retail

who
buy
or
sell

robinhood

also
does
not
agree
that
political
event
contracts
can
not
be
tied
to
legitimate
risk
management
activities
because
history
has
shown

since

are

same
as
retail
traders

markets
they
are
looking
to
profit
from

robinhood

believes
that
retail
traders
should
be
free
to
speculate
on
sporting
events
as
they
do
any
of
the
current
futures
products
noted
above
robinhood
derivatives
believes
that
the
commission
must
perform
a
more
detailed
analysis
of
whether
the
breadth
of
its
prohibitions
on
certain
event
contracts
could
qualify
as
being
in
the
public
interest
as

ca
short
circuit
the
process
that
congress
established
by
determining
that
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
advance
and
without
knowing
the
contract
terms
and
conditions
simply
because
that
makes
things
easier
for
the
agency
89

the
correct
approach
here
would
be
to
narrow
the
definition
so
it
only
captures
single
events
directly
associated
with
sports
gambling
robinhood
derivatives
recommends
that
the
commission
revisit
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
so
it
does
not
capture
products
that
can
involve
legitimate
risk
management
and
speculative
activities
which
have
otherwise
been
permitted
by
the
cftc
for
decades
one
way
to
achieve
this
is
to
remove
the
last
clause
of
the
proposed
definition
which
would
capture
contracts
with
the
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
contests
or
games
by
removing
this
specific
section
we
believe
that
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
would
better
align
with
congressional
intent
to
prohibit
events
tied
to
a
single
specific
sporting
event
that
are
associated
with
gambling
activities
iii
the
commission
economic
analysis
is
flawed
the
commission
is
required
by
law
to
undertake
a
thorough
and
accurate
analysis
of
the
costs
and
benefits
that
the
proposal
would
impose
on
regulated
entities
and
the
economy

a
whole

the
commission
appears
to
believe
that
a
cost
benefit
analysis
should
be
based
on
the
commission
own
expected
costs
as
well
as
the
costs
of
winding
down
potential
existing
contracts
that
may
be
considered
non
compliant
nowhere
in
the
proposal
however
does
the
cftc
discuss
what
the
cost
benefit
analysis
would
be
for
market
participants
the
cftc
focuses
on
the
few
proposed
event
contracts
that
have
come
under
the
cftc
review
and
provides
an
inadequate
cost
benefit
analysis
in
these
limited
reviews
specifically
the
commission
estimates
that
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
comprised
less
than
1
of
the
total
trading
volume
in
event
contracts
in
2023
89
fr
at

indeed
the
cftc
admits
that
these
potentially
problematic
contracts
account
for
less
than
1
of
the
total
trading
volume
in
event
contracts
thereby
acknowledging
that
the
proposal
is
based
on
a
de
minimis
amount
of
participation
in
the
futures
marketplace
the
true
cost
of
the
proposal
would
fall
on
the
would
be
participants
and
new
entrants
to
the
market
that
would
be
precluded
from
entering
the
marketplace
because
of
the
proposal
this
includes
millions
of
retail
customers
seeking
to
engage
in
legitimate
speculative
activities
for
example
section

of

agency
certifies
that
the
rule
will
not
if
promulgated
have
a
significant
economic
impact
on
a
substantial
number
of
small
entities
the
proposal
however
assumes
incorrectly
that
the
only
impact
on
this
proposal
are
dcms
sefs
and
dcos
and
therefore
would
not
cover
small

89

we

the

that

cost

analysis
regarding
the

these

appears
to

excerpt
noted
above
using
the
resurrected
standard
robinhood
derivatives
believes
that
there
would
be
legitimate
economic
interests
for
these
contracts
beyond
gaming
and
the
cftc
should
let
market
participants
determine
what
these
event
contracts
are
if
cftc
regulated
entities
apply
the
standard
incorrectly
the
cftc
has
the
authority
and
tools
to
respond
accordingly
the
proposal
risks
stifling
innovation
in
the
derivatives
market
event
contracts
are
an
emerging
product
that
could
offer
unique
commercial
uses
for
hedging
and
risk
management
while
allowing
speculators
to
participate
in
such
markets
robinhood
derivatives
believes
that
the
proposal
would
deter
market
participants
from
developing
this
market
resulting
in
limited
growth
in
addition
the
cftc
has
supported
innovation
through
its
history
allowing
dcms
to
self
certify
new
products
if
they
believe
such
products
may
be
appropriate
in
the
futures
marketplace
for
example
through
the
self
certification
process
spot
bitcoin
futures
were
listed
and
now
provide
a
unique
marketplace
for
those
that
desire
to
hedge
or
obtain

the
self
certification
process
is
unique
to
the
futures
market
and
provides
innovation
to
occur
in
an
efficient
manner
if
the
market
believes
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
given
product
that
would
be
reflected
in
the
liquidity
for
that
product
indeed
the
proposal
does
not
raise
any
concerns
with
the
self
certification
process
and
we
believe
that
the
cftc
should
continue
to
permit
dcms
to
evaluate
potential
new
contracts
without
categorically
prohibiting
such
contracts
conclusion
although
we
recognize
the
cftc
intention
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
derivatives
market
we
believe
that
the
proposal
is
overly
broad
and
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
the
proposal
and
engage
in
further
dialogue
with
futures
markets
participants
and
retail
traders
to
develop
a
more
balanced
and
effective
regulatory
approach
specifically
consistent
with
congressional
intent
robinhood
derivatives
believes
the
commission
should
focus
on
prohibiting
single
sporting
events
or
contests
