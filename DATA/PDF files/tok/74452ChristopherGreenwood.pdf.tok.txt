proposed
congressional
control
contracts
under
cftc
regulation
my
name
is
tim
mcdermott
while
i
currently
the
ceo
of
teraexchange
a
swap
execution
facility
currently
applying
for
commission
registration
i
also
have
been
a
public
director
of
kalshi
since
2020
and
it
is
in
that
capacity
in
which
i
am
submitting
this
comment
prior
to
these
positions
i
held
a
variety
of
roles
at
nadex
between
2008
and
2019
including
as
ceo
general
counsel
and
as
a
board
member
and
then
even
earlier
with
compliance
at
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
more
than
ten
years
ago
i
was
a
critical
part
of
nadex
engagement
with
the
cftc
regarding
its
efforts
to
list
political
event
contracts
that
commission
in
my
view
made
the
wrong
decision
and
i
believe
the
events
of
the
last
decade
confirm
that
the
current
commission
should
take
a
different
approach
kalshi
contracts
are
compliant
with
the
law
and
very
clearly
would
provide
a
large
amount
of
social
value
in
the
form
of
hedging
price
basing
and
forecasting
below
i
address
the
cftc
seventeen
questions
in
detail
throughout
these
questions
there
appears
to
be
a
persistent
theme
whether
the
commission
should
impose
new
burdens
of
proof
on
political
event
markets
that
are
not
found
in
the
law
regulations
rules
or
commission
precedent
some
of
the
questions
asked
seem
to
extend
even
beyond
the
review
conducted
by
the
commission
during
the
consideration
of
nadex
political
event
contracts
and
more
recently
the
erisx
rsbix
futures
1
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
gaming
as
described
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
no
the
contracts
do
not
involve
relate
to
or
refer
to
gaming
neither
on
their
face
nor
tangentially
they
relate
to
a
federal
political
procedure
used
to
determine
leadership
in
each
chamber
of
the
united
states
congress
a
standard
political
procedure
with
clear
economic
consequences
there
is
no
definition
of
gaming
found
in
the
cea
or
the
regulations
or
rules
thereunder
however
the
commission
did
find
in
the
nadex
order
that
election
trading
constitutes
gaming
because
of
the
way
that
some
state
laws
define
gambling
or
wagering
which
it
found
to
be
identical
to
the
trading
of
an
event
contract
this
decision
was
i
believe
inconsistent
with
the
cea
and
the
commission
should
take
this
opportunity
to
correct
the
record
1
one
can
not
equate
event
contracts
that
turn
on
the
partisan
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
pro
tempore
with
gambling
prohibited
by
some
states
this
would
be
wrong
for
several
major
reasons
a
the
contract
does
not
involve
gaming
if
a
contract
were
to
ask
what
will
the
numbers
of
the
powerball
lottery
be
or
will
the
die
land
on
seven
those
would
involve
gaming
to
say
that
kalshi
contract
involves
gaming
because
trading
the
contract
is
gaming
would
be
a
misread
of
the
statute
if
the
commission
were
to
take
this
position
it
would
put
event
contracts
themselves
into
serious
jeopardy
since
many
states
prohibit
gambling
on
all
future
events
and
for
that
matter
taking
a
position
on
the
future
price
of
securities
and
commodities
this
would
have
to
mean
that
all
such
event
contracts
trigger
the
gaming
prong
this
is
a
point
made
persuasively
by
commissioner
quintenz
statement
on
erisx
rsbix
nfl
futures
which
i
will
return
to
to
this
end
the
2012
nadex
order
should
not
stand
and
the
commission
should
clarify
that
state
gambling
laws
do
not
force
event
contracts
by
their
very
nature
to
trigger
unlawful
activity
provision
at
the
end
of
the
day
this
is
a
plain
misinterpretation
of
the
relevant
provision
of
the
cea
i
the
relevant
portion
of
the
cea
notes
that
the
commission
may
prohibit
contracts
which
involve
i
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii
assassination
iv
war
v
gaming
or
vi
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
is
referring
to
the
activity
referenced
which
in
this
case
is
a
plainly
legal
activity
the
election
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
president
pro
tempore
this
is
true
for
all
election
contracts
elections
are
not
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
ii
the
interpretation
laid
out
in
the
nadex
order
requires
one
to
conclude
that
congress
was
defining
the
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
portion
differently
than
the
other
enumerated
activities
which
would
not
follow
since
the
contract
can
not
itself
constitute
terrorism
assassination
or
war
to
say
that
the
commission
ought
to
consider
whether
the
contract
itself
involves
unlawful
activity
because
trading
on
the
contract
is
unlawful
activity
which
it
is
not
is
not
in
or
implied
by
the
text
or
to
my
knowledge
congressional
discussion
of
the
law
b
there
are
qualitative
differences
between
an
event
contract
traded
on
a
cftc
registrant
and
the
kind
of
wagering
these
laws
refer
to
these
wagering
laws
patently
do
not
refer
to
a
cftc
traded
contract
given
their
ratification
well
before
the
commission
existence
and
their
irrelevance
as
the
cfma
actively
preempts
any
state
gambling
provisions
as
commissioner
quintenz
wrote
in
his
erisx
statement
i
whereas
bettors
participate
in
games
of
pure
chance
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
completely
reward
the
winner
and
punish
the
loser
for
an
outcome
that
would
otherwise
provide
no
economic
utility
think
roulette
speculators
in
the
derivatives
market
participate
in
non
chance
driven
outcomes
that
have
price
forming
impacts
upon
which
legitimate
businesses
can
hedge
their
activities
and
cash
flows
c
moreover
if
this
was
the
case
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
include
gaming
in
the
relevant
portion
of
the
cea
since
these
laws
refer
to
unlawful
activity
it
would
be
superfluous
to
include
an
additional
provision
targeting
gaming
commissioner
quintenz
argued
as
much
in
his
erisx
statement
i
if
the
statute
assumed
that
participating
in
any
event
contract
involved
making
a
wager
or
gamble
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contracts
upon
which
the
commission
could
make
a
public
interest
determination
2
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
whether
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
no
instead
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
contract
has
hedging
utility
price
basing
utility
and
economic
purpose
as
it
considered
in
the
nadex
decision
and
in
its
erisx
decision
as
noted
above
the
commission
would
be
confusing
trading
in
the
contract
with
the
underlying
activity
of
the
event
contract
the
commission
should
also
not
apply
a
novel
standard
to
determine
what
constitutes
gaming
that
being
said
this
contract
is
not
available
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
i
understand
that
similar
contracts
are
available
on
some
offshore
or
unregulated
platforms
but
that
fact
actually
mitigates
in
favor
of
approval
of
the
kalshi
contracts
a
regulated
market
should
be
available
to
provide
the
data
and
hedging
or
speculating
opportunities
that
so
many
users
clearly
seek
the
existence
of
willing
speculators
says
nothing
about
a
market
hedging
price
basing
utility
or
economic
purpose
speculators
play
a
willing
role
given
the
enormous
public
interest
in
political
outcomes
and
the
extensive
modeling
and
discussion
of
such
outcomes
in
the
public
sphere
because
of
their
great
import
it
seems
very
normal
to
expect
some
off
exchange
activity
especially
in
the
absence
of
an
on
exchange
alternative
3
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
no
the
only
activity
referenced
in
the
contract
is
the
party
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
senate
president
pro
tempore
the
commission
should
also
not
consider
state
laws
prohibiting
betting
or
wagering
on
the
outcomes
of
elections
in
this
context
for
many
of
the
reasons
discussed
above
why
the
same
laws
should
not
trigger
the
gaming
prong
although
there
are
other
reasons
too
1
kalshi

does
not

in

there
is
no
involvement
relation

to

gambling
or
betting
2
kalshi
contract
is
not
itself
election
gambling
under

laws
and
thus
does
not
involve
unlawful
activity
the
cfma
explicitly
provides
the
cftc
with
preemptive
authority
over
state
gambling
laws
thus
as
long
as
the
contract
is
certified
by
a
registrant
and
not
stopped
by
the
commission
the
contracts
are
lawful
there
is
no
situation
where
kalshi
offering
the
contracts
would
be
unlawful
because
of

gambling
provisions
a
if

since
many

on

and
for
that

wagering
on
the

price
of

this
would
imply
that
all
such

event
contracts
and

trigger

4
in
determining
whether
any
of
these
contracts
involves
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
should
the
commission
be
influenced
by
whether
state
laws
permit
betting
on
the
outcome
of
elections
or
other
political
outcomes
by
the
prohibition
of
interstate
betting
under
federal
law
as
discussed
above
i
believe
the
commission
should
not
be
so
influenced

5
are
the
contracts
substantively
different
than
nadex
previously
proposed
contracts
such
that
the
commission
analysis
should
be
different
for
reference
please
see
cftc
order
prohibiting
north
american
derivatives
exchange
political
event
derivatives
contracts
2
2012
available
at
as
the
former
chief
executive
officer
of
nadex
i
have
deep
experience
with
those
proposed
contracts
there
are
several
major
distinctions
between
nadex
event
contracts
and
these
1
the
position
limits
are
ten
times
lower
kalshi
are
whereas
nadex
proposed
limits
while
i
believe
that
the
levels
proposed
by
nadex
were
and
would
still
be
appropriate
i
note
that
the
commission
has
accepted
election
markets
social
value
conditional
on
low
position
limits
in
the
cases
of
iowa
electronic
markets
and
predictit
kalshi
market
is
an
additional
step
in
that
direction
to
promote
liquidity
and
accurate
pricing
simultaneously
addressing
commission
concerns
but
also
providing
value
for
market
participants
2
circumstances
since
the
nadex
order
have
changed
materially
this
is
an
important
point
for
the
commission
to
consider
the
cftc
has
permitted
new
products
over
time
as
circumstances
changed
such
as
the
first
cash
settled
index
futures
in
the
1970s
and
the
first
bitcoin
binary
options
in
2015
and
bitcoin
futures
in
2017
the
currently
relevant
changed
circumstances
include
a
the
no
action
letter
for
predictit
from
2014
predictit
traded
more
than
billion
contracts
in
its
time
without
as
far
as
i
am
aware
any
concern
from
states
regarding
possible
violation
of
their
laws
or
regarding
election
integrity
hundreds
of
millions
were
traded
on
the
2020
election
by
american
traders
it
appears
the
commission
recognized
there
was
some
social
value
in
election
trading
in
issuing
the
predictit
no
action
letter
it
even
permitted
increased
position
limits
from
iowa
electronic
markets
levels
thus
even
the
commission
seems
to
have
acknowledged
in
the
recent
past
that
with
some
position
limits
the
benefits
of
election
trading
outweigh
the
harms
kalshi
proposal
is
the
next
step
in
that
thinking
as
stated
above
b
new
unregulated
decentralized
exchanges
using
blockchain
technology
the
commission
does
not
have
the
resources
and
in
some
cases
not
even
the
means
to
shut
down
these
exchanges
designed
to
evade
government
regulation
as
detailed
by
the
technology
advisory
committee
in
its
december
2020
meeting
in
order
to
drive
liquidity
away
from
these
exchanges
and
protect
consumers
the
commission
should
champion
the
opportunity
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
bringing
activity
under
cftc
and
american
oversight
while
simultaneously
taking
the
wind
out
of
the
sails
of
unregulated
exchanges
and
reducing
the
burden
on
enforcement
c
the
growth
of
election
trading
in
general
in
addition
to
predictit
and
new
decentralized
exchanges
offshore
platforms
like
betfair
have
seen
record
volumes
every
election
cycle
this
is
a
problem
that
is
growing
not
going
away
the
commission
should
not
wait
10
years
to
return
to
this
problem
when
it
clear
that
this
activity
should
be
under
its
oversight
it
should
be
proactive
not
reactive
i
individuals
at
the
end
of
the
day
have
incredibly
large
exposure
to
election
risk
as
that
risk
and
the
public
awareness
of
that
risk
increases
and
as
the
economy
becomes
more
specialized
expect
legitimate
hedging
and
price
basing
interest
to
continue
to
grow
the
commission
should
not
risk
kicking
the
can
down
the
road
until
another
set
of
staff
and
commissioners
have
to
deal
with
this
problem
it
is
truly
ii
in
the
interest
of
the
cftc
and
the
public
to
address
this
problem
now
by
making
reasonable
attempts
to
bring
the
activity
under
a
legal
registrant
with
constraints
as
kalshi
has
proposed
if
the
cftc
has
ideas
for
other
reasonable
controls
it
should
allow
these
contracts
to
be
listed
and
work
proactively
with
kalshi
on
those
ideas
d
the
increased
awareness
of
risk
caused
by
elections
compared
to
the
there
seems
to
be
even
more
financial
and
academic
discussion
regarding
the
impacts
that
election
probabilities
have
on
financial
assets
even
before
the
election
occurs
investment
banks
regularly
publish
public
research
and
report
to
clients
on
the
risks
they
face
and
discuss
how
to
hedge
them
financial
publications
like
cnbc
regularly
talk
about
the
impact
that
election
odds
and
politics
have
on
the
market
6
do
the
contracts
serve
a
hedging
function
are
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
based
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedged
directly
by
the
contracts
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrates
the
hedging
utility
of
the
contracts
1
yes
these
contracts
can
serve
a
hedging
function
political
control
is
something
that
has
massive
economic
consequences
throughout
all
industries
and
the
macroeconomy
broadly
2
yes
these
contracts
are
predictable
enough
in
order
to
assess
this
question
examples
of
how
elections
pose
risk
and
how
the
contracts
can
be
used
for
hedging
are
very
useful
and
very
telling
but
perhaps
even
more
telling
is
the
amount
of
hedging
that
is
currently
ongoing
in
the
market
based
on
my
personal
experience
banks
and
other
financial
advisors
frequently
advise
clients
and
the
public
on
the
risks
that
come
directly
from
elections
the
prices
of
financial
assets
regularly
move
because
of
election
outcomes
as
reported
on
in
the
financial
press
for
example
here
this
has
also
been
repeatedly
verified
by
economists
and
social
science
although
policies
are
enacted
well
after
elections
themselves
take
place
expectations
about
policy
change
are
imputed
into
the
prices
of
assets
immediately
if
the
market
is
already
pricing
assets
and
hedging
election
risk
the
commission
is
not
in
a
position
to
conclude
the
opposite
a
however
i
should
note
that
predictable
enough
is
not
a
standard
found
in
the
law
or
regulations
or
even
the
economic
purpose
test
b
predictable
enough
is
also
a
standard
that
would
fail
to
comport
with
how
hedging
works
hedging
is
not
necessarily
a
direct
dollar
for
dollar
offset
of
the
future
change
in
the
value
of
an
asset
one
holds
for
example
a
weather
contract
common
to
exchanges
like
cme
cantor
fitzgerald
and
kalshi
addresses
uncertain
risk
a
hurricane
could
cause
significant
damage
power
outages
or
no
damage
at
all
to
the
hedger
in
the
same
vein
although
the
economic
impacts
of
an
election
outcome
on
assets
and
cash
flows
are
not
certain
they
are
real
real
enough
that
the
market
already
engages
in
hedging
and
price
basing
behavior
based
off
these
risks
clearly
qualifying
for
risk
mitigation
products
offered
by
a
commission
regulated
exchange
7
are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
yes
an
example
of
this
is
a
firm
or
household
which
depends
on
government
subsidies
or
benefits
which
another
party
has
committed
to
either
give
or
take
away
should
it
be
elected
there
is
no
other
mechanism
for
such
a
firm
or
household
to
hedge
such
risks
if
derivative
products
for
the
firm
in
question
do
exist
then
there
is
no
mechanism
by
which
to
do
this
i
will
also
note
that
political
control
contracts
in
as
much
as
this
could
happen
could
be
a
far
superior
hedge
than
the
alternatives
described
in
this
question
1
market
participants
especially
less
sophisticated
investors
may
not
be
able
to
determine
whether
the
specific
event
risks
already
have
been
priced
into
the
relevant
products
participants
may
try
to
hedge
using
these
but
the
risk
has
already
been
priced
in
resulting
in
zero
value
for
the
would
be
hedger
this
is
a
value
add
of
kalshi
proposed
contractprice
discovery
for
the
public
2
these
products
carry
risks
other
than
political
control
risk
thus
hedging
may
not
be
effective
for
this
purpose
if
other
risks
destroy
the
value
of
the
hedge
however
i
do
appreciate
that
this
question
acknowledges
that
these
risks
are
inputted
into
the
prices
of
other
derivative
products
the
price
basing
case
for
these
contracts
is
incredibly
strong
any
trader
will
acknowledge
that
who
holds
control
of
the
senate
and
house
matters
deeply
for
oil
and
pharma
stocks
among
many
others
as
commissioner
berkovitz
wrote
in
his
erisx
statement
price
basing
is
an
equivalent
justification
for
these
products
as
hedging
further
the
question
fails
to
appreciate
the
value
of
diverse
opportunities
in
our
markets
there
is
nothing
in
the
cea
that
says
one
contract
per
risk
the
question
seems
to
suggest
that
if
there
are
other
contracts
that
can
hedge
specific
risk
then
this
contract
will
not
likely
be
used
for
hedging
this
too
is
inconsistent
with
the
cea
what
contracts
market
participants
utilize
is
for
each
participant
to
decide
it
would
be
wrong
for
the
commission
to
attempt
to
pick
a
winner
in
terms
of
which
contracts
market
participants
should
be
allowed
to
use
to
accomplish
their
goals
or
about
how
specific
contracts
will
be
used
potentially
in
concert
with
those
other
available
market
tools
8
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
in
reviewing
the
contact
hedging
function
is
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
used
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrated
need
by
likely
hedgers
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
used
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participants
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedging
use
the
commission
should
use
the
economic
purpose
test
that
was
referred
to
in
both
nadex
and
contracts
that
have
hedging
price
basing
utility
because
the
contract
refers
to
an
economic
event
should
be
permitted
on
designated
contract
markets
to
my
knowledge
the
commission
has
never
required
that
a
registrant
actually
provide
evidence
of
a
hedger
using
their
platform
for
a
new
contract
under
review
nor
could
the
registrant
since
the
contract
is
not
live
it
contrary
to
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
has
previously
used
creating
a
new
standard
that
suggests
there
must
be
prelisting
proof
of
a
sufficient
number
of
hedgers
compared
to
speculators
and
others
would
be
arbitrary
has
not
been
required
in
the
past
and
is
not
part
of
the
cea
or
the
rules
or
regulations
thereunder
further
the
implied
framework
would
be
unworkable
and
have
a
chilling
effect
on
all
innovation
in
this
space
if
not
completely
kill
it
the
implied
framework
would
require
an
exchange
that
is
looking
to
bring
an
innovative
product
to
market
to
create
and
demonstrate
the
hedging
demand
for
a
particular
product
before
it
even
traded
that
completely
misapprehends
the
reality
of
the
marketplace
and
all
but
guarantees
that
no
innovation
will
occur
9
should
the
commission
consider
contract
and
position
sizes
and
the
exchange
intended
customer
base
to
help
assess
whether
a
product
is
likely
to
be
used
for
hedging
in
at
least
some
cases
are
very
small
dollar
value
contracts
targeted
at
individual
retail
customers
likely
to
have
hedging
utility
for
such
customers
when
the
contracts
offer
positions
on
macro
level
national
political
events
does
whether
contracts
are
margined
or
fully
collateralized
affect
this
analysis
1
the
commission
should
not
be
determining
whether
a
product
is
likely
to
be
used
for
hedging
that
is
not
a
standard
included
or
implied
in
the
cea
there
are
also
serious
concerns
about
the
commission
or
indeed
anyone
ability
to
read
the
tea
leaves
to
determine
with
great
certainty
what
the
market
will
be
for
a
certain
product
that
is
antithetical
to
the
cea
approach
that
the
market
should
decide
indeed
how
many
contracts
have
experienced
exchanges
launched
with
great
fanfare
and
hope
over
the
years
only
to
see
them
rejected
by
the
marketplace
2
the
commission
should
not
consider
contract
and
position
sizes
and
the
exchange
intended
customer
base
to
assess
the
product
hedging
utility
a
such
a
standard
would
be
flawed
since
any
exchange
user
base
can
be
fluid
over
time
and
moreover
the
user
base
of
this
contract
is
not
yet
available
to
the
commission
to
know
since
it
is
not
listed
to
say
that
kalshi
traders
are
primarily
retail
traders
says
nothing
of
the
hedging
value
of
this
contract
in
particular
b
the
standard
that
the
commission
has
previously
used
in
this
regard
is
economic
purpose
in
the
form
of
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
the
fact
that
speculation
may
exist
is
completely
irrelevant
to
the
question
in
front
of
the
commission
3
the
contract
has
a
size
of
1
in
order
to
make
itself
readily
available
to
retail
customers
along
with
a
position
limit
low
position
limits
on
other
exchanges
like
cme
micro
futures
are
very
normal
retail
traders
as
well
as
small
and
medium
sized
businesses
who
benefit
from
these
position
limits
the
commission
must
remember
do
have
significant
risk
from
elections
they
are
affected
deeply
by
government
policy
just
as
much
as
big
businesses
are
however
they
are
unable
to
mitigate
that
same
risk
a
position
limits
are
not
static
and
can
change
kalshi
entrance
into
the
event
contract
space
began
and
has
remained
with
low
position
limits
compared
to
traditional
commodity
futures
exchanges
however
that
could
change
for
any
contract
pending
new
information
about
the
market
and
the
needs
of
actors
seeking
to
hedge
in
the
space
this
point
demonstrates
why
actual
predicted
use
is
not
an
appropriate
standard
in
this
context
it
would
not
allow
for
change
and
responsible
innovation
that
should
be
expected
of
any
4
whether
the
contract
is
margined
or
fully
collateralized
may
affect
this
analysis
but
kalshi
does
not
offer
margined
trading
so
this
would
appear
to
be
a
moot
point
at
this
time
it
should
not
consider
this
but
could
at
a
later
date
10
should
the
commission
consider
the
contract
design
and
payout
when
trying
to
assess
the
economic
utility
of
the
contract
for
example
are
binary
contracts
useful
for
hedging
nonbinary
economic
events
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
contract
can
be
used
to
hedge
or
be
used
as
a
basis
for
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
the
question
is
not
if
they
will
be
used
for
hedging
or
price
basing
nor
is
it
if
this
is
the
only
way
to
hedge
or
the
only
information
that
will
go
into
a
price
the
thing
that
the
commission
should
look
at
is
whether
the
contract
could
be
used
for
hedging
or
as
a
basis
in
pricing
the
commission
should
not
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
market
and
the
commission
should
not
try
to
predict
the
future
development
of
a
contract
additionally
the
example
offered
in
the
question
is
not
relevant
to
the
contracts
here
the
event
in
question
is
binary
either
a
party
will
or
will
not
control
the
chamber
of
congress
this
is
a
very
natural
fit
for
that
risk
according
to
market
participants
and
it
is
how
risk
is
discussed
among
those
involved
although
that
event
has
myriad
economic
impacts
in
many
industries
that
is
the
case
with
all
event
contracts
as
well
as
futures
11
do
the
contracts
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
yes
the
prices
of
financial
assets
regularly
move
because
of
election
outcomes
as
reported
on
in
the
financial
press
this
has
also
been
repeatedly
and
widely
verified
by
economists
and
social
science
in
addition
investment
banks
frequently
publish
reports
to
their
clients
and
the
public
detailing
movements
in
stocks
and
bonds
based
on
expectations
about
changes
in
political
control
12
are
the
proposed
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
why
or
why
not
as
noted
the
cea
makes
this
question
relevant
only
to
contracts
whose
underlying
activities
are
enumerated
in
section
because
the
activity
underlying
the
contracts
at
issue
are
not
enumerated
there
the
question
is
not
relevant
here
insofar
as
the
nadex
order
concluded
the
nadex
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
i
disagreed
with
that
analysis
i
believe
that
this
commission
should
not
find
that
the
kalshi
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
indeed
the
contracts
are
strongly
in
the
public
interest
in
addition
to
their
hedging
utility
and
price
basing
utility
the
forecasting
data
generated
by
these
contracts
is
enormous
and
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
have
this
forecasting
data
the
value
created
by
firms
trying
to
model
election
outcomes
to
the
public
such
as
the
new
york
times
the
economist
and
fivethirtyeight
extensive
americans
have
an
extremely
large
interest
in
this
probability
a
forecast
created
by
the
market
can
outperform
traditional
polling
and
other
forecasting
methods
giving
the
public
an
enormous
social
service
in
the
nadex
order
the
commission
worried
that
the
contracts
would
create
perverse
incentives
to
vote
switch
in
order
to
improve
the
odds
of
their
contract
paying
out
in
my
opinion
this
was
not
a
sufficient
reason
to
conclude
that
the
nadex
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
reasoning
would
be
even
less
persuasive
with
respect
to
kalshi
contracts
given
the
changed
circumstances
and
contracts
since
the
nadex
order
1
the
suggestion
that
market
participants
would
be
incentivized
to
switch
votes
was
speculative
in
fact
experience
from
history
and
foreign
nations
suggests
that
any
such
concern
regarding
this
issue
is
without
foundation
because
of
the
prevalence
of
election
trading
abroad
in
the
united
kingdom
in
ireland
australia
and
other
liberal
democraciesand
here
in
the
united
states
over
the
past
30
years
iem
intrade
predictit
etc
i
believe
the
commission
would
really
need
to
provide
some
empirical
evidence
of
such
activity
before
raising
this
concern
with
respect
to
these
contracts
2
the
creation
of
predictit
in
2014
the
commission
clearly
believed
despite
the
then
recent
nadex
order
that
with
some
position
limit
these
contracts
are
socially
valuable
this
is
merely
the
next
step
in
that
evolution
if
the
commission
believes
a
different
position
limit
is
appropriate
it
should
engage
kalshi
on
that
basis
3
these
contracts
are
trading
enormous
amounts
already
in
addition
to
the
large
stakes
that
individuals
already
have
in
election
outcomes
independent
of
exchanges
proper
however
the
concerns
regarding
manipulation
and
election
integrity
expressed
at
other
points
throughout
these
questions
are
all
the
worse
on
unregulated
platforms
that
lack
know
yourcustomer
authorization
position
limits
surveillance
compliance
with
the
core
principles
and
commission
oversight
in
order
to
promote
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
encourage
the
listing
of
these
contracts
on
a
regulated
dcm
like
kalshi
13
could
the
trading
of
these
or
other
political
control
or
election
based
contracts
affect
the
integrity
of
elections
or
elections
within
the
chamber
of
congress
could
it
affect
the
perception
of
the
integrity
of
elections
within
the
chamber
of
congress
no
1
the
party
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
pro
tempore
is
well
known
before
the
actual
event
takes
place
because
it
is
determined
in
practice
by
looking
at
which
party
holds
the
most
seats
in
the
relevant
chamber
the
trading
of
the
proposed
contracts
would
not
affect
that
practice
individual
candidates
are
not
relevant
for
kalshi
contract
only
the
party
and
that
is
already
determined
by
the
time
the
house
and
senate
are
electing
the
speaker
and
president
pro
tempore
2
the
rules
of
the
contract
will
preclude
members
of
congress
from
trading
these
contracts
and
members
have
their
own
obligations
to
avoid
conflicts
of
interest
and
are
required
to
go
through
extensive
financial
reporting
that
can
reveal
such
conflicts
of
interest
3
these
contracts
are
already
traded
on
in
large
volumes
and
they
are
critically
growing
the
commission
should
make
sure
that
activity
is
happening
under
its
oversight
and
with
the
full
protections
that
being
a
registrant
provides
accordingly
to
the
extent
that
the
kalshi
contract
has
any
impact
with
respect
to
election
integrity
and
public
perception
it
will
be
to
increase
confidence
not
decrease
it
14
could
the
contracts
facilitate
violations
of
or
otherwise
undermine
federal
campaign
finance
laws
or
regulations
for
example
could
the
contracts
make
it
easier
to
sidestep
prohibitions
governing
coordination
between
candidate
campaign
committees
and
political
action
committees
no
candidly
i
do
not
really
understand
this
question
the
kalshi
contracts
change
neither
the
incentives
of
a
candidate
and
a
pac
to
coordinate
nor
the
means
for
them
to
do
so
these
markets
are
merely
an
informational
and
hedging
tool
not
something
that
could
increase
coordination
between
those
two
groups
15
do
the
contracts
present
any
special
considerations
with
respect
to
susceptibility
to
manipulation
or
surveillance
requirements
for
example
could
candidate
campaign
committees
or
political
action
committees
manipulate
the
contracts
by
trading
on
internal
non
public
polling
data
kalshi
contracts
do
not
present
any
special
considerations
in
this
regard
rather
these
contracts
present
standard
considerations
that
kalshi
has
addressed
through
its
own
rules
against
manipulation
and
its
prohibition
against
politically
exposed
persons
their
families
and
close
associates
from
trading
on
political
contracts
16
should
campaign
committees
political
action
committees
candidates
for
the
house
and
senate
and
other
entities
involved
in
political
fundraising
and
expenditures
or
likely
to
hold
non
public
information
or
subject
to
federal
election
commission
oversight
be
prohibited
from
participating
in
the
contracts
would
such
a
prohibition
help
address
federal
campaign
law
or
manipulation
and
surveillance
concerns
how
would
such
restrictions
impact
the
commission
determination
of
whether
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
kalshi
has
protections
against
manipulation
and
actively
prohibits
politically
exposed
persons
their
families
and
close
associates
from
trading
on
political
contracts
including
this
i
would
suggest
however
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
contract
no
pac
candidate
or
campaign
committee
likely
holds
meaningful
information
or
influence
on
the
outcome
of
all
the
house
and
senate
elections
that
lead
to
control
of
congress
that
would
require
prohibitions
additional
to
what
kalshi
has
imposed
any
such
concerns
however
should
not
impact
the
commission
determination
of
whether
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
stated
above
17
what
other
factors
should
the
commission
consider
in
determining
whether
these
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
ought
to
consider
the
contract
hedging
utility
price
basing
utility
forecasting
value
to
the
public
and
ability
to
bring
unregistered
activity
to
a
registrant
promoting
consumer
protections
and
reducing
the
burden
on
enforcement
