comments
by
professors
with
expertise
in
the
sports
industry
on
the
cftc
proposed
rulemaking
barring
sports
futures
markets
the
undersigned
are
professors
who
research
and
teach
about
the
legal
economic
and
business
aspects
of
the
sports
industry
for
the
reasons
set
forth
below
we
believe
that
a
blanket
prohibition
on
sports
events
futures
trading
is
precipitous
the
proposed
rulemaking
fails
to
consider
the
potential
public
interest
benefits
that
such
a
market
innovation
would
create
instead
the
commission
should
render
its
public
interest
determination
of
a
carefully
crafted
sports
futures
market
pursuant
to
its
general
regulatory
authority
to
review
specific
futures
contract
trading
we
defer
to
others
regarding
a
detailed
assessment
of
the
commission
authority
raised
by
commissioners
mersinger
and
pham
other
than
to
conclude
that
our
own
review
of
the
sources
cited
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
persuades
us
that
the
text
and
legislative
history
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
gives
the
commission
the
authority
to
recognize
the
public
interest
benefits
of
sports
futures
trading
and
to
assess
whether
these
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
to
the
public
interest
and
the
administrative
costs
of
approving
and
overseeing
sports
futures
markets
we
are
concerned
that
a
blanket
prohibition
on
sports
futures
through
this
rulemaking
proceeding
will
prevent
innovations
with
potential
to
serve
two
important
public
interests
first
as
with
other
futures
markets
a
sports
futures
market
allows
firms
that
make
substantial
investments
reliant
for
their
profitable
return
on
the
success
of
a
particular
sports
team
such
as
sponsors
media
companies
and
businesses
adjacent
to
sports
events
to
hedge
their
investment
this
hedging
allows
these
firms
as
well
as
sports
clubs
and
leagues
to
increase
investment
second
and
of
perhaps
greater
importance
sports
futures
promote
critical
transparency
allowing
both
private
actors
and
public
policymakers
to
assess
market
trends
and
to
increase
the
accountability
of
market
actors
the
latter
is
particularly
important
where
as
is
typical
in
the
sports
industry
vigorous
competition
either
in
the
product
market
or
in
the
market
for
corporate
control
is
not
available
to
facilitate
this
accountability
because
the
issues
concerning
sports
futures
are
quite
distinct
from
those
raised
by
event
contracts
involving
elections
wars
or
other
world
events
we
recommend
that
any
rulemaking
exclude
sports
futures
and
that
the
distinctive
issues
raised
by
sports
futures
should
instead
be
considered
in
the
context
of
a
proceeding
on
application
of
one
or
more
proposed
sports
futures
market
organizers

futures
markets
serve
an
undervalued
public
interest
in
promoting
transparency
although
the
primary
public
interest
in
lawful
commodities
trading
is
to
create
a
reliable
market
for
those
involved
in
the
production
and
sale
of
commodities
to
hedge
risks
of
market
volatility
an
under
valued
interest
is
that
futures
markets
also
promote
critical
transparency
a
reliable
futures
market
allows
private
actors
to
assess
market
trends
and
make
more
informed
investment
decisions
promoting
the
effective
working
of
free
markets
futures
markets
also
provide
critical
information
to
public
policy
makers
who
can
assess
the
extent
to
which
as
judge

competitive
markets
firms
are
adopting
policies
that
disserve
their
customers
and

they

in

at
a

the

anticompetitive

of

the
goals
of
the
cea
would
be
to
carefully
consider
the
benefits
and
harms
of
sports
futures
betting
in
the
context
of
specific
proposals
2
the
cftc
is
not
constrained
by
text
or
legislative
history
in
recognizing
the
public
benefits
in
sports
futures
even
if
these
markets
will
invite
some
investment
for
entertainment
purposes
the
relevant
statutory
provision
of
the
cea
authorizes
the
commission
to
prohibit
certain
event
contracts
from
being
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
if
such
contracts
involve
an
activity
that
is
enumerated
in
cea
section
or
other
similar
activity
as
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
and
the
commission
determines
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
broad
power
granted
to
the
cftc
to
make
a
public
interest
declaration
is
confirmed
in
the
legislative
history
cited
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
when
this
section
was
added
to
the
statute
in
2010
the
chair
of
the
relevant
senate
committee
blanche
lincoln
expressly
informed
her
colleagues
that
the
provision
objective
was
to
give
the
cftc
the
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
futures
and
swaps
markets
that
would
allow
citizens
to
profit
from
devastating
events
and
also
prevent
gambling
through
futures
markets

we
emphasize
that
lincoln
did
not
state
that
the
provision
would
require
the
cftc
to
prevent
whatever
she
thought
might
be
gambling
through
futures
markets
when
combined
with
the
statutory
authorization
it
is
clear
as
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
states
elsewhere
that
the
commission
makes
a
two
step
determination
as
to
whether
it
has
jurisdiction
over
certain
financial
instruments
and
whether
to
ban
such
instruments
if
their
marketing
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nothing
cited
by
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
indicates
that
congress
intended
to
either
make
its
own
public
interest
determination
that
any
event
contracts
with
aspects
similar
to
gaming
should
be
prohibited
or
that
the
cftc
lacked
the
authority
to
balance
the
benefits
we
articulate
above
against
various
considerations
suggesting
that
these
contracts
might
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
similarly
the
notice
points
to
a
colloquy
between
lincoln
and
feinstein
reflecting
feinstein
apparent
concerns
with
situations
where
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative

even
here
these
leading
senators
are
clear
that
the
text
was
being
drafted
to
give
the
cftc
the
power
to
block
these
contracts
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nothing
in
this
colloquy
suggests
that
either
through
rulemaking
or
individualized
assessments
the
cftc
was
required
to
make
such
a
finding
thus
even
though
the
notice
currently
observes
that
the
utility
of
a
contract
or
category
contracts
for
purposes
of
hedging
and
price
basing
are
relevant
factors
in
the
public
interest
determination
there
is
no
support
in
text
or
history
for
the
conclusion
that
these
are
the
only
factors
it
would
be
unfortunate
if
the
cftc
were
to
construe
the
text
and
legislative
intent
as
requiring
the
commission
to
make
a
binary
choice
between
good
contracts
where
the
predominant
effect
is
to
permit
firms
to
hedge
investments
and
bad
contracts
where
the
predominant
effect
is
speculative
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
distinctive
case
of
sports
futures
in
our
view
there
will
be
three
simultaneous
effects
of
sports
futures
contract
trading
1
it
will
allow
hedging
by
those
who
make
investments
whose
return
is
significantly
affected
by
sporting
events
also
likely
increasing
the
willingness
of
sponsors
media
rights
purchasers
luxury
box
purchasers
and
others
to
make
these
investments
bringing
further
revenue
into
sports
2
it
will
promote
greater
transparency
about
the
likely
success
of
clubs
who
draw
upon
consumer
loyalty
and
thus
greater
accountability
for
leagues
and
club
owners
and
3
it
will
attract
speculative
investment
by
those
who
as
in
traditional
commodities
futures
markets
believe
that
they
can
profit
by
a
shrewd
assessment
of
market
trends
even
if
from
a
quantitative
standpoint
the
speculative
aspect
can
be
said
to
predominate
this
does
not
mean
that
the
benefits
from
hedging
and
transparency
are
insufficient
to
render
these
markets
in
the
public
interest
other
language
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
could
be
read
to
suggest
that
any
futures
market
that
might
attract
investors
seeking
to
trade
for
entertainment
purposes
should
be
prohibited
this
would
be
an
unfortunate
overreach
to
imaginatively
illustrate
suppose
a
television
reality
show
akin
to
dancing
with
the
stars
featured
celebrities
spending
time
with
those
who
earn
their
living
trading
pork
belly
futures
and
the
ensuing
popularity
led
americans
to
choose
for
their
own
entertainment
to
invest
in
these
markets
because
these
markets
serve
important
interests
the
fact
that
part
of
the
demand
for
investment
is
based
on
entertainment
would
not
radically
change
the
public
interest
determination
the
statute
requires
the
commission
to
make
notwithstanding
this
ambiguous
rhetoric
in
the
notice
it
eventually
concludes
with
an
understanding
consistent
with
the
text
and
legislative
history
the
commission
will
consider
all
relevant
factors
in
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
there
is
no
one
factor
that
will
be
determinative
in
the
commission
evaluation
notice
at
43
the
transparency
benefits
of
sports
futures
are
a
relevant
factor
that
warrants
the
commission
consideration
and
the
concern
that
sports
futures
investment
could
be
motivated
by
gaming
or
entertainment
motivations
can
not
be
determinative
3
a
proceeding
is
the
preferred
process
to
explore
if
effective
regulation
of
sports
futures
markets
significantly
minimizes
market
distortions
we
do
not
claim
that
the
benefits
in
investment
hedging
and
increased
transparency
necessarily
outweigh
the
risks
to
the
public
interest
from
efforts
by
unscrupulous
individuals
to
distort
decision
for
profits
in
futures
market
trading
we
do
suggest
that
an
individualized
assessment
in
the
90
day
review
period
set
forth
in
of
the
cftc
regulations
would
be
a
better
way
for
the
cftc
to
determine
whether
sports
futures
trading
is
in
the
public
interest
we
recognize
the
concern
expressed
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
that
the
proposed
amendments
would
reduce
the
frequency
of
event
contract
submissions
to
the
commission
that
raise
potential
public
interest
concerns
which
would
allow
for
more
efficient
use
of
commission
and
staff
resources
by
reducing
the
need
to
conduct
individualized
event
contract
reviews
pursuant
to
the
administration
of
the
cea
is
not
within
our
expertise
but
it
can
not
be
that
any
type
of
regulated
instrument
that
would
raise
potential
public
interest
concerns
should
be
banned
by
rulemaking
to
avoid
costly
individualized
reviews
the
time
consuming
nature
of
individualized
reviews
could
be
avoided
in
the
future
if
in
the
context
of
a
review
the
commission
were
to
determine
that
all
or
virtually
all
event
contracts
involving
sports
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
the
cftc
has
yet
to
make
such
a
determination
and
it
can
best
do
so
by
undertaking
the
sound
investment
of
time
and
resources
into
a
few
individualized
reviews
before
reaching
the
broad
conclusion
that
as
a
category
all
sports
event
futures
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
although
for
some
investors
sports
futures
trading
has
similarities
to
gaming
the
investments
differ
in
important
ways
event
contracts
can
be
limited
to
economically
relevant
longer
term
events
rather
than
a
single
contest
or
a
spot
bet
on
a
single
sporting
event
the
careful
tracking
of
investments
only
made
through
registered
brokers
makes
detection
of
market
manipulation
far
easier
than
even
regulated
gambling
markets
the
penalties
for
market
manipulation
in
futures
markets
are
far
more
severe
more
significantly
the
risks
of
compulsive
gambling
can
also
be
policed
more
effectively
in
sports
futures
than
in
sports
gambling
as
the
identity
of
the
investor
is
harder
to
disguise
and
those
who
should
not
be
allowed
to
participate
either
because
of
industry
involvement
or
because
of
compulsive
tendencies
can
be
more
readily
enforced
4
the
public
interest
analysis
for
election
futures
differs
from
sports
futures
in
four
fundamental
respects
first
the
risks
of
election
distortion
are
far
greater
than
the
risks
that
sporting
competitions
will
be
distorted
by
futures
trading
there
already
exists
a
massive
sports
gambling
market
that
creates
incentives
for
unscrupulous
individuals
to
distort
markets
no
such
market
exists
regarding
elections
second
there
is
a
distinctive
public
interest
in
a
functioning
democracy
where
voters
cast
ballots
for
candidates
whose
policies
they
prefer
not
candidates
whose
victories
will
profit
them
in
a
futures
market
there
is
no
such
interest
or
concern
if
a
lifelong
yankee
fan
chooses
to
short
the
yankees
or
go
long
on
the
red
sox
and
therefore
decides
to
cheer
for
tanner
houck
to
strike
out
aaron
judge
as
opposed
to
judge
hitting
a
home
run
over
the
green
monster
similarly
as
feinstein
noted
in
legislative
debate
there
is
a
particular
public
interest
concern
with
contracts
that
would
allow
someone
to
profit
from
events
that
threaten
our
national
security

no
such
concerns
are
present
when
someone
profits
from
the
long
term
success
of
a
sports
team
third
the
transparency
benefits
provided
by
sports
futures
markets
are
far
greater
than
those
of
election
futures
politics
already
features
significant
transparency
as
rival
candidates
the
media
and
pervasive
public
polling
provide
citizens
with
the
assessment
of
trends
and
the
sort
of
information
that
futures
markets
provide
political
competition
provides
ample
opportunity
without
the
need
for
a
futures
market
for
a
rival
candidate
to
persuade
voters
to
oust
the
incumbent
office
holder
no
such
mechanism
existed
for
fans
and
consumers
to
oust
daniel
snyder
as
the
owner
of
the
nfl
franchise
in
the
nation
capital
area
sports
futures
in
contrast
could
identify
trends
that
would
facilitate
pressure
from
sponsors
fans
and
potential
new
ownership
to
lead
to
responsive
changes
finally
those
with
investments
at
risk
have
existing
markets
in
which
to
hedge
losses
caused
by
election
results
but
no
such
markets
exist
for
sports
investments
conclusion
the
cftc
should
amend
the
proposed
rule
to
exclude
sports
futures
event
contracts
from
its
blanket
prohibition
and
it
should
consider
the
many

interest
issues
raised
by
