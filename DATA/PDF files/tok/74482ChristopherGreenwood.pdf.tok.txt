appreciate

as

i
write
to
provide
my
formal
comments
on
the
proposed
rule
pr

which

introduction
our
derivatives
markets
are
crucial
for
the
american
economy
as
you
know
they
allow
businesses
and
individuals
alike
to
hedge
risks
express
market
views
and
discover
prices
without
these
markets
we
struggle
to
effectively
and
efficiently
manage
economic
risks
and
remain
competitive
i
am
deeply
troubled
by
the
recent
proposal
put
forth
by
the
cftc
the
federal
agency
that
is
tasked
with
administering
the
cea
in
prohibiting
broad
categories
of
contracts
the
cftc
proposal
relies
heavily
on
a
2010
senate
colloquy
between
me
and
the
late
senator
feinstein
for
support
but
the
cftc
proposal
goes
well
beyond
what
we
intended
this
heavy
handed
proposal
to
ban
markets
rather
than
regulating
them
risks
undermining
the
core
principles
that
underpin
our
financial
markets
principles
we
strived
to
uphold
through
carefully
crafted
legislation
that
encourages
innovation
and
provides
consumer
protections
of
course
there
are
instruments
that
should
not
be
traded
on
any
financial
market
instruments
about
war
terrorism
and
assassination
might
be
inappropriate
for
the
markets
this
is
precisely
why
we
included
rules
in
the
cea
that
give
the
government
authority
to
prohibit
contracts
about
war
terrorism
and
assassination
we
also
believed
that
our
futures
markets
are
not
meant
for
gambling
and
so
we
also
gave
the
government
the
authority
to
prohibit
gambling
contracts
about
games
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
the
masters
tournament
but
outside
these
narrow
categories
the
law
is
clear
that
the
cftc
has
the
responsibility
to
regulate
contracts
not
ban
them
now
however
the
cftc
is
attempting
to
prohibit
all
sorts
of
financial
instruments
from
instruments
that
have
any
relation
to
sports
such
as
attendance
and
ratings
of
a
championship
game
to
instruments
involving
political
elections
to
contracts
about
the
nobel
prize
as
the
cftc
sees
it
these
are
gaming
contracts
and
therefore
fall
under
the
prohibition
we
drafted
in
2010
however
it
is
my
view
that
this
interpretation
entirely
misses
the
mark
the
law
was
meant
to
capture
recreational
gambling
on
sporting
events
and
casino
type
activities
not
the
nobel
prize
in
physics
or
the
outcome
of
major
elections
these
events
are
nothing
like
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
or
the
masters
tournament
if
we
had
intended
to
include
these
events
we
would
have
done
so
explicitly
we
did
not
because
those
events
unlike
the
result
of
a
sports
match
have
real
and
significant
economic
consequences
prohibiting
futures
contracts
on
those
events
would
therefore
inhibit
the
sort
of
legitimate
economic
activity
that
our
markets
are
designed
to
promote
further
it
would
push
this
existing
legal
economic
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
markets
with
little
to
no
consumer
protections
by
defining
gaming
so
broadly
the
cftc
proposed
rule
casts
a
dangerous
shadow
over
the
entire
industry
speculating
has
risks
but
it
is
not
recreational
gambling
taking
a
position
on
a
future
event
with
commercial
significance
in
a
commercial
manner
is
not
recreational
gambling
consider
a
small
business
owner
for
example
who
owns
a
sports
bar
in
a
city
whose
baseball
team
is
doing
well
if
they
hire
more
staff
in
anticipation
of
their
team
making
it
far
into
the
playoffs
with
the
accompanying
packed
nights
at
the
bar
they
have
not
gambled
rather
they
have
made
a
prudent
speculative
and
commercial
investment
for
a
real
economic
purpose
buying
a
contract
that
pays
out
if
their
team
falls
short
of
the
playoffs
is
gambling
either
this
is
a
prudent
investment
that
allows
the
bar
owner
to
hedge
their
risk
of
a
potential
economic
loss
if
the
team
season
does
go
as
hoped
or
let
consider
someone
who
is
bullish
on
the
prospects
of
a
new
technology
who
invests
in
companies
that
are
developing
that
hardware
or
software
they
have
not
gambled
either
they
have
invested
in
a
speculative
position
how
about
a
farmer
or
a
rancher
that
speculates
on
the
future
price
of
rice
corn
or
cattle
on
the
futures
markets
they
are
certainly
not
gambling
the
opportunity
to
hedge
risk
should
not
be
limited
to
the
wealthiest
individuals
and
corporations
who
can
access
these
types
of
innovative
risk
management
products
through
large
investment
banks
under
the
cftc
proposed
rule
sensible
commercial
activity
would
be
categorized
and
prohibited
as
gambling
that
does
only
blur
the
lines
between
gambling
and
legitimate
commercial
activity
it
obliterates
it
the
foundational
premise
of
the
cftc
new
rule
is
that
it
equates
all
legitimate
commercial
speculative
activity
with
gambling
the
early
history
of
markets
was
replete
with
similar
accusations
that
markets
were
nothing
but
gambling
dens
that
accusation
has
since
been
disproven
by
the
unparalleled
economic
growth
made
possible
by
our
financial
markets
and
especially
by
our
derivatives
markets
american
futures
markets
are
strong
and
resilient
and
they
support
a
strong
and
resilient
economy
the
strength
and
vitality
of
our
markets
rest
on
two
fundamental
pillars
robust
regulation
and
broad
participation
the
role
of
regulators
is
absolutely
crucial
the
ftx
collapse
clearly
illustrates
what
happens
without
strong
regulator
intervention
the
cftc
proposal
to
prohibit
markets
is
not
regulating
them
it
is
a
failure
to
regulate
this
is
the
opposite
of
what
i
intended
with
dodd
frank
my
intention
was
to
create
a
robust
framework
for
regulating
markets
not
ban
entire
markets
i
am
proud
of
what
our
work
on
this
financial
reform
legislation
accomplished
and
i
am
hopeful
the
cftc
will
reconsider
its
current
proposal
on
event
contracts
ii
specific
points
of
concern
the
cftc
proposal
misinterprets
my
colloquy
on
several
key
points
definition
of
gaming
the
cftc
proposed
definition
of
gaming
misinterprets
the
intent
of
my
2010
senate
colloquy
the
cftc
rule
proposes
to
classify
trades
as
gaming
based
on
the
subject
of
the
trade
trades
that
are
on
a
specific
subject
and
the
cftc
identifies
four
subjects
are
classified
as
gaming
and
trades
on
other
subjects
are
not
gaming
that
means
that
the
dividing
line
between
gaming
and
how
the
cftc
defines
the
opposite
of
gaming
is
simply
the
subject
of
the
trade
in
the
cftc
proposal
the
only
distinction
the
cftc
is
proposing
between
gaming
and
economic
trading
is
what
the
subject
of
the
trade
is
looking
at
the
trader
the
facility
the
ecosystem
surrounding
the
trade
is
irrelevant
for
the
cftc
to
argue
that
the
only
discerning
difference
between
gaming
activity
and
economic
trading
activity
is
the
subject
of
the
bet
is
contrary
to
my
intent
in
the
statutory
provisions
of
dodd
frank
contrary
to
the
experience
of
the
industry
and
contrary
to
my
2010
colloquy
under
the
cftc
proposal
gaming
encompasses
three
topics
none
of
which
are
in
the
statute
we
drafted
and
none
of
which
are
in
my
colloquy
with
senator
feinstein
instead
the
cftc
proposes
to
adopt
definitions
of
gambling
from
unrelated
laws
and
at
this
the
proposal
is
misguided
the
intent
of
the
statute
was
never
to
establish
taboo
topics
that
are
gambling
the
intent
of
the
statute
was
to
give
the
cftc
authority
to
distinguish
between
gambling
for
entertainment
and
economic
trading
the
dividing
line
between
recreational
gambling
and
economic
trading
that
occurs
on
derivatives
markets
is
not
the
subject
of
the
trade
it
is
the
activity
the
activity
that
we
intended
to
keep
out
of
the
futures
markets
is
recreational
gambling
for
entertainment
the
gaming
that
we
referred
to
in
the
statute
describes
a
recreational
activity
that
is
for
entertainment
the
cftc
proposal
to
define
gaming
simply
based
on
the
subject
of
the
trade
is
contrary
to
my
intent
you
may
remember
that
in
our
2010
colloquy
we
specifically
highlighted
the
super
bowl
people
gamble
on
who
will
win
the
super
bowl
and
the
event
has
enormous
economic
consequences
that
can
create
risk
that
can
be
hedged
managed
and
transferred
one
event
like
the
super
bowl
can
be
the
subject
of
both
gambling
and
legitimate
economic
activity
the
difference
between
the
two
is
that
economic
trading
is
not
done
for
recreation
and
gambling
for
entertainment
is
for
recreation
the
cftc
proposal
to
define
gaming
solely
based
on
the
subject
of
the
trade
abandons
the
regulatory
responsibility
to
investigate
and
ascertain
the
financial
utility
and
purpose
of
economic
trading
it
calls
the
legitimacy
of
all
derivatives
markets
into
question
this
was
not
my
intent
and
is
contrary
to
our
colloquy
in
addition
to
the
concerns
with
the
cftc
overall
proposed
definition
of
gaming
the
specific
definitions
it
proposes
are
also
questionable
the
cftc
proposal
looked
to
the
dictionary
definition
of
gambling
but
the
proposal
ignored
the
obvious
and
intended
definition
to
play
a
game
for
money
in
fact
nearly
every
definition
of
gaming
which
is
the
word
we
used
in
the
statute
incorporates
the
idea
of
playing
a
game
the
gambling
that
we
referred
to
in
our
colloquy
was
clear
on
this
point
and
that
is
why
we
used
the
examples
like
the
super
bowl
the
cftc
incredibly
broad
proposal
to
sweep
up
events
like
elections
and
the
nobel
prize
for
physics
in
the
definition
of
gaming
goes
way
too
far
elections
are
not
games
i
think
that
now
at
this
time
in
history
it
is
especially
apparent
that
elections
are
not
games
blanket
prohibitions
the
cftc
proposes
a
blanket
prohibition
on
all
contracts
that
have
as
their
subject
one
of
the
activities
we
enumerated
in
the
statute
as
opposed
to
contract
specific
determinations
this
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
most
certainly
contrary
to
my
intent
the
statute
is
intended
to
give
the
cftc
authority
to
make
determinations
about
specific
contracts
that
are
listed
not
adopt
blanket
prohibitions
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
the
derivatives
markets
is
the
presumption
that
the
market
not
the
government
should
be
choosing
how
they
hedge
their
risks
what
data
to
ingest
and
what
to
trade
it
is
not
the
government
role
to
be
picking
winners
and
losers
in
our
financial
markets
our
intent
with
the
provisions
of
dodd
frank
were
to
recognize
that
there
may
be
instances
where
an
event
contract
should
not
be
listed
but
these
instances
are
narrow
only
if
the
cftc
determines
that
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
a
specific
contract
prohibited
that
determination
must
be
made
on
a
contract
by
contract
basis
we
are
living
in
a
time
of
significant
global
unrest
does
it
make
sense
that
the
cftc
can
foresee
that
every
event
contract
that
related
to
the
subject
of
war
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
did
not
suggest
that
every
single
contract
which
referenced
war
would
forever
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
we
did
we
would
have
forbidden
those
contracts
altogether
but
that
is
not
how
we
approached
the
issue
congress
said
that
event
contracts
on
the
enumerated
activities
may
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
cftc
proposal
to
ban
entire
categories
of
contracts
and
not
make
a
contract
by
contract
determination
of
public
interest
is
inconsistent
with
what
we
intended
in
the
statute
purpose
of
the
derivatives
markets
i
am
particularly
concerned
by
the
cftc
interpretation
of
the
derivatives
industry
concepts
of
hedging
price
formation
price
basing
and
speculating
in
justifying
its
blanket
ban
over
contracts
that
fit
its
proposed
definition
of
gaming
the
cftc
says
that
the
commission
believes
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
others
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
including
the
outcome
of
such
contest
or
game
generally
is
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
price
of
commodities
or
other
financial
assets
or
instruments
limiting
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
an
event
contract
involving
such
an
occurrence
the
cftc
therefore
believes
that
the
outcome
of
an
election
for
example
does
not
pose
risk
to
market
participants
that
can
be
hedged
this
is
simply
untrue
elections
have
enormous
economic
impacts
and
pose
enormous
economic
risks
to
all
sorts
of
parties
from
individuals
to
small
businesses
to
trade
associations
to
large
corporations
the
reasoning
that
the
cftc
uses
to
conclude
that
event
contracts
will
have
limited
hedging
utility
and
pricebasing
utility
is
mistaken
the
derivatives
markets
are
successfully
used
to
hedge
by
transferring
risk
risk
is
not
limited
to
changes
in
the
price
of
some
commodity
it
is
much
broader
than
that
dodd
frank
itself
is
a
testament
to
the
complexity
of
the
economy
and
the
risks
of
a
complex
and
interconnected
global
economy
the
cftc
assumption
that
elections
do
pose
direct
financial
risks
is
false
and
its
dismissal
of
the
broader
risks
associated
with
elections
is
wrong
too
risks
that
market
participants
face
however
diffuse
can
be
effectively
managed
by
transferring
the
risk
using
event
contracts
additionally
the
cftc
ignores
one
of
the
historical
uses
of
the
derivatives
markets
the
derivatives
markets
have
historically
been
utilized
as
aggregators
of
market
sentiment
prices
form
as
participants
express
their
opinion
on
the
market
and
the
data
is
used
by
the
marketplace
as
a
gauge
of
market
sentiment
event
contracts
provide
a
very
useful
mechanism
for
the
market
to
express
their
opinion
on
future
events
the
data
that
can
come
from
these
event
contracts
or
prediction
exchange
contracts
can
be
very
valuable
and
it
is
a
hallmark
of
the
derivatives
industry
that
market
participants
can
decide
what
information
is
useful
to
them
and
what
is
not
useful
similarly
the
cftc
concern
that
the
information
the
market
would
be
using
to
determine
its
view
of
a
fair
price
differs
from
the
informational
sources
used
for
pricing
the
vast
majority
of
commodities
underlying
commission
regulated
derivatives
contracts
government
issued
crop
forecasts
weather
forecasts
federal
government
economic
data
market
derived
supply
and
demand
metrics
for
commodities
market
based
interest
rate
curves
is
misplaced
although
the
cftc
does
not
fully
articulate
what
the
exact
significance
of
this
difference
is
the
implication
is
that
the
price
basing
process
wo
work
for
event
contracts
this
underestimates
the
broad
inputs
that
markets
use
to
price
many
traditional
commodities
such
as
oil
and
gold
where
participants
use
broad
inputs
to
determine
future
market
prices
and
predict
future
market
demand
these
inputs
are
much
greater
than
the
price
of
the
spot
market
commodity
this
is
certainly
true
for
equity
index
futures
most
importantly
it
ignores
the
power
of
american
markets
and
their
adeptness
at
ingesting
information
the
cftc
premise
there
is
insufficient
reliable
information
to
form
prices
is
unfortunately
misguided
all
this
reasoning
is
used
in
the
cftc
proposal
to
support
the
conclusion
that
contracts
it
proposes
to
classify
as
gaming
such
as
election
contracts
will
not
be
used
for
hedging
or
price
basing
this
is
untrue
elections
do
pose
risks
and
individuals
and
businesses
should
have
a
means
to
hedge
that
risk
it
is
not
credible
to
say
that
data
on
what
the
market
thinks
about
the
likely
outcome
of
elections
is
not
incredibly
economically
important
i
hope
that
the
cftc
remembers
the
early
days
of
some
of
the
other
products
it
regulates
and
the
lessons
that
it
learned
markets
take
time
to
develop
speculators
play
an
incredibly
important
role
in
that
development
american
markets
are
very
well
functioning
and
perhaps
most
importantly
it
the
markets
that
should
decide
which
contracts
succeed
the
cftc
should
let
the
markets
thrive
under
careful
oversight
and
consumer
protections
iii
conclusion
as
our
economy
becomes
ever
more
complex
the
risks
that
events
pose
to
a
broad
range
of
market
participants
becomes
more
acute
it
is
critical
to
have
the
ability
to
manage
a
wide
variety
of
risks
and
to
aggregate
market
sentiment
the
derivatives
