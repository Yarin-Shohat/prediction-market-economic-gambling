i
am
writing
to
offer
my
views
on
the
proposed
rules
concerning
event
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
definitions
the
current
definitions
especially
for
gaming
are
too
broad
and
lack
specificity
this
could
lead
to
unintended
consequences
where
legitimate
market
activities
are
inadvertently
included
within
the
scope
of
regulation
for
instance
a
contract
that
includes
a
performance
bonus
based
on
a
team
victory
in
a
sporting
event
could
be
misclassified
as
gaming
under
the
proposed
rule
to
avoid
ambiguity
i
suggest
refining
the
definitions
with
clear
examples
and
criteria
that
distinguish
between
regulated
and
non
regulated
activities
the
commission
should
express
openness
to
revisiting
the
definition
of
gaming
as
it
gains
more
experience
with
this
regulatory
area
scope
of
regulation
the
scope
of
regulation
should
be
clearly
defined
to
prevent
overreach
it
is
essential
to
establish
what
is
explicitly
included
and
excluded
from
the
rule
to
ensure
that
it
targets
only
those
contracts
that
pose
a
risk
to
market
integrity
or
public
interest
for
example
contracts
that
involve
speculative
bets
on
unpredictable
events
should
be
included
while
those
that
are
part
of
standard
business
operations
should
be
excluded
a
measured
approach
is
necessary
to
balance
consumer
protection
with
market
efficiency
the
rule
should
be
flexible
enough
to
adapt
to
changing
market
conditions
while
providing
clear
guidelines
for
market
participants
provide
a
process
for
addressing
new
classes
of
contracts
no
one
can
anticipate
all
the
classes
of
events
contracts
that
may
arise
such
as
new
types
of
hybrid
contracts
to
accommodate
new
developments
in
financial
products
without
stifling
innovation
the
cftc
should
build
in
a
process
for
reviewing
and
approving
new
categories
of
event
contracts
this
process
should
involve
an
advisory
committee
with
diverse
representation
and
a
structured
public
comment
period
to
gather
input
from
all
stakeholders
small
wager
predictive
markets
are
socially
valuable
and
should
not
be
impeded
predictive
markets
particularly
those
limited
to
modest
wagers
offer
a
range
of
social
benefits
that
contribute
to
their
overall
value
and
utility
these
markets
serve
as
a
form
of
collective
intelligence
where
the
aggregated
predictions
of
a
diverse
group
of
individuals
can
lead
to
more
accurate
forecasts
than
any
single
expert
could
provide
and
there
is
a
long
history
of
predictive
markets
that
provides
useful
experience
and
sheds
light
on
how
they
can
operate
safely
and
effectively
a
tolerant
approach
toward
small
wager
predictive
markets
has
many
benefits
first
predictive
markets
aggregate
information
from
a
wide
array
of
participants
each
with
their
own
unique
insights
and
perspectives
this
collective
wisdom
can
lead
to
more
informed
decision
making
and
better
outcomes
second
by
allowing
individuals
to
wager
small
amounts
predictive
markets
distribute
risk
across
a
larger
pool
of
participants
reducing
the
potential
impact
on
any
single
individual
third
participants
in
predictive
markets
are
incentivized
to
contribute
their
knowledge
and
opinions
which
can
lead
to
increased
engagement
and
participation
in
various
social
and
economic
activities
fourth
predictive
markets
can
enhance
market
efficiency
by
providing
real
time
data
on
public
sentiment
and
expectations
which
can
be
valuable
for
businesses
policymakers
and
researchers
finally
these
markets
encourage
innovation
by
providing
a
platform
for
new
ideas
and
hypotheses
to
be
tested
and
validated
through
collective
betting
cftc
should
carve
out
light
regulation
for
small
stakes
predictive
markets
because
in
general
the
benefits
outweigh
the
risks
and
the
risks
are
minimized
with
appropriate
licensing
striking
a
sound
balance
in
general
it
is
important
to
strike
a
balance
between
regulation
and
freedom
over
regulation
could
stifle
the
very
innovation
and
efficiency
that
these
markets
provide
therefore
it
is
crucial
to
implement
a
regulatory
framework
that
protects
participants
from
fraud
and
manipulation
while
allowing
the
market
to
operate
freely
within
reasonable
bounds
they
should
not
be
subject
to
over
regulation
but
rather
be
supported
with
a
regulatory
framework
that
ensures
fairness
and
integrity
this
does
not
mean
that
there
should
be
a
wild
west
mentality
just
because
something
is
proposed
does
not
mean
that
it
will
not
have
negative
externalities
promote
undue
financial
risk
allow
money
laundering
and
other
illegal
activities
or
result
in
unintended
consequences
