dear
chairman
on
thursday
june
27
i
along
with
many
other
americans
tuned
in
to
watch
a
debate
i
was
dreading
with
both
potential
presidents
so
widely
disliked
my
overall
outlook
on
the
country
future
as
a
whole
and
my
expectations
for
this
specific
debate
were
extremely
low
both
candidates
still
somehow
managed
to
disappoint
me
one
candidate
lied
through
his
teeth
would
answer
questions
about
how
to
solve
addiction
and
refused
to
commit
to
accepting
election
results
if
he
lost
he
put
on
a
disgraceful
show
completely
disregarding
the
mere
concept
of
honesty
and
making
weird
comments
about
black
jobs
i
could
never
feel
comfortable
voting
for
this
man
it
was
the
other
candidate
though
who
stole
the
show
and
broke
my
heart
he
struggled
to
complete
a
sentence
could
properly
outline
any
cogent
points
and
generally
looked
like
someone
on
death
door
while
i
happily
voted
for
this
man
four
years
ago
i
could
never
feel
comfortable
voting
for
him
to
take
charge
of
the
next
four
years
i
ended
this
debate
knowing
that
if
either
of
these
men
were
to
be
elected
in
november
the
country
would
suffer
this
suffering
however
could
take
many
different
forms
there
was
also
the
chance
that
another
candidate
would
come
forward
and
completely
change
the
set
of
options
american
citizens
will
face
in
the
face
of
so
many
unknowns
and
such
little
hope
i
searched
for
solace
the
issue
however
was
where
to
look
for
an
accurate
portrayal
of
what
we
as
a
nation
could
expect
i
could
ask
friends
and
family
but
like
all
americans
these
days
i
know
i
live
in
an
ideological
bubble
and
i
unlikely
to
learn
anything
about
the
nation
feelings
as
a
whole
by
talking
to
people
who
are
inherently
very
similar
to
me
i
could
turn
to
the
media
who
have
the
means
to
gather
information
much
more
widely
than
i
can
but
this
is
the
same
media
that
literally
goes
to
the
spin
room
a
place
where
surrogates
for
the
candidates
are
given
nearly
free
reign
to
lie
and
obfuscate
whatever
happened
in
the
debate
to
the
american
people
pundits
and
anchors
on
the
major
networks
are
much
better
the
modern
practice
of
balance
often
means
that
the
talking
heads
on
tv
are
effectively
partisan
hacks
but
this
practice
is
seen
as
acceptable
so
long
as
the
network
puts
on
a
few
hacks
who
are
democrats
and
a
few
who
are
republicans
i
needed
a
source
of
information
about
our
nation
future
that
was
limited
to
my
own
ideological
bubble
and
that
was
put
forth
by
an
entity
that
is
incentivized
to
tell
an
interesting
story
or
support
a
specific
view
more
than
it
is
to
convey
the
truth
i
needed
a
source
of
information
where
people
predicting
things
about
our
future
are
incentivized
only
to
be
accurate
because
they
must
put
their
money
where
their
mouth
is
i
needed
predictit
on
predictit
site
i
saw
the
mind
of
the
nation
i
saw
a
president
of
the
united
states
having
already
secured
almost
every
delegate
from
his
party
nomination
process
down
to
a
50
probability
of
winning
his
own
party
nomination
the
number
went
up
and
down
but
it
never
went
back
up
to
the
pre
debate
number
of
about
85
and
largely
settled
at
about
65
until
july
2
when
it
again
plummeted
as
the
party
started
to
abandon
him
i
thought
more
about
that
85
number
an
incumbent
president
with
almost
every
delegate
pledged
to
support
him
in
his
party
nomination
process
was
sitting
pre
debate
at
under
90
in
a
prediction
market
asking
if
he
would
make
it
across
the
nomination
finish
line
with
under
two
months
to
go
the
market
thought
there
was
a
real
chance
about
one
in
six
that
he
would
flame
out
i
had
spent
four
years
discounting
that
15
chance
rooted
in
concerns
about
biden
health
as
a
right
wing
conspiracy
theory
i
was
certain
that
if
he
wanted
it
biden
would
be
a
shoe
in
for
the
nomination
but
had
i
thought
about
it
more
seriously
i
might
have
figured
out
that
there
was
a
reason
that
the
market
believed
in
a
15
chance
he
would
be
nominated
i
might
have
realized
the
excuses
i
had
been
making
for
him
he
has
a
stutter
he
just
old
those
videos
are
selectively
edited
were
indeed
nothing
more
than
excuses
the
market
with
its
15
was
right
and
i
was
wrong
since
the
reality
check
that
was
the
debate
i
will
be
relying
more
than
ever
on
predictit
markets
to
give
me
information
about
where
we
as
a
nation
are
most
likely
headed
their
markets
are
a
rare
gem
in
that
they
are
able
to
provide
information
that
is
widely
sourced
and
incentivized
for
accuracy
above
all
else
this
is
what
the
cftc
wants
to
take
away
from
americans
this
is
what
they
want
to
deprive
us
of
on
regulated
exchanges
the
cftc
has
been
on
a
crusade
to
shut
down
these
markets
starting
in
2022
when
they
pulled
the
predictit
nal
then
when
they
illegally
prevented
kalshi
from
posting
their
congressional
markets
and
now
with
this
absurd
rulemaking
i
read
the
rule
and
it
makes
zero
sense
the
rule
posits
that
elections
are
gaming
and
therefore
deserving
of
a
ban
because
some
people
call
them
contests
and
some
definitions
of
gambling
ignoring
that
gambling
and
gaming
are
by
no
means
synonyms
use
the
word
contest
this
is
absurd
this
logic
is
so
tortured
that
it
becomes
painfully
obvious
that
the
cftc
just
wanted
to
ban
these
markets
and
desperately
searched
for
a
definition
that
would
do
it
it
is
plainly
clear
that
all
securities
and
commodities
are
tied
to
contests
in
some
way
does
anyone
truly
believe
that
tesla
is
in
a
contest
to
sell
more
of
its
cars
than
byd
or
that
indonesia
is
in
a
contest
with
australia
to
export
the
most
nickel
to
propose
that
contests
are
gaming
and
should
therefore
be
banned
would
effectively
ban
all
trading
on
all
securities
and
commodities
this
notion
is
utterly
ridiculous
the
rulemaking
proposal
also
never
bothers
to
address
the
concept
that
gaming
the
key
word
upon
which
they
are
deeming
markets
on
elections
bannable
inherently
refers
to
a
game
we
know
from
prior
cftc
documents
mostly
the
kalshi
order
that
the
cftc
thinks
some
event
contracts
and
commodities
are
not
games
because
they
have
economic
effects
to
say
that
an
election
is
a
game
and
that
markets
on
elections
are
gaming
is
to
say
that
elections
do
not
have
economic
effects
this
assertion
is
so
thoroughly
incorrect
that
the
highly
paid
lawyers
and
economists
at
the
cftc
should
be
ashamed
to
put
it
forward
no
reasonable
person
would
believe
that
elections
do
have
economic
effects
every
single
campaign
speech
or
party
platform
contains
multiple
examples
of
concrete
policy
proposals
that
would
have
major
economic
impacts
if
implemented
during
the
tragic
debate
on
june
27
i
managed
to
sort
through
some
of
the
incoherent
ramblings
and
learn
a
little
bit
about
what
the
two
presidential
candidates
stood
for
biden
talked
about
raising
taxes
on
the
wealthy
to
fund
medicare
and
social
security
trump
talked
about
imposing
tariffs
on
goods
from
china
trump
talked
about
extending
the
2019
tax
cuts
biden
talked
about
raising
the
corporate
tax
rate
to
pay
for
childcare
and
elder
care
these
are
clearly
concrete
and
direct
economic
impacts
the
consumer
product
safety
commission
a
sister
agency
to
the
cftc
recently
proposed
a
rule
that
would
require
table
saws
to
have
the
ability
to
automatically
retract
upon
contact
with
a
finger
i
a
product
engineer
who
regularly
works
with
equipment
like
this
the
cost
of
upgrading
this
equipment
can
run
into
the
hundreds
of
dollars
per
device
and
some
companies
will
have
hundreds
or
even
thousands
of
saws
would
it
be
helpful
if
those
companies
could
see
the
odds
that
they
would
have
to
spend
potentially
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
new
equipment
and
to
be
able
to
hedge
directly
against
that
possibility
is
this
a
clear
case
of
why
knowledge
about
future
policy
decisions
is
important
to
the
public
interest
the
cftc
can
not
deny
that
a
rule
about
table
saws
is
real
and
affects
relevant
businesses
their
crusade
against
political
event
contracts
demonstrates
how
divorced
they
are
from
how
actual
businesses
work
and
interact
with
regulatory
bodies
congress
has
outlined
a
two
step
process
for
banning
a
contract
1
determine
that
it
is
part
of
an
enumerated
category
and
2
determine
that
it
is
against
public
interest
the
cftc
proposed
rule
completely
bulldozes
this
process
by
presuming
that
the
cftc
has
the
power
to
rule
a
contract
as
gaming
and
after
doing
so
need
not
do
any
of
the
required
analysis
to
classify
it
as
against
the
public
interest
this
completely
bastardizes
congress
process
and
instead
allows
the
cftc
to
make
arbitrary
and
capricious
decisions
that
will
not
withstand
judicial
scrutiny
can
a
room
full
of
cftc
lawyers
seriously
say
that
not
one
of
them
has
opened
predictit
to
check
biden
odds
since
the
debate
is
it
not
in
the
public
interest
for
people
to
know
who
their
next
leaders
will
be
will
the
cftc
really
delegate
this
monumental
task
to
the
spin
room
pundits
who
are
not
incentivized
to
be
accurate
but
instead
are
incentivized
to
sell
interesting
stories
if
i
had
listened
to
what
the
market
was
telling
me
a
year
ago
i
would
have
been
so
shocked
by
what
i
saw
on
june
27
i
would
have
been
able
to
make
adjustments
to
my
future
plans
maybe
including
my
stock
portfolios
which
include
a
lot
of
green
energy
stocks
that
will
crash
if
trump
wins
in
november
prior
to
the
debate
the
information
was
there
even
if
i
was
ready
to
hear
it
markets
are
important
the
cftc
knows
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
thought
i
was
smarter
than
a
market
and
it
is
the
first
time
that
i
was
wrong
what
matters
is
that
i
had
a
way
to
know
that
my
preconceived
notions
were
wrong
the
source
of
unbiased
information
was
there
it
was
on
predictit
predictit
markets
are
a
valuable
public
service
and
are
quite
clearly
in
the
public
interest
i
also
far
from
the
only
one
who
sees
their
value
in
the
recent
turmoil
that
has
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
june
27
debate
the
new
york
times
the
wall
street
journal
bloomberg
and
the
financial
times
have
all
written
articles
citing
predictit
markets
as
a
valuable
source
of
unbiased
information
amongst
the
tumult
i
object
to
this
absurd
rulemaking
which
will
never
in
any
case
survive
a
judicial
challenge
without
chevron
this
is
a
waste
of
time
and
the
commission
should
pull
a
180
and
support
these
contracts
