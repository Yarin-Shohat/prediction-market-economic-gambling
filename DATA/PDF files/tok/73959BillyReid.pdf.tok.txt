statement
of
commissioner

regarding
proposed
rulemaking
on
event
contracts
may

2024
i
support
the
undertaking
a
rulemaking
on
event
contracts
which
is
long
overdue
during
my
tenure
on
the
commission
i
have
consistently
called
for
a
rulemaking
process
to
establish
a
framework
for
the
commission
to
exercise
the
discretionary
authority
with
respect
to
event
contracts
that
congress
granted
to
the
agency
in
our
governing
statute
the
commodity
exchange
act
unfortunately
though
i
can
not
support
this
particular
proposed
rulemaking
the
proposal
at
first
blush
it
appears
to
be
much
ado
about
as
it
seems
to
do
little
more
than
rubber
stamp
what
the
commission
has
already
said
and
done
upon
closer
inspection
though
it
is
a
wolf
in
sheep
because
where
the
proposal
departs
from
our
past
practice
it
lays
the
foundation
to
prohibit
entire
categories
of
potential
exchange
traded
event
contracts
whose
terms
and
conditions
the
commission
has
never
even
seen
in
planting
the
seeds
of
future
bans
of
countless
event
contracts
sight
unseen
the
proposal
exceeds
the
legal
authority
that
congress
granted
the
commission
in
the
cea
relies
heavily
on
a
brief
snippet
of
legislative
history
consisting
of
a
colloquy
between
two
senators
cherry
picking
parts
of
the
colloquy
it
likes
while
ignoring
other
parts
of
the
same
colloquy
resurrects
an
economic
purpose
test
for
evaluating
the
public
interest
that
was
based
on
a
provision
of
the
cea
that
was
repealed
by
congress
nearly
a
quarter
century
ago
fails
to
do
the
hard
work
of
analyzing
the
unique
nature
of
event
contracts
which
are
different
in
kind
from
traditional
derivatives
contracts
more
familiar
to
the
agency
relies
on
unsupported
conjecture
treats
similar
circumstances
differently
and
raises
more
questions
than
it
answers
and
flies
in
the
face
of
the
cftc
mandate
to
promote
responsible
innovation
as
congress
directed
in
the
cea
my
dissent
should
not
be
taken
as
an
indication
that
i
am
a
fan
of
all
event
contracts
but
it
is
hard
not
to
conclude
from
the
multitude
of
defects
in
this
proposal
that
its
significant
overreach
is
motivated
more
by
a
seemingly
visceral
antipathy
to
event
contracts
than
by
reasoned
analysis
it
does
not
matter
whether
we
think
event
contracts
are
a
good
idea
or
a
bad
idea
the
commission
must
exercise
its
authority
with
respect
to
event
contracts
within
the
scope
of
the
cftc
legal
authority
and
must
appropriately
implement
the
authority
that
congress
has
provided
us
this
proposal
fails
both
tests
1
event
contracts
in
brief
cea
section
which
was
added
to
the
cea
in
2010
by
the
dodd
frank
permits
the
commission
to
prohibit
an
event
contract
from
being
listed
for
trading
on
an
if
1
the
contract
involves
one
of
five
enumerated
activities
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
and
2
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
also
provides
that
the
commission
may
determine
by
rule
or
regulation
that
an
event
contract
involves
other
similar
activity
to
the
five
enumerated
activities
which
would
subject
event
contracts
involving
that
similar
activity
to
the
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
in
cea
section
did
not
decree
that
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
per
se
rather
if
an
event
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
may
determine
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibited
from
trading
which
necessarily
indicates
that
the
commission
also
has
the
discretion
to
determine
that
it
is
not
a
year
after
enactment
of
the
dodd
frank
act
the
commission
adopted
cftc
rule
to
implement
the
cea
new
event
contract
it
is
rule
that
the
commission
is
now
proposing
to
amend
2
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
is
significantly
overbroad
neither
the
cea
nor
the
commission
rules
define
the
term
gaming
in
the
rule
adopting
release
implementing
cea
section
the
commission
acknowledged
that
the
term
gaming
requires
further
clarification
and
said
that
the
commission
may
issue
a
future
rulemaking
concerning
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
10
i
agree
that
13
years
later
it
is
long
past
time
for
the
commission
to
do
so
but
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
is
much
too
broad
1
the
proposal
sweeps
in
the
universe
of
every
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
includes
both
the
outcome
of
a
game
and
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
a
game
so
far
so
good
but
it
then
tacks
on
an
additional
category
of
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
game
the
all
encompassing
nature
of
the
phrase
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
is
self
evident
and
that
universality
is
further
reinforced
by
its
attachment
to
the
in
connection
with
wording
the
motivation
for
this
expansive
wording
in
the
proposal
is
likely
that
where
the
phrase
in
connection
with
appears
in
various
enforcement
provisions
of
the
cea
the
commission
interprets
it
broadly
not
technically
or
restrictively
and
the
proposal
gives
no
indication
that
it
should
be
interpreted
any
differently
here
in
fact
the
proposal
at
page
29
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
event
in
connection
with
a
game
would
be
as
much
of
a
wager
or
a
bet
on
the
game
as
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
would
be
under
this
incredibly
far
reaching
formulation
there
are
countless
or
in
connection
with
a
game
that
the
proposal
would
deem
to
be
gaming
obvious
examples
include
event
contracts
involving
the
attendance
at
a
baseball
or
football
game
or
whether
a
particular
nation
will
be
selected
to
host
a
soccer
world
cup
these
would
clearly
be
in
connection
with
the
underlying
baseball
football
or
soccer
games
but
there
is
no
reason
why
staking
something
of
value
on
those
contingent
events
should
be
treated
the
same
as
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
those
games
indeed
there
is
no
better
illustration
of
the
overbreadth
of
the
in
connection
with
aspect
of
the
proposed
gaming
definition
than
the
proposal
own
example
at
page
32
of
whether
a
particular
individual
will
attend
a
game
it
is
difficult
to
fathom
why
an
event
contract
involving
whether
taylor
swift
will
attend
a
kansas
city
chiefs
football
game
should
constitute
gaming
and
impossible
to
understand
why
the
proposal
treats
similar
things
differently
since
whether
she
attends
a
beyoncé
concert
would
not
constitute
gaming
i
acknowledge
that
it
might
be
appropriate
to
extend
the
definition
of
gaming
to
include
events
that
can
affect
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
the
performance
of
a
competitor
in
a
game
event
contracts
involving
say
whether
an
injury
to
shohei
ohtani
would
prevent
him
from
playing
in
the
world
series
or
involving
the
score
of
a
football
game
at
halftime
might
be
examples
of
this
but
to
broadly
define
as
gaming
every
occurrence
or
non
occurrences
in
connection
with
a
game
regardless
of
whether
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
the
performance
of
a
competitor
in
the
game
is
wholly
unwarranted
2
elections
and
awards
are
not
gaming
the
proposal
rubber
stamps
two
prior
commission
orders
that
found
that
event
contracts
involving
political
control
or
elections
are
essentially
repeating
the
same
discussion
from
those
orders
and
then
throwing
awards
into
its
gaming
definition
as
well
yet
this
definition
is
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
cea
section
legislative
history
on
which
for
other
issues
discussed
below
the
proposal
relies
heavily
that
legislative
history
consists
of
a
colloquy
between
senators
blanche
lincoln
and
dianne
feinstein
senator
lincoln
was
then
the
chair
of
the
senate
committee
on
agriculture
nutrition
and
forestry
which
is
the
cftc
authorizing
committee
in
the
colloquy
the
senators
talked
about
gaming
only
in
the
limited
context
of
sporting
events
in
responding
to
senator
feinstein
question
about
the
cftc
authority
under
section
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
senator
lincoln
said
that
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
thus
senator
lincoln
clearly
associated
gaming
with
sporting
events
but
rather
than
remain
true
to
the
legislative
history
that
equated
gaming
with
only
sporting
events
the
proposal
broadly
sweeps
all
contests
into
its
definition
of
gaming
and
it
then
concludes
that
elections
and
awards
are
contests
and
therefore
gaming
even
though
neither
senator
lincoln
nor
senator
feinstein
ever
mentioned
elections
or
awards
or
contests
for
that
matter
the
proposal
attempts
to
squeeze
elections
and
awards
into
the
gaming
category
through
the
following
tortured
chain
of
reasoning
gaming
means
gambling
some
state
statutes
link
gambling
to
betting
or
wagering
on
contests
therefore
contests
including
elections
and
awards
constitute
gaming
yet
one
has
to
ask
if
congress
had
intended
for
elections
and
awards
to
be
enumerated
activities
is
it
more
likely
that
section
would
have
included
elections
and
awards
in
its
list
of
enumerated
activities
or
enumerated
gaming
and
hoped
the
commission
would
o
define
gaming
to
include
contests
and
o
consider
contests
to
include
elections
and
awards
congress
easily
could
have
included
elections
and
awards
as
enumerated
activities
but
it
did
not
confronted
with
this
congressional
silence
i
do
not
believe
the
commission
can
simply
decree
that
elections
and
awards
are
enumerated
activities
and
this
is
especially
the
case
when
congress
in
cea
section
provided
the
commission
with
a
ready
made
process
for
determining
through
a
rulemaking
proceeding
whether
contests
elections
awards
are
similar
to
the
enumerated
activities
including
gaming
i
am
baffled
at
why
the
commission
is
tying
itself
into
knots
by
trying
to
reason
its
way
from
gaming
to
gambling
to
contests
to
elections
and
awards
rather
than
simply
do
what
congress
said
it
could
do
consider
whether
elections
and
awards
are
similar
to
gaming
or
another
enumerated
activity
this
is
not
a
matter
of
form
over
substance
approach
matters
when
it
comes
to
exercising
our
authority
under
the
cea
and
i
can
not
support
the
proposal
approach
to
stretch
the
statutory
term
gaming
to
include
elections
and
awards
the
commission
lacks
legal
authority
to
determine
in
advance
that
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
overbreadth
of
the
proposal
gaming
definition
would
suffice
for
me
to
dissent
but
the
proposal
most
brazen
overreach
is
its
determination
in
advance
that
every
event
contract
that
involves
an
enumerated
activity
is
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
regardless
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
that
contract
the
proposal
would
prohibit
these
contracts
sight
unseen
through
the
shortcut
of
declaring
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
the
commission
lacks
legal
authority
under
the
cea
to
make
public
interest
determinations
by
category
the
proposal
justification
for
its
approach
at
page
37
is
that
the
statute
does
not
require
this
public
interest
determination
to
be
made
on
a
contract
specific
basis
this
is
backwards
the
cftc
is
a
creature
of
statute
and
has
only
the
authorities
granted
to
it
by
the
cea
there
is
no
provision
in
cea
section
for
public
interest
determinations
regarding
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
to
be
made
by
category
accordingly
the
commission
can
not
claim
that
authority
through
the
ipse
dixit
of
congress
did
say
we
could
this
is
not
a
mere
question
of
what
procedure
to
follow
the
proposal
would
allow
the
commission
to
make
the
substantive
policy
determination
that
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
regardless
of
their
terms
and
conditions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
the
consequences
of
such
a
determination
are
severe
a
complete
prohibition
on
exchanges
ability
to
list
event
contracts
and
on
market
participants
ability
to
trade
them
if
congress
had
intended
for
the
commission
to
wield
this
immense
authority
surely
it
would
have
said
so
in
fact
in
another
cea
provision
similar
to
cea
section
that
also
was
added
by
the
frank
act
congress
did
say
so
cea
section
specifically
states
that
the
commission
shall
review
each
swap
or
any
group
category
type
or
class
of
swaps
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
swap
or
group
category
type
or
class
of
swaps
should
be
required
to
be
cleared
thus
when
it
enacted
the
dodd
frank
act
congress
knew
how
to
tell
the
commission
that
it
could
make
a
determination
on
either
an
individual
or
categorical
basis
when
it
wanted
to
do
in
contrast
congress
did
not
say
in
cea
section
that
the
commission
could
make
public
interest
determinations
for
event
contracts
by
category
the
proposal
premise
is
that
a
grant
of
authority
to
make
a
determination
about
one
thing
necessarily
includes
authority
to
make
a
determination
about
a
category
of
such
things
unless
congress
says
otherwise
but
if
that
were
the
case
then
there
was
no
need
for
congress
to
tell
the
commission
in
cea
section
that
it
could
make
mandatory
swap
clearing
determinations
either
by
individual
swap
or
by
the
proposal
determination
would
render
statutory
text
in
cea
section
mere
surplusage
in
violation
of
established
canons
of
statutory
it
also
would
violate
the
canon
of
statutory
construction
that
provisions
enacted
as
part
of
the
same
statute
here
the
dodd
frank
act
should
be
construed
in
a
similar
in
the
absence
of
any
statutory
text
in
cea
section
like
that
in
cea
section
i
can
not
accept
that
congress
silently
authorized
the
cftc
to
make
life
easier
for
itself
through
the
shortcut
of
making
impactful
determinations
that
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
are
prohibited
from
trading
on
exchanges
iv
even
if
there
is
legal
authority
the
proposal
fails
to
justify
making
advance
public
interest
determinations
by
category
for
a
host
of
reasons
even
if
the
commission
has
legal
authority
to
make
public
interest
determinations
for
event
contracts
by
category
the
proposal
is
wholly
unpersuasive
in
its
attempt
to
justify
doing
so
there
are
a
multitude
of
failings
1
there
is
no
basis
to
resurrect
the
repealed
economic
purpose
test
which
should
be
applied
to
event
contracts
in
any
event
the
proposal
would
ban
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
as
being
contrary
to
the
public
interest
based
largely
on
the
proposition
that
they
fail
the
economic
purpose
test
there
are
four
significant
problems
with
this
approach
congressional
intent
first
the
proposal
relies
on
a
single
ambiguous
passage
in
the
legislative
history
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
for
purposes
of
a
public
interest
review
of
an
event
contract
to
resurrect
the
economic
purpose
test
that
the
commission
once
used
to
determine
whether
a
futures
contract
was
contrary
to
the
public
interest
until
congress
repealed
that
public
interest
requirement
in
the
proposal
resurrection
of
the
economic
purposes
test
is
based
entirely
on
this
one
passage
in
the
colloquy
between
senator
dianne
feinstein
and
senator
blanche
lincoln
feinstein
will
the
cftc
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative
as
opposed
to
hedging
or
economic
use
lincoln
that
is
our
intent
the
commission
needs
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivatives
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
supposed
event
contracts
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
these
types
of
contracts
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
used
solely
for
to
be
clear
the
dodd
frank
act
did
not
codify
the
commission
prior
economic
purpose
test
and
i
can
not
accept
the
proposal
assertion
that
this
isolated
colloquy
between
two
senators
establishes
an
intent
by
the
whole
of
congress
that
the
commission
conduct
its
public
interest
reviews
of
event
contracts
based
on
an
economic
purpose
test
that
the
commission
had
withdrawn
as
a
result
of
the
repeal
by
the
whole
of
congress
of
the
statutory
provision
it
implemented
a
decade
earlier
after
all
neither
senator
feinstein
nor
senator
lincoln
used
the
term
economic
purpose
test
or
referred
to
the
commission
guideline
no
1
that
set
out
that
test
as
someone
who
spent
over
a
decade
working
in
congress
and
who
was
present
on
the
senate
floor
for
countless
colloquies
and
even
had
a
hand
in
preparing
talking
points
for
similar
floor
discussions
i
am
confident
that
if
the
senators
believed
we
should
resurrect
the
economic
purpose
test
they
would
have
said
just
that
difference
in
kind
second
the
economic
purpose
test
was
designed
for
traditional
futures
contracts
that
have
been
listed
and
traded
on
exchanges
for
these
contracts
differ
in
kind
from
event
contracts
which
typically
are
structured
as
binary
yes
no
options
the
two
prongs
of
the
economic
purpose
test
which
the
proposal
adopts
as
a
primary
basis
for
prohibiting
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
as
being
contrary
to
the
public
interest
evaluate
1
the
contract
utility
for
price
basing
and
2
whether
the
contract
can
be
used
for
hedging
purposes
yet
the
commission
itself
has
previously
recognized
the
difference
between
event
contracts
and
the
traditional
futures
contracts
for
which
the
economic
purpose
test
was
developed
in
a
concept
release
issued
in
2008
the
commission
stated
that
iln
general
event
contracts
are
neither
dependent
on
nor
do
they
necessarily
relate
to
market
prices
or
broad
based
measures
of
economic
or
commercial
activity
and
elaborated
as
follows
since
2005
the
commission
staff
has
received
a
substantial
number
of
requests
for
guidance
on
the
propriety
of
offering
and
trading
financial
agreements
that
may
primarily
function
as
information
aggregation
vehicles
these
event
contracts
generally
take
the
form
of
financial
agreements
linked
to
eventualities
or
measures
that
neither
derive
from
nor
correlate
with
market
prices
or
broad
economic
or
commercial
in
other
words
the
proposal
would
ban
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
largely
on
the
basis
of
price
basing
and
hedging
requirements
that
event
contracts
described
in
the
concept
release
as
information
aggregation
vehicles
likely
because
of
their
very
structure
have
little
chance
of
satisfying
this
problem
is
compounded
by
the
fact
that
under
the
proposal
some
event
contracts
that
fail
to
satisfy
the
economic
purpose
test
would
be
banned
while
other
contracts
failing
the
test
would
not
for
example
the
proposal
statement
at
page
52
that
most
contracts
falling
within
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
would
have
no
underlying
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
directly
correlated
price
forming
information
is
equally
true
of
weather
related
event
contracts
but
those
contracts
would
not
be
banned
since
the
weather
is
not
an
enumerated
activity
event
contracts
involving
the
weather
can
trade
because
they
are
not
subject
to
a
public
interest
review
under
cea
section
thus
the
proposal
reliance
on
the
economic
purpose
test
means
that
exchanges
can
list
for
trading
event
contracts
such
as
those
involving
weather
that
the
commission
believes
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
which
i
find
untenable
these
are
the
inevitable
results
of
imposing
an
economic
purpose
test
on
event
contracts
that
was
not
designed
for
event
contracts
certainly
a
rulemaking
proceeding
could
be
appropriate
to
fully
explore
the
economic
attributes
of
event
contracts
and
to
consider
how
to
incorporate
such
attributes
into
a
public
interest
review
that
is
tailored
to
the
nature
of
event
contracts
but
that
is
not
this
proposal
government
paternalism
third
the
proposal
asserts
at
page
50
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
others
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
generally
is
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
price
of
commodities
or
other
financial
assets
or
instruments
limiting
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
an
event
contract
involving
such
an
occurrence
but
to
say
that
there
are
limits
to
the
hedging
utility
of
an
event
contract
is
simply
a
statement
that
the
contract
may
not
be
a
particularly
good
hedging
vehicle
market
participants
should
be
permitted
to
make
their
own
choices
about
what
financial
products
meet
their
hedging
needs
it
is
not
the
cftc
role
to
deny
them
that
choice
altogether
because
we
feel
a
given
product
hedging
value
is
limited
the
economic
purpose
test
was
not
applied
to
categories
of
contracts
fourth
even
assuming
that
the
economic
purpose
test
is
an
appropriate
part
of
a
public
interest
analysis
for
event
contracts
it
does
not
support
making
public
interest
determinations
for
event
contracts
by
category
because
the
commission
applied
its
economic
purpose
test
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
individual
contracts
the
commission
guideline
no
1
provided
that
contract
terms
and
conditions
must
be
justified
in
order
for
an
exchange
to
demonstrate
that
it
met
the
economic
purpose
test
24
the
commission
took
no
shortcuts
in
applying
its
subsequently
withdrawn
economic
purpose
test
to
futures
contracts
it
did
not
group
contracts
into
categories
such
as
all
futures
contracts
on
wheat
corn
gold
or
silver
in
evaluating
the
public
interest
through
its
economic
purpose
test
rather
the
commission
looked
at
each
contract
individual
contract
terms
and
conditions
to
make
that
determination
if
the
proposal
is
going
to
incorrectly
adopt
that
economic
purpose
test
in
determining
whether
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
then
it
should
apply
that
test
the
same
way
2
the
proposal
application
of
other
factors
falls
far
short
of
justifying
its
prohibition
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
aside
from
the
economic
purpose
test
the
proposal
points
to
a
hodgepodge
of
other
factors
to
try
to
justify
prohibiting
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
whose
terms
and
conditions
the
commission
has
never
seen
from
being
traded
on
exchanges
but
its
discussion
of
these
factors
is
conjectural
and
without
evidentiary
support
calls
into
question
other
contracts
that
are
trading
on
regulated
exchanges
and
raises
more
questions
than
it
answers
taken
as
a
whole
the
proposal
falls
far
short
of
justifying
the
shortcut
of
prohibiting
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
even
assuming
the
commission
has
the
legal
authority
to
do
so
examples
of
these
defects
in
the
proposal
abound
but
i
will
focus
here
on
just
a
few
hopelessly
impractical
the
category
of
activities
illegal
under
state
law
demonstrates
the
type
of
problems
inherent
in
determining
that
all
event
contracts
in
a
category
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
some
activities
are
illegal
in
some
states
but
not
others
yet
the
proposal
does
not
provide
any
guidance
on
several
obvious
questions
is
an
event
contract
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
involves
an
activity
that
is
illegal
in
only
a
single
state
and
if
so
why
or
if
not
then
how
many
states
have
to
declare
an
activity
illegal
before
the
automatic
prohibition
on
event
contracts
involving
that
activity
is
triggered
more
than
half
states
comprising
a
certain
percentage
of
the
country
the
problem
is
exacerbated
by
the
proposal
suggestion
that
the
prohibition
of
event
contracts
canhinge
on
decisions
by
judges
is
this
reference
limited
to
supreme
courts
of
the
states
or
would
a
ruling
by
a
lower
court
of
a
state
that
a
particular
activity
is
illegal
trigger
an
automatic
determination
that
an
event
contract
involving
that
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
what
if
that
decision
is
appealed
while
i
have
focused
here
on
the
category
of
event
contracts
involving
activities
illegal
under
state
law
these
types
of
practical
questions
are
a
foreseeable
and
inevitable
result
of
any
determination
that
an
entire
category
of
event
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
i
recognize
that
a
contract
specific
approach
to
making
public
interest
determinations
regarding
event
contracts
may
be
difficult
and
resource
intensive
for
the
cftc
but
aside
from
my
view
that
a
contract
specific
approach
is
required
by
the
cea
it
also
is
a
better
approach
from
a
policy
perspective
precisely
because
it
would
permit
the
cftc
to
consider
these
practical
questions
in
the
context
of
the
specific
circumstances
applicable
to
a
particular
event
contract
we
do
not
get
to
override
a
requirement
under
the
law
because
it
will
be
hard
or
require
more
work
for
us
absolutism
based
on
conjecture
another
defect
in
the
proposal
is
illustrated
by
the
following
at
page
50
generally
speaking
the
commission
believes
that
something
of
value
is
staked
or
risked
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
others
or
a
game
or
sic
skill
or
chance
for
entertainment
purposes
in
order
wager
sic
on
the
occurrence
as
such
the
commission
believes
that
contracts
involving
such
occurrences
are
likely
to
be
traded
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
emphasis
added
footnote
omitted
or
hedging
interest
these
assertions
are
entirely
conjectural
as
the
proposal
does
not
cite
any
support
for
these
statements
one
can
readily
envision
an
event
contract
involving
whether
a
particular
us
city
will
be
awarded
the
summer
or
winter
olympic
games
in
a
given
year
which
would
be
used
by
hotel
and
restaurant
owners
as
well
as
other
businesses
that
would
make
money
if
their
city
gets
the
olympics
but
not
if
the
olympics
are
awarded
elsewhere
such
an
event
contract
would
not
necessarily
be
used
predominantly
for
entertainment
or
speculative
purposes
indeed
the
quoted
text
itself
uses
wording
like
glenerally
speaking
and
likely
which
is
an
acknowledgement
that
its
conclusions
are
not
universally
true
a
belief
for
which
no
evidence
is
cited
and
that
is
acknowledged
not
to
be
true
across
the
board
can
not
justify
an
absolutist
determination
that
all
event
contracts
involving
an
activity
are
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nor
can
it
justify
a
prohibition
on
trading
all
event
contracts
in
that
category
calling
into
question
traditional
futures
contracts
i
agree
that
an
event
contract
involving
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
event
and
that
allows
players
or
coaches
to
trade
that
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
consistent
with
its
overreach
the
proposal
also
concludes
that
even
where
the
terms
and
conditions
of
such
a
contract
prohibit
such
persons
from
trading
the
contract
is
nonetheless
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
proposal
stated
rationale
at
page
51
is
that
the
athlete
or
coach
would
potentially
have
a
platform
for
example
access
to
media
combined
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regarding
the
team
that
could
be
used
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
the
same
can
be
said
of
many
traditional
exchange
traded
futures
contracts
for
example
oil
companies
or
companies
in
the
agricultural
or
metals
sectors
or
other
energy
companies
also
have
access
to
media
combined
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regarding
the
oil
or
other
industry
that
could
be
used
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
and
yet
exchanges
are
permitted
to
list
oil
futures
for
trading
in
fact
oil
companies
are
permitted
to
trade
them
the
proposal
offers
no
explanation
for
why
a
possible
incentive
to
spread
misinformation
should
render
all
event
contracts
involving
sporting
events
or
occurrences
or
non
occurrences
in
connection
with
sporting
events
contrary
to
the
public
interest
when
traditional
futures
contracts
with
the
same
incentive
are
not
a
contract
specific
public
interest
analysis
by
contrast
could
take
into
account
the
terms
and
conditions
of
a
particular
event
contract
such
as
whether
athletes
and
coaches
can
trade
or
whether
there
are
guardrails
against
the
spread
of
misinformation
to
determine
whether
the
threat
of
misinformation
in
that
contract
is
such
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
fallacies
concerning
the
cftc
regulatory
and
enforcement
roles
the
proposal
raises
in
alarmist
tones
the
red
herring
that
sweeping
public
interest
determinations
are
necessary
so
that
the
cftc
does
not
get
drawn
into
a
regulatory
or
enforcement
role
for
which
it
is
not
well
equipped
for
example
the
proposal
says
at
page
44
that
one
factor
that
may
be
relevant
in
evaluating
whether
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
the
extent
to
which
they
would
draw
the
commission
into
areas
outside
of
its
primary
regulatory
remit
other
examples
are
1
the
statements
at
page
55
relating
to
event
contracts
involving
elections
that
the
commission
is
not
tasked
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
laws
and
2
the
statement
in
the
first
sentence
of
footnote
no
127
that
the
oversight
function
in
this
area
regarding
elections
is
best
reserved
for
other
expert
bodies
to
be
clear
the
cftc
does
not
administer
oversee
or
regulate
elections
sporting
events
gambling
or
any
other
activity
or
event
discussed
in
the
proposal
and
that
will
not
change
with
respect
to
any
event
contract
that
is
found
not
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
the
cftc
would
exercise
its
exact
same
authorities
under
the
cea
that
it
does
with
respect
to
all
other
derivatives
contracts
nor
would
the
cftc
become
some
type
of
election
cop
after
all
the
cftc
has
anti
fraud
and
manipulation
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
futures
contracts
on
broad
based
security
indices
but
that
does
not
mean
the
cftc
regulates
the
securities
markets
or
that
it
is
tasked
with
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
the
securities
markets
or
enforcement
of
securities
laws
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
sec
does
all
that
the
cftc
similarly
has
enforcement
authority
with
respect
to
natural
gas
and
electricity
since
there
are
futures
contracts
on
those
commodities
but
that
does
not
mean
the
cftc
regulates
the
transmission
of
natural
gas
or
electricity
or
that
it
is
tasked
with
the
protection
of
the
integrity
of
physical
natural
gas
or
power
markets
or
enforcement
of
the
natural
gas
act
or
the
federal
power
act
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
ferc
does
all
that
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
an
event
contract
that
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
is
permitted
to
trade
on
a
regulated
exchange
as
the
supreme
court
has
stated
this
court
cases
have
consistently
held
that
the
use
of
the
words
public
interest
in
a
regulatory
statute
is
not
a
broad
license
to
promote
the
general
public
welfare
rather
the
words
take
meaning
from
the
purposes
of
the
regulatory
legislation
27
if
a
particular
event
contract
involving
elections
were
found
not
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
permitted
to
trade
the
cftc
would
have
absolutely
no
authority
to
administer
oversee
or
regulate
the
elections
that
are
the
subject
of
that
contract
or
to
enforce
any
campaign
finance
laws
its
authority
would
extend
only
so
far
as
is
the
case
with
respect
to
all
commodities
underlying
derivatives
contracts
within
our
jurisdiction
as
provided
by
congress
in
the
cea
why
this
is
important
i
can
understand
why
some
might
ask
you
have
been
pleading
for
an
event
contracts
rulemaking
for
some
time
now
and
here
it
is
so
what
is
the
problem
the
problem
is
this
cftc
rule
already
prohibits
the
listing
and
trading
of
any
event
contract
involving
an
enumerated
activity
as
i
explained
in
my
kalshi
dissenting
statement
rule
contradicts
the
statute
cea
section
grants
the
commission
discretion
to
determine
whether
an
exchange
event
contract
that
involves
an
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cftc
rule
a
by
contrast
provides
that
an
exchange
shall
not
list
for
an
enumerated
activity
emphasis
added
read
literally
rule
trading
a
contract
that
involves
a
removes
entirely
the
flexibility
that
congress
granted
the
commission
to
evaluate
exchange
event
contracts
from
a
public
interest
perspective
28
rather
than
fix
this
problem
though
the
proposal
doubles
down
on
it
by
making
categorical
public
interest
determinations
in
advance
the
proposal
would
impermissibly
transform
the
two
step
analysis
that
congress
provided
for
event
contracts
into
a
single
step
it
would
transmogrify
the
discretion
that
congress
gave
the
commission
to
determine
that
an
event
contract
involving
an
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
into
a
mandate
that
it
do
so
the
proposal
actually
is
quite
candid
in
acknowledging
that
it
would
re
write
cea
section
c
it
states
at
page
38
if
as
proposed
rule
is
amended
to
include
a
categorical
public
interest
determination
with
respect
to
contracts
involving
each
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
commission
would
not
going
forward
undertake
a
contract
specific
public
interest
analysis
as
part
of
a
review
rather
the
focus
of
any
such
review
would
be
to
evaluate
whether
the
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
in
which
case
it
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
if
congress
had
intended
that
every
event
contract
involving
an
enumerated
activity
is
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibited
from
trading
it
could
have
provided
for
such
a
step
process
in
cea
section
but
it
did
not
do
that
and
instead
provided
that
even
if
an
event
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
can
not
prohibit
the
contract
without
exercising
its
discretion
in
a
second
step
of
determining
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
ca
short
circuit
the
process
that
congress
established
by
determining
that
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
advance
and
without
knowing
the
contract
terms
and
conditions
simply
because
that
makes
things
easier
for
the
agency
granted
the
proposal
makes
categorical
public
interest
determinations
only
for
the
activities
enumerated
in
cea
section
i
admit
that
i
am
not
going
to
lose
sleep
over
a
determination
that
all
event
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination
and
war
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
this
is
where
the
wolf
in
sheep
clothing
arrives
while
this
proposal
only
addresses
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
it
sets
the
precedent
for
how
the
commission
can
handle
event
contracts
involving
other
activities
that
it
determines
are
similar
to
enumerated
activities
too
if
the
proposal
is
adopted
as
final
then
at
any
time
in
the
future
the
commission
could
determine
that
other
activities
are
similar
to
enumerated
activities
and
could
then
determine
that
every
event
contract
involving
that
activity
is
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
prohibited
from
trading
regardless
of
its
particular
terms
and
conditions
and
given
all
the
deficiencies
in
this
proposal
categorical
public
interest
determinations
discussed
above
that
appears
to
be
a
low
bar
to
clear
portions
of
the
proposal
are
inaccurate
or
extremely
weak
or
make
no
sense
the
fact
that
certain
portions
of
the
proposal
are
inaccurate
extremely
weak
or
simply
make
no
sense
suggests
that
it
either
was
hastily
prepared
or
is
motivated
primarily
by
the
sheer
hatred
that
the
commission
seems
to
bear
towards
event
contracts
here
are
a
few
examples
proposal
says
at
page
44
that
the
public
good
is
a
relevant
factor
for
consideration
in
an
evaluation
of
whether
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
makes
no
sense
that
the
commission
should
consider
the
public
good
in
evaluating
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
is
tautological
the
public
good
and
the
public
interest
mean
the
same
thing
the
proposal
statement
at
pages
39
40
that
in
the
colloquy
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
discussed
the
commission
authority
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
cfma
to
prevent
trading
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
incorrect
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
did
not
discuss
the
commission
pre
cfma
authority
senator
feinstein
referenced
it
in
asking
a
question
but
senator
lincoln
the
committee
chair
did
not
talk
about
it
in
fact
she
did
not
even
mention
the
cfma
no
49
cites
the
cftc
reauthorization
act
of

as
support
for
the
proposal
view
that
an
erroneous
reference
to
a
non
existent
cea
section
in
cea
section
was
intended
by
congress
to
refer
to
cea
section
instead
since
the
bill
included
a
provision
to
replace
the
reference
to
section
with
a
reference
to
section
but
an
amendment
in
a
bill
introduced
in
a
subsequent
congress
nine
years
later
sheds
no
light
on
what
was
intended
by
the
congress
that
enacted
the
statutory
provision
in
question
especially
when
the
referenced
bill
was
not
enacted
and
nothing
has
happened
on
it
during
the
ensuing
five
years
vi
certain
implementation
timeline
provisions
in
the
proposal
are
ill
advised
implementation
timeline
as
discussed
above
i
do
not
support
the
proposal
to
determine
that
all
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
if
the
commission
decides
to
do
so
i
oppose
applying
that
determination
to
contracts
that
are
already
listed
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
final
rule
amendments
in
the
federal
register
it
is
my
hope
that
there
would
be
few
such
contracts
but
for
any
contracts
that
would
be
impacted
the
proposal
is
pollyanaish
in
its
rosy
view
that
a
60
day
implementation
period
for
these
contracts
will
minimize
any
market
disruption
that
might
be
caused
by
the
rule
amendments
for
one
thing
given
the
proposal
repeated
emphasis
at
pages
29
33
and
54
that
its
examples
of
activities
that
constitute
gaming
under
the
proposed
definition
are
non
exclusive
i
am
dubious
that
exchanges
and
traders
necessarily
will
know
exactly
which
existing
event
contracts
the
commission
believes
are
now
suddenly
prohibited
beyond
that
this
aspect
of
the
proposal
is
fundamentally
unfair
at
any
time
during
the
13
years
since
its
adoption
of
rule
the
commission
could
have
concluded
that
a
given
event
contractnvolving
an
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
exchanges
and
market
participants
that
have
listed
and
traded
an
event
contract
in
good
faith
reliance
on
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
not
determined
the
contract
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
not
pay
the
price
literally
for
the
commission
inaction
by
having
to
halt
trading
in
a
fixed
amount
of
time
because
the
commission
has
finally
gotten
around
to
it
this
would
be
the
antithesis
of
good
government
accordingly
i
do
not
believe
that
any
rule
amendments
finalized
as
part
of
this
rulemaking
should
apply
to
an
event
contract
that
is
listed
and
available
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
their
publication
in
the
federal
register
vii
conclusion
rather
than
undertake
a
rulemaking
process
to
do
the
hard
work
of
building
a
framework
for
evaluating
event
contracts
pursuant
to
cea
section
the
commission
squandered
the
14
years
since
that
provision
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
dodd
frank
act
while
the
commission
is
now
proposing
an
event
contract
rulemaking
that
hard
work
still
has
yet
to
be
done
instead
the
commission
is
skipping
right
over
building
a
proper
framework
and
simply
proposing
to
prohibit
contracts
outright
this
result
seems
preordained
given
the
hostility
that
the
commission
has
displayed
toward
event
contracts
since
the
enactment
of
the
dodd
frank
act
this
proposal
rubber
stamps
the
commission
two
prior
orders
finding
proposed
event
contracts
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
addition
it
continues
the
tradition
of
stretching
a
solitary
cryptic
colloquy
to
form
the
basis
for
evaluating
whether
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
through
the
economic
purpose
test
that
1
is
not
mentioned
in
the
statute
2
had
previously
been
withdrawn
due
to
congress
repeal
of
the
cea
provision
it
implemented
3
was
not
designed
for
this
type
of
contract
and
4
many
event
contracts
due
to
their
structure
likely
will
be
unable
to
meet
and
now
the
proposal
goes
even
further
adopting
an
overly
broad
definition
of
gaming
and
declaring
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
sight
unseen
the
commission
legal
authority
to
make
such
determinations
by
category
is
questionable
at
best
that
it
is
inappropriate
from
a
policy
perspective
can
not
reasonably
be
questioned
the
proposal
flatly
contravenes
congress
direction
in
the
cea
that
the
cftc
promote
responsible
innovation
29
the
unmistakable
take
away
for
exchanges
is
not
to
expend
resources
developing
an
innovative
event
contract
because
the
commission
will
go
to
great
lengths
to
find
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibit
it
from
trading
30
i
want
to
be
very
clear
my
dissent
should
not
be
taken
as
an
endorsement
of
the
wisdom
of
event
contracts
generally
or
of
any
event
contract
in
particular
rather
it
reflects
my
application
of
congress
direction
to
the
commission
in
cea
section
whatever
we
may
think
of
event
contracts
we
can
not
re
write
the
cea
to
claim
an
authority
that
congress
did
not
give
us
because
we
have
been
derelict
in
applying
the
authority
that
congress
did
give
us
nor
should
we
be
prohibiting
an
event
contract
without
a
proper
showing
that
it
involves
an
enumerated
activity
and
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
based
on
the
application
of
well
defined
factors
to
the
particular
terms
and
conditions
of
that
particular
contract

the

justifies
its

approach
regarding
activity
that
is

at

on
the
grounds
that
it
eliminates
the
possibility
that
the
commission
would
have
to
serve
as
arbiter
of
a
state
own
public
interest
determination
in
recognizing
specific
activity
as
causing
or
posing
public
harm
but
unless
the
activity
is
illegal
in
all
50
states
then
in
determining
that
an
event
contract
involving
an
activity
illegal
in
some
states
is
automatically
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
is
inherently
as
arbiter
of
the
determination
by
all
the
other
states
that
the
activity
does
not
cause
or
pose
public
harm

since
the
cftc
has

is
