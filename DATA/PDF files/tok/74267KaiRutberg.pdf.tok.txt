proposal

to
recognize
the
significant
role
these

play
in
price
discovery

information
aggregation

are
essential
functions
for
efficient
markets
and
informed
decision
making

various
sectors

price

price
discovery
is
a
fundamental
process
by
which
market
participants
determine
the
fair
value
of
an
asset
or
event
outcome
through
their
collective
actions
election
event
contracts
serve
as
a
vital
mechanism
for
price
basing
in
the
political
and
policy
spheres
offering
numerous
benefits
that
should
not
be
overlooked
1
enhanced
information
aggregation
election
markets
aggregate
diverse
information
from
a
wide
range
of
participants
including
political
analysts
economists

citizens
this
collective
wisdom
often
produces
more
accurate
forecasts
than
traditional
polling
methods
or
individual
expert
opinions

banning
these
markets
the
cftc
would
be
eliminating
a
valuable
source
of

helps
businesses
policymakers

the
public
make
more
informed
decisions

i
strongly
urge

a
regulatory
framework
that
preserves
the
important
price
basing
functions
of
election
markets
while
addressing
any
legitimate
concerns
about
market
integrity
the
cftc
should
recognize
that
