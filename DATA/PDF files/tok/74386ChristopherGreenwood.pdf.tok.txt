dear
chairman
and
commissioners
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
i
am
writing
in
support
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
approving
kalshi
proposal
for
electoral
prediction
markets
my
name
is
jason
furman
and
i
am
jointly
the
aetna
professor
of
the
practice
of
economic
policy
harvard
kennedy
school
and
a
professor
the
practice
of
economic
policy
in
the
economics
department
at
harvard
university
where
i
conduct
a
wide
range
of
research
on
policy
related
issues
i
served
as
chairman
of
the
council
of
economic
advisers
under
president
obama
from
2013
to
2017
serving
as
his
chief
economist
and
a
member
of
his
cabinet
prior
to
that
i
served
as
deputy
director
of
the
national
economic
council
from
2009
to
2013
in
those
capacities
i
was
deeply
involved
in
the
administration
response
to
the
great
recession
and
at
the
forefront
of
some
of
the
largest
economic
and
policy
debates
of
the
time
including
the
american
recovery
and
reinvestment
act
the
affordable
care
act
and
the
debates
over
the
debt
limit
and
fiscal
cliff
in
2011
and
2012
my
own
use
of
prediction
markets
including
electoral
prediction
markets
i
have
personally
encountered
and
extensively
used
prediction
markets
including
electoral
prediction
markets
extensively
in
three
different
settings
the
first
is
in
the
white
house
i
along
with
other
members
of
the
economic
team
would
regularly
refer
to
prediction
markets
on
electoral
outcomes
and
specific
events
to
help
inform
our
understanding
of
how
political
and
economic
developments
would
affect
economic
policymaking
in
understanding
the
risks
of
a
government
shutdown
or
debt
limit
showdown
for
example
it
would
be
helpful
to
understand
what
informed
traders
with
money
at
stake
would
expect
a
method
of
understanding
probabilities
that
research
has
consistently
shown
is
superior
to
other
ways
of
summarizing
and
updating
based
on
information
the
second
is
in
economic
research
while
i
have
not
done
any
research
on
prediction
markets
i
have
frequently
read
and
referred
to
this
research
to
understand
not
just
elections
but
the
way
that
elections
affect
financial
markets
and
the
economy
more
broadly
in
fact
some
research
on
financial
markets
and
the
economy
would
be
impossible
without
these
prediction
markets
the
third
is
in
teaching
i
co
teach
harvard
introductory
economics
class
called
ec10
and
we
introduce
our
students
to
prediction
markets
show
that
on
average
they
have
historically
been
very
accurate
and
then
show
them
political
prediction
markets
i
believe
that
understanding
probability
the
difference
between
people
actions
when
money
is
at
stake
and
when
it
just
cheap
talk
and
the
role
of
markets
in
aggregating
information
is
helpful
to
students
generally
and
specifically
in
the
case
of
electoral
prediction
markets
the
reason
why
political
prediction
markets
are
superior
to
other
tools
for
all
of
the
above
purposes
is
that
they
incorporate
a
wide
range
of
information
quickly
and
efficiently
a
statistical
model
such
as
fivethirtyeight
can
only
reflect
the
impact
of
an
event
on
the
political
race
once
it
starts
appearing
in
polls
in
contrast
a
prediction
market
can
react
immediately
this
near
realtime
probability
calibration
can
be
highly
useful
for
researchers
whose
event
studies
rely
on
a
quick
turnaround
between
the
event
occurring
and
the
change
in
the
data
in
order
to
isolate
the
effects
of
the
event
from
anything
else
occurring
in
that
period
for
instance
a
researcher
trying
to
learn
the
effects
of
a
supreme
court
decision
an
economic
data
release
or
a
candidate
debate
on
electoral
outcomes
can
not
wait
weeks
for
enough
polls
to
arrive
to
form
a
competent
polling
average
as
too
many
different
events
may
have
occurred
in
the
interregnum
to
be
able
to
draw
conclusions
about
any
one
in
particular
prediction
markets
as
a
price
discovery
tool
the
benefits
of
electoral
prediction
markets
go
well
beyond
the
ways
in
which
i
have
used
them
in
my
career
elections
can
have
profound
affects
for
businesses
it
is
important
for
businesses
to
be
able
to
make
better
predictions
about
elections
discussed
in
this
section
and
also
hedge
against
the
consequences
of
them
discussed
in
the
next
section
specifically
election
prediction
market
can
facilitate
more
accurate
price
discovery
in
other
markets
even
those
who
are
not
actively
participating
in
the
market
for
election
contracts
then
can
benefit
from
the
data
that
it
provides
for
instance
suppose
an
energy
firm
is
attempting
to
assess
a
fair
market
value
for
fuel
to
be
delivered
two
years
hence
to
do
so
the
energy
firm
must
estimate
how
supply
and
demand
are
likely
to
evolve
over
that
period
perhaps
they
use
meteorological
data
and
expect
the
winter
to
be
unusually
cold
and
thus
demand
might
rise
or
they
survey
earnings
calls
from
key
manufacturers
to
anticipate
that
supply
chain
bottlenecks
from
overseas
natural
gas
producers
might
ease
up
lowering
the
price
but
another
key
factor
they
will
consider
is
political
risk
legislative
changes
in
environmental
policy
might
increase
or
decrease
the
cost
of
producing
natural
gas
while
there
is
plenty
of
satellite
data
for
a
trader
to
use
to
estimate
the
weather
impact
on
demand
there
is
little
hard
data
to
use
to
estimate
political
risk
which
is
a
large
part
of
the
pricing
puzzle
enter
election
prediction
markets
traders
know
that
their
risk
of
beneficial
or
adverse
policy
changes
depend
on
which
party
is
in
power
and
that
change
in
risk
is
exactly
what
is
necessary
to
price
those
commodity
futures
more
accurately
a
liquid
well
regulated
prediction
market
offering
an
accurate
probability
estimate
of
who
is
likely
to
control
congress
would
thus
be
highly
valuable
to
price
discovery
there
is
ample
academic
evidence
to
suggest
that
prediction
markets
are
highly
efficient
at
aggregating
information
to
produce
an
accurate
forecast
when
compared
to
alternatives
especially
farther
out
from
an
election
for
example
economists
erik
snowberg
justin
wolfers
and
eric
zitzewitz
used
data
from
the
iowa
electronic
markets
to
find
clear
linkages
between
prediction
market
prices
and
equity
valuations

benefits
of
electoral
prediction
markets
for
small
businesses
needing
to
hedge
election
markets
can
also
allow
businesses
and
others
to
participate
directly
and
hedge
against
the
consequences
of
elections
absent
prediction
markets
businesses
have
no
simple
and
transparent
way
to
hedge
against
these
risks
millions
of
businesses
are
affected
by
changes
in
congressional
control
facing
both
positive
and
negative
risks
congressional
control
impacts
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
ways
that
have
direct
economic
consequence
to
businesses
and
workers
this
risk
is
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
similar
risks
that
can
and
should
be
managed
using
the
financial
markets
many
businesses
have
a
regulated
component
to
them
either
directly
because
the
business
is
a
regulated
activity
or
as
an
integral
component
to
the
business
energy
healthcare
and
education
are
some
of
the
many
industries
that
are
directly
affected
by
the
federal
government
even
industries
that
are
not
directly
regulated
operate
in
an
environment
that
is
directly
impacted
by
the
federal
government
whether
it
is
due
to
tax
policy
labor
regulations
financial
regulations
or
other
myriad
policies
the
government
sets
political
control
can
also
impact
the
overall
business
environment
including
macroeconomic
developments
like
the
likelihood
of
legislation
that
will
raise
or
lower
overall
economic
activity
and
thus
business
sales
and
also
specific
changes
that
could
affect
a
businesses
ability
to
raise
capital
hire
workers
and
expand
businesses
should
recalibrate
and
manage
risk
before
elections
occur
businesses
are
forward
looking
and
should
anticipate
changes
in
policy
and
government
attitudes
for
example
businesses
hire
contract
and
build
in
anticipation
of
future
demand
investment
decisions
partnerships
acquisitions
and
more
are
made
in
anticipation
of
future
growth
and
performance
partnerships
loans
and
equity
deals
are
similarly
forward
looking
and
similarly
are
affected
by
political
control
accordingly
risk
management
must
begin
beforehand
as
well
equities
and
commodity
futures
reprice
to
account
for
potential
changes
in
political
control
election
markets
also
provide
an
efficient
tool
for
managing
these
dynamic
and
interrelated
risks
a
person
that
faces
risks
from
multiple
legislative
changes
and
the
changes
to
the
business
environment
that
come
with
political
control
can
effectively
manage
the
risk
through
this
contract
but
can
not
easily
do
so
using
contracts
for
individual
policies
alone
it
is
this
hedging
utility
that
distinguishes
the
market
from
the
gaming
contracts
that
the
cftc
may
be
worried
about
whereas
gaming
contracts
such
as
a
contract
on
the
number
of
touchdowns
a
player
scores
in
a
football
game
can
not
reasonably
be
used
for
risk
reduction
purposes
an
event
contract
on
congressional
control
clearly
relates
to
an
event
of
great
economic
importance
the
fact
that
many
participants
are
not
themselves
using
the
contract
for
hedging
does
not
refute
this
argument
if
anything
non
hedgers
serve
a
valuable
purpose
by
providing
greater
liquidity
and
superior
price
discovery
for
the
hedgers
themselves
just
as
they
do
in
a
wide
range
of
financial
markets
only
if
a
market
is
exclusively
used
by
speculators
because
the
underlying
event
does
not
create
sufficient
risk
that
can
be
hedged
would
a
contract
be
gaming
in
contrast
not
only
can
these
markets
be
used
for
hedging
the
great
economic
importance
of
the
underlying
event
and
the
significance
of
the
risk
make
them
highly
likely
to
be
used
as
such
the
benefits
of
approving
electoral
prediction
markets
overwhelmingly
outweigh
the
costs
elections
are
not
games
and
the
outcome
of
political
control
of
congress
has
enormous
public
interest
ramifications
election
focused
prediction
markets
combine
the
economic
significance
of
a
powerful
risk
reduction
tool
for
small
businesses
with
the
social
significance
of
a
powerful
forecasting
tool
for
researchers
and
policy
makers
a
regulated
election
market
will
further
the
public
interest
by
providing
a
valuable
risk
management
tool
and
providing
data
that
will
be
valuable
to
businesses
economic
researchers
and
policymakers
alike
this
is
the
exact
kind
of
innovation
that
the
cftc
should
be
embracing
i
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
contract
for
electoral
markets
