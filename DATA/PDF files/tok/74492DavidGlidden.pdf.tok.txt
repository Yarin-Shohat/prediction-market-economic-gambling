i
write
to
express
my
disagreement
with
the
commission
proposed
amendments
to
its
rules
concerning
event
contracts
17
cfr
part

event
contracts
summary
i
appreciate
the
commission
desire
to
provide
clarity
in
the
area
of
event
contracts
to
reduce
burden
and
wasted
effort
by
registered
entities
new
applicants
and
the
commission
staff
however
i
believe
that
the
commission
has
incorrectly
evaluated
the
public
interest
consideration
of
these
contracts
contracts
involving
political
events
are
very
much
in
the
public
interest
serving
to
strengthen
not
weaken
our
democratic
electoral
process
the
volatile
political
events
of
this
summer
2024
occurring
after
the
amendments
were
proposed
highlight
the
demand
and
need
for
fast
access
to
the
wisdom
of
the
crowds
provided
by
these
event
contracts
the
commission
should
be
wary
of
the
unintended
consequences
of
limiting
these
contracts
to
platforms
where
americans
can
not
participate
and
where
the
commission
can
not
regulate
them
finally
i
ask
the
commission
to
reconsider
and
identify
alternative
solutions
to
its
concerns
with
regards
to
how
to
structure
political
event
contracts
to
avoid
putting
the
commission
in
the
position
of
an
elections
cop
and
how
activity
unlawful
under
state
law
relates
to
event
contracts
outline
of
arguments

if

on

it
should
strongly

of
unregulated
offshore
event
contract
platforms
accessible
only
to

4
the
commission
interpretation
about
political
event
contracts
involves
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
is
misguided
upon
closer
reading
of
the
authority
given
to
the
commission
arguments
the
commission
asks
are
there
factors
in
addition
to
those
described
herein
that
may
be
relevant
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public

contracts
involving

are
very
much
in
the
public
interest
the
political
events
of
summer
2024
have
shown
the
importance
and
demand
of
the
wisdom
generated
by
such
event
contracts
commenters
in
favor
of
political
event
contracts
have
spoken
at
length
to
their
value
in
previous
comment
periods
relating
to
nadex
and
more
recently
kalshi
i
submit
my
personal
support
in
favor
of
these
contracts
while
i
personally
do
not
trade
in
significant
volume
on
platforms
like
predictit
or
kalshi
i
am
a
frequent
consumer
of
the
wisdom
they
provide
those
platforms
along
with
play
money
prediction
markets
like
manifold
are
the
primary
ways
i
get
my
news
especially
political
news
they
allow
me
to
be
a
more
informed
citizen
due
to
their
wisdom
of
the
crowds
approach
of
aggregating
all
other
news
sources
into
quantitative
probabilities
these
markets
are
the
most
effective
method
we
have
of
deriving
intelligence
price
discovery
of
political
outcomes
that
financially
rewards
those
who
are
free
of
opinion
and
bias
for
anything
but
the
truth
in
footnote
125
of
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
the
commission
rightly
states
that
certain
commenters
on
the
contracts
subject
to
the
kalshi
order
asserted
that
event
contracts
involving
occurrences
in
connection
with
political
election
contests
could
serve
as
a
check
on
misinformation
and
inaccurate
polling
stating
that
market
based
alternatives
tend
to
be
more
accurate
than
polling
or
other
methods
of
predicting
election
outcomes
i
agree
with
those
commenters
the
commission
goes
on
to
express
the
concern
that
a
seemingly
false
or
unreliable
poll
can
cause
significant
movement
on
an
event
contract
market
and
suggests
that
such
poll
could
have
been
or
at
least
could
be
created
to
cause
such
market
movement
further
arguing
that
such
false
polls
can
have
a
real
and
detrimental
effect
on
elections
citing
an
article
by
former
fivethirtyeight
journalist
harry
enten
since
writing
that
article
enten
has
publicly
commented
on
the
usefulness
of
political
event
markets
to
understand
the
conventional
wisdom
and
regularly
references
such
markets
in
his
current
position
as
a
senior
data
reporter
at
cnn
this
suggests
that
the
fear
of
fake
polling
having
a
significant
negative
impact
on
the
value
of
prediction
markets
is
overblown
relative
to
the
value
these
markets
provide
in
my
anecdotal
experience
in
the
political
forecasting
twittersphere
misinformation
and
inaccurate
polls
are
noticed
and
publicized
as
a
result
of
the
overall
trading
community
having
a
financial
incentive
to
identify
and
flag
them
all
this
said
these
arguments
in
favor
of
political
event
contracts
do
not
yet
seem
to
have
been
persuasive
to
the
commission
as
suggested
by
these
latest
proposed
amendments
to
categorize
political
event
contracts
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
therefore
i
implore
the
commission
to
reconsider
its
position
given
the
volatile
political
events
of
summer
2024
following
the
commission
notice
of
this
proposed
rulemaking
this
summer
which
has
seen
unprecedented
political
uncertainty
following
the
presidential
debate
between
president
biden
and
former
president
trump
an
attempted
assassination
of
former
president
trump
president
biden
subsequent
withdrawal
from
the
race
vice
president
harris
quick
rise
to
nomination
and
two
major
party
vice
presidential
candidate
selections
has
shown
the
importance
and
demand
of
the
wisdom
generated
by
prediction
market
platforms
offering
political
event
contracts
or
the
like
polymarket
alone
has
hit
record
high
trading
volume
in
both
june
m
and
july
m
up
to
over
600
of
its
previous
high
in
may
m
suggesting
that
we
are
in
a
era
that
is
different
and
distinct
from
the
time
during
which
the
proposed
rulemaking
was
drafted
as
such
the
commission
should
take
a
renewed
look
at
its
perspective
that
political
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
2
if
the
commission
is
genuinely
concerned
about
the
impact
of
political
event
contracts
on
the
integrity
of
our
elections
it
should
strongly
consider
the
unintended
consequences
of
further
cementing
the
influence
of
unregulated
offshore
event
contract
platforms
accessible
only
to
foreign
actors
as
evidenced
by
the
aforementioned
increase
in
demand
of
polymarket
political
events
contract
product
i
urge
the
commission
to
carefully
consider
whether
it
wants
to
hand
the
gift
of
a
monopoly
on
political
event
contracts
to
polymarket
it
is
illegal
for
americans
to
participate
in
polymarket
and
as
such
it
is
only
available
to
foreign
actors
if
the
commission
is
genuinely
concerned
about
the
impact
of
political
event
contracts
on
the
integrity
of
our
elections
and
polymarket
is
becoming
an
authoritative
source
on
political
news
through
its
political
events
contracts
the
commission
should
consider
unintended
consequences
of
excluding
americans
from
these
markets
these
are
the
people
who
are
closest
to
as
chairman
benham
stated
the
uniquely
american
experience
of
participating
in
the
democratic
electoral
process
who
could
provide
improved
accuracy
to
price
discovery
on
political
topics
as
such
the
commission
should
carefully
evaluate
the
risks
of
cementing
the
influence
of
foreign
actors
through
these
unregulated
offshore
platforms
3
the
commission
can
enable
event
contracts
to
be
structured
in
ways
that
do
not
put
it
in
the
position
of
being
an
elections
cop
in
chairman
benham
statement
7
he
expresses
the
concern
that
allowing
these
contracts
would
push
the
cftc
a
financial
market
regulator
into
a
position
far
beyond
its
congressional
mandate
and
expertise
to
be
blunt
such
contracts
would
put
the
cftc
in
the
role
of
an
election
cop
this
seems
like
it
could
be
easily
avoided
by
ensuring
clear
resolution
terms
for
a
contract
for
example
rather
than
a
contract
that
resolves
according
to
a
particular
winner
of
an
election
the
commission
could
require
event
contracts
along
the
lines
of
who
will
be
president
on
january
21st
2025
the
day
after
inauguration
day
with
clear
instructions
including
potential
delay
in
resolution
as
needed
in
the
event
of
any
disputes
similarly
the
commission
could
decide
not
to
permit
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
but
permit
an
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
such
as
whether
a
certain
individual
is
reported
by
the
new
york
times
as
being
sworn
in
on
inauguration
day
the
commission
would
therefore
be
only
responsible
for
investigating
fraud
manipulation
and
the
like
to
the
reporting
by
such
an
organization
not
the
underlying
political
events
themselves
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
proposed
public
interest
determination
with
respect
to
contracts
involving
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
4
the
commission
interpretation
about
political
event
contracts
involves
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
is
misguided
upon
closer
reading
of
the
authority
given
to
the
commission
even
if
the
commission
believes
that
political
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
i
agree
with
kalshi
argument
that
the
commission
authority
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
limited
only
to
if
the
contract
one
of
six
enumerated
activities
including
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
given
that
elections
are
not
unlawful
then
contracts
on
them
should
not
be
subject
to
the
public
interest
evaluation
the
commission
perceived
authority
to
subject
a
contract
to
an
evaluation
of
public
interest
simply
because
the
act
of
trading
on
such
contract
may
be
unlawful
under
a
state
law
is
an
overreach
it
not
the
trading
that
is
subject
to
state
law
but
rather
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
thank
you
for
your
consideration
