appreciates
the
opportunity
to

on
the

commission

or
the
commission
request
for
comment
rfc
on
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
regarding
event
contracts
in
cftc
regulated
markets
nasdaq
supports
the
commission
efforts
to
formalize
the
rules
regarding
event
contracts
but
suggests
incorporating
certain
changes
to
the
proposed
rule
in
particular
nasdaq
believes
political
event
contracts
pec
are
not
a
form
of
gambling
and
as
such
designated
contract
markets
dcms
should
be
allowed
to
list
such
contracts
for
trading
pursuant
to
of
the
commission
regulations
nasdaq
appreciates
the
thoughtful
series
of
questions
included
in
the
rfc
and
submits
the
comments
below
with
the
intent
of
aiding
the
commission
in
appropriately
regulating
event
contract
markets
in
the
united
states
we
look
forward
to
ongoing
engagement
with
the
commission
as
it
considers
adopting
policy
in
this
space
as
a
preliminary
matter
nasdaq
would
like
to
voice
its
support
for
the
commission
overall
proposal
to
exclude
event
contracts
that
involve
terrorism
assassination
war
and
illegal
activities
nasdaq
agrees
with
the
commission
that
event
contracts
focused
on
these
topics
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
should
be
prohibited
from
being
listed
on
a
dcm
in
the
context
of
gaming
nasdaq
also
believes
that
the
proposal
to
exclude
event
contracts
is
appropriate
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
allow
state
gaming
regulators
to
continue
to
exert
jurisdiction
in
this
space
nasdaq
disagrees
however
with
the
commission
proposal
to
include
pecs
within
the
definition
of
gaming
for
the
reasons
outlined
below
nasdaq
suggests
the
commission
revise
its
proposed
rule
and
allow
for
the
listing
of
such
contracts
on
dcms
nasdaq
believes
allowing
the
listing
and
trading
of
pecs
will
enhance
the
public
interest
by
providing
valuable
insight
into
the
state
of
the
political
environment
in
the
united
states
and
abroad
pecs
will
also
benefit
from
the
system
of
federal
regulation
that
cftc
would
provide
in
this
marketplace
pecs
are
contracts
that
pay
out
based
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
or
the
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
of
an
event
related
to
a
political
event
pecs
can
serve
as
a
valuable
source
of
information
for
policymakers
analysts
journalists
and
the
general
public
as
they
reflect
the
aggregated
beliefs
and
expectations
of
market
participants
and
members
of
the
voting
public
pecs
can
also
provide
incentives
for
information
discovery
and
dissemination
pecs
have
been
traded
on
various
platforms
such
as
predictit
iowa
electronic
markets
and
betfair
for
many
years
and
have
attracted
significant
attention
and
participation
from
the
public
pecs
can
offer
a
useful
tool
in
analyzing
elections
and
other
political
phenomena
as
they
can
complement
traditional
sources
of
information
such
as
polls
surveys
and
expert
opinions
furthermore
pecs
possess
certain
characteristics
that
make
them
better
suited
to
predicting
the
outcome
of
a
given
election
than
alternative
sources
of
information
for
example
most
pec
markets
operate
on
a
continuous
basis
with
price
formation
taking
place
through
the
purchase
and
sale
of
contracts
throughout
the
election
cycle
by
a
large
number
of
market
participants
the
price
discovery
that
takes
place
through
this
process
is
based
on
a
large
pool
of
data
and
therefore
a
sound
representation
of
the
sentiment
of
the
voting
public
in
contrast
a
poll
of
potential
voters
can
be
influenced
by
the
questions
asked
by
the
polling
entity
the
number
of
individuals
polled
and
the
public
sentiment
at
the
specific
time
the
poll
was
conducted
pec
markets
on
the
other
hand
represent
public
opinion
on
an
ongoing
basis
and
incorporate
all
publicly
available
information
about
the
election
in
real
time
there
is
empirical
data
supporting
the
position
that
the
pec
markets
provide
a
better
forecast
of
election
results
than
polling
while
there
is
a
positive
correlation
between
pec
results
and
polling
outcomes
data
suggests
that
pecs
provide
a
more
accurate
assessment
of
voter
sentiment
of
real
time
developments
during
the
election
cycle
and
are
better
at
forecasting
the
winner
as
the
election
draws
closer

research
also
suggests
that
event
contracts
in
general
produce
accurate
and
reliable
forecasts
due
to
three
factors
the
market
mechanism
itself
is
an
algorithm
for
aggregating
information
there
is
a
financial
incentive
to
be
truthful
when
trading
in
contracts
in
order
to
reap
the
benefits
of
operating
under
correct
assumptions
and
the
existence
of
the
market
provides
incentives
for
discovering
new
information
and
trading
based
on
that
information

it
is
notable
that
these
factors
are
not
present
in

suggests
that
event

are
difficult
to
manipulate
i

at

citing
multiple
studies
suggesting
prediction
markets
are
difficult
to
manipulate
the
commission
should
also
consider
that
pecs
do
not
possess
certain
core
characteristics
that
are
found
in
gaming
contracts
and
for
that
reason
should
be
allowed
to
trade
on
cftc
regulated
markets
unlike
gaming
contracts
pecs
serve
a
broader
purpose
than
merely
providing
a
means
of
entertainment
for
the
trader
of
the
contract
as
noted
above
pecs
are
a
form
of
information
aggregation
and
expression
that
provide
a
means
of
determining
voter
sentiment
the
trading
volume
change
in
value
of
individual

and

throughout

lifecycle
of
the
election
allow
political
and
social
scientists
to
assess
the
current
and
future
state
of
the
political
environment
in
the
united
states
pecs
do
not
involve
the
same
social
harms
or
negative
risks
as
gaming
such
as
addiction
crime
or
corruption
on
the
contrary
political
event
contracts
can
promote
civic
engagement
political
literacy
and
public
discourse
nasdaq
would
also
like
to
note
that
allowing
for
the
listing
and
trading
of
pecs
will
bring
transparency
to
the
market
and
allow
it
to
operate
under
a
unified
umbrella
of
national
regulation
relegating
pecs
to
the
purview
of
individual
states
will
have
multiple
drawbacks
first
it
will
prevent
residents
in
certain
states
from
participating
in
these
markets
since
gaming
is
not
legal
in
all
fifty
states
second
dividing
the
same
pec
across
multiple
states
will
reduce
the
trading
volume
and
market
participants
for
identical
contracts
thus
reducing
the
benefit
obtained
by
allowing
large
pools
of
market
participants
and
the
resulting
data
their
trading
produces
to
trade
within
one
market
the
true
value
of
data
obtained
from
any
individual
pec
comes
in
large
part
from
the
aggregation
of
large
pools
of
data
associated
with
the
trading
in
a
single
national
market
dividing
an
election
into
dozens
of
individual
markets
will
limit
the
value
and
accuracy
of
the
data
from
any
individual
market
within
a
given
state
we
would
further
note
that
the
commission
should
place
certain
limitations
on
pecs
as
it
does
with
other
commodity
markets
to
mitigate
the
potential
for
manipulation
price
distortion
and
disruption
excessive
speculation
and
other
related
market
abuses
nasdaq
believes
clearly
defined
position
limit
rules
accountability
regimes
when
trading
in
a
specific
market
are
prudent
regulatory
tools
to
ensure
a
well
functioning
and
transparent
pec
market
additionally
individual
trades
in
pecs
could
have
specific
dollar
limits
as
an
additional
mechanism
to
prohibit
manipulative
and
fraudulent
behavior
position
limits
can
further
be
defined
for
individuals
and
bona
fide
market
makers
subject
to
certain
obligations
we
believe
the
above
is
in
the
public
interest
and
will
benefit
prediction
markets
for
the
foregoing
reasons
we
recommend
that
the
commission
adopt
a
clear
and
consistent
definition
of
event
contracts
that
excludes
pecs
from
the
scope
of
gaming
or
wagering
we
believe
that
regulating
event
contracts
especially
pecs
will
bring
many
benefits
to
the
marketplace
and
the
political
discourse
in
the
united
states
regulation
will
provide
legal
certainty
and
legitimacy
to
pec
markets
and
platforms
which
will
encourage
innovation
and
competition
regulation
will
also
enhance
transparency
and
accountability
which
will
reduce
fraud
manipulation
and
abuse
we
thank
the
commission
for
its
leadership
and
vision
in
proposing
a
regulatory
framework
for
event
contracts
we
hope
that
our
comments
and
suggestions
will
be
helpful
in
the
finalization
and
implementation
of
the
rulemaking
we
look
forward
to
working
with
the
commission
and
other
stakeholders
in
developing
and
promoting
event
contract
markets
and
platforms
sincerely
yours
