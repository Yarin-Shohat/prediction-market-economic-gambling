i
am
writing
to
express
my
concerns
regarding
the
proposed
ban
on
election
event
contracts
and
to
request
clarification
on
several
key
points
while
i
understand
the
cftc
desire
to
protect
market
integrity
and
public
interest
i
believe
this
proposal
raises
important
questions
that
deserve
thorough
consideration
and
public
discussion
to
that
end
i
respectfully
submit
the
following
questions
for
the
commission
response
1
how
does
the
cftc
reconcile
the
proposed
ban
with
its
mandate
to
foster
open
transparent
and
competitive
markets
does
prohibiting
election
contracts
contradict
this
core
mission
2
what
specific
evidence
does
the
cftc
have
that
election
contracts
pose
a
threat
to
market
integrity
or
the
democratic
process
can
this
evidence
be
made
public
3
has
the
cftc
conducted
a
comprehensive
cost
benefit
analysis
of
banning
election
contracts
if
so
can
this
analysis
be
shared
with
the
public
4
how
does
the
cftc
respond
to
arguments
that
election
contracts
serve
legitimate
economic
purposes
such
as
hedging
political
risk
for
businesses
5
what
alternatives
to
an
outright
ban
has
the
cftc
considered
for
example
has
enhanced
oversight
or
more
stringent
reporting
requirements
been
explored
6
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
address
the
potential
shift
of
election
betting
activity
to
unregulated
offshore
markets
if
these
contracts
are
banned
in
the
us
7
what
specific
statutory
authority
is
the
cftc
relying
on
to
justify
this
ban
how
does
the
commission
interpret
the
limits
of
its
authority
in
this
area
8
has
the
cftc
consulted
with
academic
researchers
who
study
prediction
markets
if
so
how
has
their
input
been
incorporated
into
this
proposal
9
how
does
the
cftc
plan
to
define
and
distinguish
between
prohibited
election
contracts
and
other
event
contracts
that
may
have
political
implications
10
measures
will
the
cftc
take
to
ensure
that
banning
election
contracts
does
stifle
innovation
in
financial
markets
more
broadly
11
the
cftc
considered
the
potential
impact
of
this
ban
on
market
liquidity
and
price
discovery
for
related
financial
instruments
12
does
the
cftc
respond
to
arguments
that
election
contracts
enhance
transparency
and
provide
valuable
information
to
the
public
and
policymakers
13
specific
concerns
does
the
cftc
have
about
the
potential
for
market
manipulation
in
election
contracts
and
how
do
these
differ
from
concerns
in
other
markets
14
the
cftc
considered
allowing
election
contracts
but
with
additional
safeguards
or
restrictions
if
so
what
options
were
explored
15
does
the
cftc
plan
to
enforce
this
ban
particularly
given
the
global
nature
of
online
prediction
markets
16
input
has
the
cftc
received
from
other
regulatory
agencies
or
elected
officials
regarding
this
proposal
can
this
input
be
made
public
17
does
the
cftc
reconcile
this
ban
with
its
previous
allowance
of
certain
election
related
contracts
such
as
those
offered
by
predictit
18
recourse
will
be
available
for
market
participants
who
believe
their
contracts
have
been
incorrectly
classified
as
prohibited
election
contracts
19

the
cftc
plan
to
address

concerns
related
to
restricting
election
related
speech
and
expression
through
these
markets
20
ongoing
review
process
will
the
cftc
implement
to
assess
the
impact
and
effectiveness
of
this
ban
if
it
is
enacted
i
believe
these
questions
are
crucial
for
understanding
the
full
implications
of
the
proposed
ban
on
election
contracts
i
urge
the
commission
to
provide
detailed
responses
to
these
inquiries
and
to
engage
in
a
transparent
public
dialogue
on
this
important
issue
before
proceeding
with
any
final
rulemaking

your
consideration
of
these
questions
