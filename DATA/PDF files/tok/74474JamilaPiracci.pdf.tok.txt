historical
commitment
to
the
integrity
of

and
innovative

markets
this
comment
letter
seeks
to
highlight
certain
avoidable
pitfalls
in
the
proposal
that
could
frustrate
that
mission
it
is
fundamental
to
treat
market
integrity
as
a
concept
that
should
hold
and
not
eschew
the
tension
between
innovation
and
safety
with
that
in
mind
roos
joins
many
others
in
responding
to
the
commission
request
for
comments
on
the
proposed
rule
and
oers
the
suggestions
below
to
aid
the
commission
in
achieving
the
balance
it
seeks
helpful
aspects
of
the
proposed
rule
the
cftc
should
be
applauded
for
initiating
a
rulemaking
process
rather
than
engaging
in
regulation
through
enforcement
a
pernicious
approach
that
deprives
market
participants
of
advance
warning
of
the
rules
of
engagement
in
the
marketplace
and
simultaneously
forces
them
to
pay
for
the
lesson
through
nes
and
reputational
damage
another
unappealing
approach
to
the
matters
discussed
in
the
proposed
rule
would
be
oering

time
limited
no
action
relief
is
a
tool
that
the
cftc
has
experienced
pressure
to
use
in
the
past
such
as
when
the
pace
and
volume
of
rulemaking
have
made
the
diculties
of
strategic
regulatory
implementation
harder
than
usual
although
sometimes
appropriate
such
an
approach
is
suboptimal
when
it
is
used
to
kick
the
can
of
regulatory
clarity
indenitely
down
the
road
for
market
participants
in
addition
to
the
prudence
of
making
the
eort
to
craft
regulations
rather
than
imposing
costly
after
the
fact
signals
of
danger
zones
or
instituting
temporary
measures
through
the
rulemaking
process
the
commission
provides
the
public
with
an
opportunity
to
comment
and
provide
input
the
commission
has
taken
that
obligation
seriously
as
shown
by
its
announcement
of
an
extension
of
time
to
allow
constructive
comments
to
be
shared
in
this
nuanced
area

opportunities
to
correct
flaws
in
the
proposed
rule
the
commission
has
frequently
reiterated
its
embrace
of
responsible
innovation
as
required
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
commodity
exchange
act
cea
7
code
as
discussed
below
one
should
consider
whether
the
adjective
responsible
overshadows
the
noun
innovation
responsible
innovation
the
proposed
rule
appears
to
suppress
rather
than
promote
responsible
innovation
the
proposed
rule
states
that
helping
registered
entities
ensure
compliance
would
support
responsible
market
innovation
proposed
rule
48972
while
it
is
arguable
that
the
limiting
term
responsible
might
be
addressed
by
compliance
enhancement
it
takes
more
than
a
stretch
of
imagination
to
understand
how
curbing
behavior
appropriate
as
that
is
supports
innovation
much
less
promotes
it
elsewhere
the
proposed
rule
states
that
making
informed
business
decisions
supports
responsible
innovation
proposed
rule
pp

again
making
business
decisions
informed
or
otherwise
is
not
very
cutting
edge
rather
it
is
at
best
the
sustenance
of
the
status
quo
in
any
commercial
enterprise
furthermore
the
proposed
rule
refers
to
the
support
of
responsible
innovation
the
statutory
obligation
is
to
promote
it
see
cea
7
code
given
that
the
congress
has
imposed
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
cftc
to
promote
responsible
innovation
the
commission
needs
to
demonstrate
actions
that
move
innovation
forward
even
while
preserving
the
limitation
that
it
be
responsible
the
proposed
rule
mentions
a
commitment
to
responsible
innovation
several
times
but
merely
concludes
that
the
proposed
rule
achieves
this
end
without
explaining
how
it
is
met
see
proposed
rule
at
pp
48969
48972
48973
the
proposed
rule
does
not
offer
any
evidence
of
actions
or
standards
of
review
that
would
promote
innovation
in
fact
even
the
unsupported
statements
that
the
rule
supports
innovation
have
the
unfortunate
internal
conflicts
of
pointing
away
from
innovation
and
toward
limitation
the
proposed
rule
conflates
concepts
muddying
the
logic
of
its
rationale
the
proposed
rule
broad
definition
of
gaming
sweeps
in
a
host
of
current
and
as
yet
unknown
products
including
those
that
simply
are
in
connection
with
the
cftc
proposed
new
definition
of
gaming
and
none
of
which
have
been
determined
to
be
illegal
by
state
or
federal
legislatures
moreover
the
proposed
rule
has
stretched
the
commission
own
understanding
of
the
word
gaming
gambling
to
include
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
proposed
rule
48988
of
course
the
words
contest
and
game
do
not
ordinarily
imply
gambling
without
more
being
said
by
its
logic
the
proposed
rule
could
allow
the
cftc
to
ban
hedging
activity
by
airlines
and
hotel
conglomerates
leading
to
the
olympics
boundaries
of
the
executive
branch
the
commission
plays
an
important
role
not
just
in
the
derivatives
markets
but
also
in
the
service
of
the
public
in
implementing
legislation
adopted
by
the
congress
the
proposed
rule
suggests
that
one
reason
for
painting
the
term
gaming
with
an
overly
broad
brush
is
to
save
costs
in
doing
the
work
of
reviewing
the
appropriateness
of
case
by
case
examples
proposed
rule
48988
saving
money
is
not
an
excuse
for
stepping
into
the
purview
of
legislators
which
unlike
the
commission
are
elected
by
the
public
and
banning
certain
activity
that
is
legal
under
relevant
legislations
the
proposed
rule
explicitly
mentions
the
commission
recognition
of
the
absence
of
a
formal
statutory
definition
of
the
term
gaming
proposed
rule
48988
as
if
that
supports
a
conclusion
that
the
cftc
should
step
into
the
presumed
breach
the
supreme
court
has
recently
addressed
the
proper
role
of
administrative
agencies
pointing
questions
of
interpretive
ambiguity
away
from
those
bodies
see
loper
bright
enterprises
raimondo
no
22
451
2024
and
other
nodes
in
a
shifting
judicial
landscape
going
forward
it
will
become
more
important
to
do
precisely
what
the
proposed
rule
seeks
to
avoid
allow
the
market
to
work
with
the
cftc
to
continue
to
develop
and
innovate
resolving
interpretive
ambiguities
on
a
case
by
case
basis
through
the
registration
contract
market
application
examination
and
self
certification
processes
that
are
already
in
place
this
would
meet
the
objective
of
promoting
innovation
in
proper
tension
with
ensuring
that
such
market
evolution
is
responsible
self
certification
the
proposed
rule
creates
uncertainty
for
existing
self
certified
products
and
in
the
process
guts
the
self
certification
framework
for
listed
derivatives
the
cftc
has
already
permitted
certain
contract
markets
that
have
self
certified
products
without
cftc
objection
the
proposed
rule
as
it
is
so
broadly
drafted
would
be
tantamount
to
retroactively
penalizing
those
organizations
despite
their
having
legally
built
businesses
to
be
in
line
with
cftc
parameters
this
comment
letter
notes
above
the
constructiveness
of
the
proposed
rulemaking
process
in
that
it
disciplines
agency
temptations
to
regulate
through
enforcement
the
proposed
rule
could
lead
to
a
result
similar
to
that
caused
by
regulation
through
enforcement
by
casting
doubt
upon
existing
businesses
the
impact
on
existing
self
certifiers
is
not
the
end
of
the
potential
damage
the
core
of
the
self
certification
process
itself
could
become
corrupted
if
the
door
is
opened
to
lawmaking
feats
by
the
agency
that
has
already
approved
contract
markets
bringing
products
to
the
marketplace
in
their
own
discretion
within
the
bounds
of
cftc
issued
core
principles
and
rules
it
would
be
unfortunate
for
the
pricing
of
derivatives
to
reflect
increased
or
erratic
regulatory
change
risk
that
exists
in
other
regions
of
the
world
conclusion
and
suggested
steps
the
commission
track
record
of
thorough
consideration
of
all
comments
received
in
rulemaking
processes
is
well
known
thus
roos
asks
that
the
commission
regard
this
and
all
other
comments
as
an
earnest
attempt
to
support
the
commission
in
its
important
and
complex
role
in
our
markets
in
that
spirit
below
are
specific
suggestions
1
the
commission
should
not
dene
gaming
on
behalf
of
the
legislature
if
the
cftc
chooses
to
provide
insights
to
the
legislature
because
of
cftc
expertise
such
guidance
should
exclude
the
overly
broad
category
of
any
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
2
the
commission
should
review
the
impact
of
the
proposed
rule
on
existing
self
certified
products
and
the
self
certification
process
to
ensure
that
rulemaking
does
not
penalize
legally
operating
organizations
attempting
to
abide
by
longstanding
cftc
principles
3
the
commission
should
take
ample
deliberative
time
to
reflect
on
the
worthwhile
dialogue
and
attention
being
given
now
to
questions
of
administrative
agency
authority
and
roles
the
long
term
value
for
our
society
and
our
markets
can
not
be
overstated
the
cftc
should
continue
to
act
with
respect
for
the
defined
role
of
the
executive
branch
and
other
branches
of
government
even
as
interpretations
of
those
roles
evolve
over
time
thank
you
again
for
considering
this
comment
letter
and
for
affording
all
of
us
the
opportunity
to
be
engaged
in
the
regulatory
process
for
the
benefit
of
our
markets
sincerely
