this

another

the

dozens

the

after

there
is

the

the
exchange
makes
the
following
points
as
well
1
elections
and
political
control
are
not
games
unlike
games
in
which
the
underlying
activity
has
no
inherent
economic
value
apart
from
the
money
wagered
on
it
political
control
has
an
obvious
and
large
economic
impact
as
it
heavily
influences
expectations
and
the
likelihood
of
public
policy
change
as
gregory
kuserk
noted
unlike
games
elections
are
events
that
are
very
important
to
the
public
and
there
is
a
very
strong
public
interest
in
having
accurate
data

elections
are
not
games
full
stop
indeed
the
nadex
order
did
not
identify
political
elections
themselves
the
core
of
american
democracy
as
being
a
game

trading
on
congressional
control
is
not
gaming
the
nadex
order
asserted
that
gaming
is
equivalent
to
placing
a
wager
or
bet
and
it
cited
a
federal
statute
that
defined
the
term
bet
or
wager
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
nadex
order
at
3
if
taking
a
position
on
a
congressional
control
contract
is
equivalent
to
a
wager
or
bet
because
it
places
money
on
an
event
outcome
that
would
imply
that
taking
a
position
in
any
event
contract
is
also
equivalent
to
a
wager
or
bet
some
commentators
appear
to
equate
speculation
with
gaming
and
do
not
sympathize
with
the
important
role
speculation
plays
in
price
discovery
and
risk
transfer
many
commodity
futures
markets
such
as
those
in
oil
often
feature
large
amounts
of
speculative
behavior
yet
clearly
do
not
constitute
gaming
contracts
this
is
not
true
in
law
while
gambling
is
illegal
in
many
states
and
interstate
betting
is
prohibited
event
contracts
are
legal
in
all
jurisdictions
as
former
commissioner
quintenz
wrote
gaming
describes
wagering
money
on
an
occurrence
that
has
no
inherent
economic
value
itself
other
than
the
money
wagered
on
its
outcome
for
instance
wagering
money
on
roulette
or
blackjack
should
be
considered
gaming
because
there
is
no
economic
significance
of
the
activity
apart
from
the
wager
itself
speculation
on
the
contrary
is
risking
value
where
the
underlying
activity
has
economic
consequences
which
then
means
the
speculative
activity
creates
valuable
societal
and
economic
benefit
from
a
price
discovery
and
risk
transfer
function
for
those
exposed
to
the
risk
of
that
underlying
activity

from

relevant
language
of
involve

comes
from

this
language
can
not
be
broader
than
the
statutory
language
that
is
simply
involves
7
by
definition
if
the
regulation
applied
more
broadly
than
the
statute
it
would
per
se
violate
the
apa
and
be
invalid

2
what
role
does
the
requirement
that
the
contracts
trade
in
multiples
of
5000
the
position
limits
applicable
to
the
contracts
play
in
the
analysis
of
whether
the
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
are
the
position
limits
reasonably
enforceable
it
does
not
play
a
role
a
larger
order
size
will
likely
reduce
the
number
of
smaller
traders
and
trades
but
does
not
affect
the
contract
hedging
utility
the
position
limits
are
enforceable
kalshi
is
regulated
by
the
commission
who
can
monitor
such
behavior
other
exchanges
list
products
with
custom
order
sizes
notional
sizes
and
position
limits
as
well
there
is
no
reason
to
speculate
that
kalshi
will
somehow
not
be
able
to
enforce
this
indeed
the
division
is
well
aware
of
kalshi
ability
to
enforce
position
limits
additionally
it
is
not
clear
why
kalshi
ability
to
enforce
a
rule
is
appropriate
for
public
comment
how
is
a
member
of
the
public
supposed
to
have
information
on
kalshi
systems
and
procedures
and
internal
processes
for
compliance
it
would
seem
that
the
most
appropriate
party
to
address
this
question
to
is
kalshi
and
kalshi
notes
that
surprisingly
and
incongruously
the
commission
has
never
asked
kalshi
this
question
3
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
whether
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law

1
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
no
the
commission
should
not
consider
this
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
gaming
and
subject
to
the
special
rule
for
event
contracts
for
four
reasons
1
presence
on
an
illegal
exchange
casino
or
sportsbook
does
not
by
right
cause
relation
to
gaming
for
example
if
corn
futures
become
widely
traded
in
casinos
and
sports
books
that
would
not
change
the
nature
of
the
corn
futures
contract
into
a
gaming
contract
the
converse
is
also
true
if
a
traditional
futures
exchange
started
a
roulette
parlor
the
bets
in
the
parlor
would
still
be
gaming
2
what
is
offered
at
such
venues
changes
over
time
for
example
if
we
used
this
nature
of
the
venue
determines
nature
of
the
product
standard
many
commodity
futures
and
securities
might
have
originally
been
considered
gaming
because
bucket
shops
traded
those
products
in
large
volumes
in
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
centuries
they
may
have
continued
to
do
so
in
the
absence
of
bucket
shop
prohibitions
3
the
commission
prevented
congressional
control
contracts
from
being
listed
on
exchange
in
the
nadex
order
it
would
be
circular
to
use
the
fact
that
such
activity
has
persisted
off
exchange
as
evidence
the
activity
is
gaming
for
example
if
the
commission
prohibited
oil
futures
and
oil
futures
trading
moved
to
casinos
that
would
not
suddenly
change
the
economic
nature
of
oil
futures
4
the
commission
did
not
consider
the
venues
offering
for
example
bitcoin
contracts
prior
to
the
listing
of
bitcoin
contracts
on
dcms
if
the
commission
considered
this
inquiry
to
be
dispositive
that
something
is
gaming
those
contracts
would
be
gaming
contracts
because
of
their
large
presence
on
such
venues
however
even
if
the
commission
did
consider
venue
as
relevant
in
determining
whether
the
contracts
involve
gaming
congressional
control
is
not
offered
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
and
is
not
available
in
casinos

vegas

in

fivethirtyeight
2016
bets
on
the
control
of
congress
are
accepted
at
caesar
palace
or
the
bellagio
such
contracts
are
only
currently
offered
on
some
overseas
betting
services
and
illegal
or
unregulated
venues
in
the
united
states
instead
of
considering
venue
the
commission
should
consider
whether
the
subject
of
the
contracts
involves
gaming
when
adjudicating
whether
a
contract
involves
gaming
per
kalshi
letter
on
the
special
rule
application
2
should
the
commission
consider
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
no
for
two
reasons
first
because
per
the
special
rule
only
the
underlying
event
congressional
control
should
be
considered
in
determining
whether
the
contracts
involve
gaming
the
application
of
the
special
rule

this
question

available

taking

in

not

it

that

congress
has
repeatedly
recognized
that

serve

therefore
state

that

do
not
violate

and

all
of

shows
that
congress
and
the

understand
that
there
is
a
critical
distinction
between
betting
and
legitimate
federally
recognized
and
regulated
financial
activity
election
contracts
that
are
designed
for
price
formation
and
hedging
on
a

constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
give
consideration
of
the
definitions
under
state
and
federal
gambling
laws
as
these
laws
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to

like
kalshi
indeed
a
key
purpose
of

and
granting
the
cftc

was
to
authorize

promote
trading
of

contracts
notwithstanding
state
laws
that
might
purport

prohibit
them
as
gambling
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
is
relevant
is
if
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
violates
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evasion
in

case
congress
wanted
to
make

even
if
the
focus
comes
to
legitimizing
the
trading
on

as
part
of
the
ultimate
public

analysis
the
commission
has
already
crossed
that
bridge
by
long
permitting
market
participants
to
trade
such
contracts
pursuant
to
no
action
letters
awarded
to
unregulated

the
notion
that
allowing
a
regulated

to
offer
the
contracts
is
what
changes
the
public
interest
analysis
is
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate

the
wire
act
is
irrelevant
here
it
applies
only
to
sports
betting
and
wagering
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
addressed
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the

it
carved
out
derivatives
contracts
both
on

and
over

counter
from
the

plainly
recognizing
that

serve
economic

that

as

wagering

true
legally

in

taking

in

taking
a
position
in
an
event
contract
is
not
equivalent
to
as
states
or
the
federal
government
may
define
it
wagering
or
betting
which
they
prohibit
this
is
not
true
legally
interstate
betting
is
illegal
and
betting
is
illegal
in

event

are
legal
in
all
jurisdictions

in

as
father

richard
sandor
wrote
in
his
comment
letter
a
major
misconception
that
still
prevails
among
the
public
is
the
equivalence
of
gambling
and
speculation
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
gambling
is
an
artificial
self
constructed
risk
created
for
recreation
speculation
is
the
assumption
of
risks
that
already
exist
in
the
real
and
financial
markets
the
recreational
risk
of
gambling
is
not
present
until
the
casino
or
racetrack
is
built
and
wagers
are
accepted
on
the
other
hand
risk
in
the
production
of
good
and
services
in
the
economy
are
real
and
will
exist
even
in
the
absence
of
futures
markets
the
same
can
be
said
for
equity
and
interest
rate
and
risk
it
seems
reasonable
to
conclude
the
risks
associated
with
policy
changes
from
different
election
outcomes
are
most
similar
to
the
latter
the
transfer
of
risk
by
hedgers
would
be
real
and
the
assumption
of
that
risk
by
speculators
would
be
proper
public
comment
by
richard
sandor
available
at
taking
a
position
in
an
event
contract
is
also
not
equivalent
to
the
unlawful
activity
such
laws
refer
to
because
such
laws
are
not
operative
on
cftc
regulated
products
federal
law
definitions
of
gaming
betting
wagering
carve
out
exemptions
for
cftc
regulated
products
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
not
include
any
transaction
conducted
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
registered
entity
or
exempt
board
of
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
31
2006
many
states
gaming
provisions
also
include
such
exemptions
for
example
washington
state
rcw
clarifies
that
cftc
regulated
transactions
are
not
affected
by
its
anti
bucket

provisions
states

provisions
are
preempted
explicitly
as
well
by
the
cfma
7
usc
covers
exclusive
cftc
jurisdiction
over
futures
and
swaps
so
any
state
laws
that
would
purport
to
regulate
or
prohibit
futures
or
swaps
would
be
preempted
the
cea
also
preempts

laws
with
respect
to

products
that
are

or

this
act
shall
supersede
and
preempt
the
application
of
any
state
or
local
law
that
prohibits
or
regulates
gaming
or
the
operation
of
bucket
shops
in
the
case
of
a
an
electronic
trading
facility
excluded
under
section
of
this
act
and
b
an
agreement
contract
or
transaction
that
is
excluded
from
this
act
under
provisions
of
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
or
exempted
under
section
of
this
act
even
derivatives
products
that
are
excluded
or
exempted
from
cftc
regulation
still
preempt
state
gaming
and
bucket
shop
laws
per
the
cfma
ibid
it
could
not
follow
more
plainly
that
cftc
regulated
derivatives
have
the
same
preemptive
effect
congress
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
futures
and
other
derivative
contracts
serve
economic
purposes
and
therefore
state
laws
that
purport
to
prohibit
or
regulate
futures
or
derivative
contracts
including
gaming
laws
do
not
violate
the
cea
and
are
preempted
all
of
this
shows
that
congress
and
the
states
understand
that
there
is
a
critical
distinction
between
betting
and
legitimate
financial
activity
election
contracts
that
are
designed
for
hedging
on
a
financial
market
constitute
legitimate
financial
activity
therefore
it
would
be
incorrect
to
consider
the
contracts
as
involving
unlawful
activity
as
these
laws
themselves
recognize
they
do
not
apply
to
contracts
like
kalshi
a
key
purpose
of
the
cea
and
granting
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
futures
was
to
authorize
and
promote
trading
of
futures
contracts
notwithstanding
state
laws
that
might
purport
to
prohibit
them
as
gambling
the
only
way
in
which
state
law
is
relevant
is
if
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
violates
state
law
such
as
a
contract
on
murder
or
state
income
tax
evasion
in
that
case
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
a
futures
contract
would
not
legitimize
that
activity
without
the
commission
considering
whether
trading
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
obviously
would
not
be
concerned
about
legitimizing
elections
even
if
the
focus
comes
to
legitimizing
the
trading
on
elections
as
part
of
the
ultimate
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
has
already
crossed
that
bridge
by
long
permitting
market
participants
to
trade
such
contracts
pursuant
to
no
action
letters
awarded
to
unregulated
markets
the
notion
that
allowing
a
regulated
exchange
to
offer
the
contracts
is
what
changes
the
public
interest
analysis
is
insupportable
as
for
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
betting
the
wire
act
is
irrelevant
here
it
applies
only
to
sports
betting
and
wagering
moreover
when
congress
most
recently
addressed
the
intersection
of
gambling
gaming
and
the
internet
it
carved
out
derivatives
contracts
both
on
exchange
and
over
the
counter
from
the
definition
of
betting
and
wagering
thereby
plainly
recognizing
that
derivatives
contracts
serve
economic
purposes
that
distinguish
them
from
gambling
gaming
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
not
include
any
transaction
conducted
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
registered
entity
or
exempt
board
of
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
31
2006
congress
recognized
this
much
earlier
too
granting
the
cftc

and

would
be

the

the
theory
that
there
are
state
laws

a
federal
law
prohibiting
gambling
wagering
on

and
that
wagering
is
equivalent
to
taking
a
position
on
an

contract
that
would
mean
that
the
special
rule
is
triggered
by
any

contract
because
many
state

laws
prohibit
wagering
on
the
outcome
of
any
future
event
that
interpretation
was
clearly
not
congress
intent
instead
congress
narrowly
defined
a
small
number
of
event
contracts
whose
underlying
event
involves
an
unsavory
activity
that
congress
did
not
want
the
cftc
to
legitimize
without
evaluating
whether
trading
a
contract
on
that
activity
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
per
the
text
which
isolates
a
selected
set
of
enumerated
events
to
target
time
and
time
again
congress
and
states
have
indicated
that
the
commission
has
the
decision
making
power
here
and
approval
of
kalshi
contract
has
no
involvement
with
unlawful
activity
any
more
than
an
event
contract
on
gross
domestic

or
whether
a

becomes
law
if
the
commission
chooses
to
isolate
these
contracts
as
involving

but
not
those
many
others
it
would
be
acting
contrary

in

while
market

not
sufficient
alone
to
determine
the

it
is
undeniably
an
important
factor
that
the
commission
should
consider
in
determining
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
that
interest
it
is
unlikely
that
the

would
disagree
that
its
many
core
principles

regulatory

lead
to
a
safer

experience
for

accordingly
there
is
significant
public
interest
in
having
these

available
on
regulated

similarly
especially
with
regard
to
congressional

it
is
important
that

not
be

there
are

a
tall

given

resources
the

of
these

and
the
ease

accordingly
these

will
likely
continue
to
exist
the
question
is
whether
they
will
exist
also
in
a
regulated
market
or
remain
just
in
the
unregulated
shadow
market
this
is
of
course
not
a
reason
to
permit
the
contracts
independently
of
the
contract
economic
utility
but
it
is
an
undeniably
important
public
interest
consideration
because
the
breadth
of
the
current

is
a
more
recent
development
this
public

was
not

what
is
clear
and

is
that
this

that
is
before
the

like
the
prior
contract
can
be
used
to
hedge
risk
exposure
to

an

however
the

that

there

in

the
hedging
need
this
product
fills
1
should
the
commission
review
a
contract
hedging
function
there
is
no
requirement
from
congress
nor
mechanism
by
which
the
commission
can
or
should
determine
hedging
utility
as
a
metric
on
its
own
outside
of
the
public
interest
however
a
contract
hedging
utility
can
be
considered
as
supporting
the
public
interest
as
part
of
the
public
interest
consideration
should
the

find
that
a
contract
involves
one
of
the

activities
of
the
special

2
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
theoretical
use
or
demonstrated
need
a
contract
hedging
utility
may
be
an
important
consideration
in
favor
of
finding
that
a
contract
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
should
the
commission
find
that
it
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
of
the
special
rule
hedging
is
in
the
public
interest
and
promoting
risk
mitigation
is
a
core
mission
of
the
cftc
the
exchange
notes
however
that
these
two
suggestions
theoretical
versus
demonstrated
need
are
more
like
opposite
ends
of
a
spectrum
and
there
are
variations
in
between
it
should
use
a
theoretical
use
standard
a
demonstrated
need
standard
could
inhibit
the
creation
of
new
products
with
smaller
or
less
clear
markets
has
no
clear
mechanism
by
which
it
can
be
determined
and
because
a
contract
only
theoretically
being
used
for
hedging
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
should
not
be
missed
that
the
standard
implied
in
the
last
part
of
this
question
some
minimum
required
amount
of
hedging
in
absolute
or
percentage
terms
would
be
likely
to
have
unintended
consequences
if
imposed
on
the
market
1
this
standard
has
not
been
imposed
on
any
other
contract
in
commission
history
including
any
event
contract
there
are
only
90
million
barrels
of
oil
produced
per
day
but
almost
1
billion

are

clearly
added
value
to
the
global
financial
system
2
the
percentage
of
the
contract
participants
hedging
will
no
doubt
vary
over
time
in
a
vibrant
dynamic
marketplace
as
risks
change
3
speculation
is
an
accepted
important
use
case
for
all
contracts
in
the
financial
markets
speculation
on
events
of
economic
purpose
is
not
equivalent
to
gaming
or
gambling
and
has
never
been
considered
that
non
hedgers
help
balance
out
any
differences
between
short
and
long
hedgers
and
provide
liquidity
to
the
hedgers
themselves
without
speculation
none
of
the
major
futures
and
derivatives
markets
would
be
as
liquid
as
they
are
today
and
thus
as
powerful
in
fulfilling
the
hedging
utility
as
they
are
speculation
improves
a
contract
hedging
utility
even
in
cases
where
the
non
hedgers
are
not
actually
matching
on
the
exchange
with
the
hedgers
they
are
providing
a
valuable
service
to
the
hedgers
the
price
offered
on
an
exchange
is
a
function
of
many
factors
including
demand
and
liquidity
non
hedgers
will
demand
a
greater
premium
if
they
know
it
will
be
harder
for
them
to
exit
their
positions
later
if
their
needs
change
so
the
presence
of
later
non
hedgers
willing
to
provide
liquidity
and
trading
volume
is
essential
to
encouraging
the
original
round
of
liquidity
providers
to
offer
more
competitive
prices
to
the
hedgers
since
the
original
liquidity
providers
know
that
they
will
not
have
an
issue
exiting
their
positions
later
as
commissioner
quintenz
put
it
whereas
bettors
participate
in
games
of
pure
chance
whose
sole
purpose
is
to
completely
reward
the
winner
and
punish
the
loser
for
an
outcome
that
would
otherwise
provide
no
economic
utility
think
roulette
speculators
in
the
derivatives
market
participate
in
non
chance
driven
outcomes
that
have
price
forming
impacts
upon
which
legitimate
businesses
can
hedge
their
activities
and
cash
flows
the
other
factor
which
makes
speculation
different
than
pure
chance
gambling
is
the
price
forming
impact
it
has
on
markets
which
allow

to

are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
the
commission
question
can
be
taken
to
imply
two
different
things
either
that
the
other
products
are
linked
directly
on
the
same
risks
that
the
contracts
would
be
used
for
hedging
or
that
market
participants
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedging
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instruments
assuming
the
former
the
answer
is
yes
there
are
risks
that
can
not
be
currently
hedged
first
as
noted
by
hehmeyer
and
other
commenters
and
in
the
exchange
submission
there
are
significant
direct
non
policy
related
economic
risks
such
as
the
risks
imposed
by
political
outcomes
on
the
fortunes
of
media
personalities
media
consultants
and
others
with
connections
and
ties
to
the
party
in
power
these
risks
can
not
be
otherwise
hedged
by
traditional
products
as
discussed
earlier
changes
in
general
risk
that
a
certain
congress
could
pose
to
various
industries
can
be
discerned
well
in
advance
of
knowledge
of
the
particular
policies
that
may
be
implemented
by
that
congress
and
provide
just
as
valid
a
hedging
rationale
this
difference
results
from
the
time
horizon
between
the
election
cycle
and
the
implementation
of
a
new
congress
specific
legislative
agenda
or
its
potential
responses
to
current
events
for
example
following
the
election
of
republicans
into
congress
in
2016
many
publications
speculated
that
trade
policy
would
become
more
restrictive
however
it
was
not
known
if
this
would
come
in
the
form
of
new
trade
deals
re
negotiating
existing
trade
agreements
new
tarrifs
and
if
so
on
what
goods
and
at
what
level
international
lawsuits
and
more
another
event
contract
or
future
on
taxes
or
public
policy
would
not
have
been
very
helpful
however
the
risk
of
a
more
restrictive
policy
was
there
because
of
who
would
win
the
election
exactly
what
kalshi
contracts
allow
traders
to
hedge
another
example
is
new
legislation
that
would
burden
a
market
participant
once
the
legislation
draft
is
released
the
impact
will
begin
to
be
felt
immediately
on
assets
cash
flows
and
partnerships
as
market
participants
price
in
risk
making
a
hedge
useless
the
downside
risk
has
already
had
much
of
its
effect
markets
are
forward
looking
and
hedging
products
should
reflect
that
even
just
a
statement
by
a
politician
can
be
very
damaging

additionally
a
single
market
participant
may
face
myriad
risks
from
elections
many
firms
and
individuals
are
negatively
affected
by
a
suite
of
a
party
policies
and
thus
wish
to
hedge
the
many
different
changes
in
risk
through
a
single
contract
for
example
an
oil
company
may
wish
to
hedge
the
risk
that
a
new
democratic
government
will
come
into
office
because
that
government
could
not
only
impose
new
regulations
on
them
but
also
change
the
composition
of
existing
regulatory
bodies
and
increase
their
labor
costs
through
raising
the
minimum
wage
supporting
unionization
or
mandating
greater
health
care
benefits
for
employees
only
kalshi
proposal
lets
them
hedge
the
risk
they
actually
face
democratic
government
if
the
question
is
asking
instead
whether
market
participants
can
reasonably
approximate
the
contract
hedging
utility
via
a
melange
of
other
instruments
the
answer
is
they
can
not
many
retail
and
small
business
market
participants
do
not
have
access
to
these
other
instruments
and
the
inherent
friction
and
transaction
costs
in
arranging
these
types
of
complex
proxy
plays
is
prohibitive
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
commission
would
determine
it
in
the
public
interest
to
solely
rely
on
these
tools
that
are
inaccessible
to
many
of
the
market
participants
who
need
risk
management
tools
most
additionally
the
effectiveness
of
these
baskets
and
combination
of
instruments
to
hedge
the
risk
from
political
control
is
considerably
less
than
a
contract
directly
on
political
control
importantly
the
question
implies
that
its
answer
matters
but
does
not
explain
why
it
would
a
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
commission
is
saying
no
new
method
of
hedging
a
risk
should
be
permitted
if
there
are
other
existing
methods
of
hedging
that
risk
nowhere
in
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulations
is
there
such
a
standard
the
exchange
hopes
this
is
not
the
commission
view
as
it
has
not
been
the
exchange
experience
when
engaging
with
the
commission
on
prior
contracts
for
example
should
the
commission
say
farmers
can
buy
crop
insurance
therefore
they
should
not
have
access
to
agricultural
futures
products
furthermore
such
an
interpretation
would
be
highly
anti
competitive
such
an
interpretation
would
mean
that
if
one
firm
offers
a
contract
on
an
event
or
a
commodity
that
no
challenger
should
enter
the
market
with
a
similar
but
different
product
to
compete
with
it
in
fact
such
an
interpretation
would
consistently
punish
novel
or
innovative
products
in
many
cases
it
is
possible
to
construct
a
hedge
using
existing
products
and
attempting
to
do
so
might
be
expensive
or
incur
excess
basis
risk
the
fact
that
election
risk
has
implications
for
other
assets
is
in
fact
much
of
the
justification
for
the
contract
hedging
utility
and
would
work
in
concert
with
such
assets
many
similar
and
competing
products
are
listed
by
different
exchanges
in
order
to
promote
a
vibrant
and
competitive
marketplace
for
hedgers
this
is
also
an
important
component
of
the
contract
price
discovery
utility
discussed
in
a
later
question
such
an
interpretation
would
also
curtail
innovation
innovation
often
happens
through
iterating
on
already
successful
products
and
ideas
as
in
the
earlier
example
the
existence
of
insurance
products
would
have
inhibited
the
creation
of
futures
innovation
often
requires
creating
new
and
sometimes
flawed
products
in
order
to
try
and
optimize
use
cases
for
market
participants
hedgers
benefit
when
many
exchanges
are
launching
many
different
products
to
try
and
tailor
to
their
needs
they
suffer
when
the
government
limits
their
options
it
in
the
public
interest
for
such
innovation
to
occur
and
for
that
to
happen
the
commission
should
not
take
the
view
that
this
product
should
not
be
listed
because
it
purportedly
can
be
hedged
through
other
means

in
the
more
immediate
political

the
hedging
benefits
are
obvious
since
i
no
longer
employed
through
my
union
my
wife
no
longer
has
health
coverage
through
my
union
so
we
must
purchase
very
expensive
health
insurance
from
the
marketplace
when
it
seems
that
republicans
are
likely
to
take
control
i
can
invest
in
that
possibility
and
hedge
against
the
risk
that
her
health
insurance
premiums
will
go
up
or
that
the
subsidy
will
get
smaller
or
that
her
ability
to
purchase
insurance
at
all
is
taken
away

that

are
affected
regardless

for

media
personalities
and
companies
face
risk
from
congressional

and

early
professionals
hoping
to
work
on
capitol
hill
know
there
are
far
more
positions
available
if
their

is
victorious
as
there
are
more
congressional

committee
positions
for
them
to
staff
a
consultancy
that
specializes
in
specific
topic
areas
for
example
a
green
energy
consultancy
may
know
the
demand
for
their
services
will
decline
in
anticipation
that
their
issue
of
expertise
is
less
likely
to
be
operative
under
a

congress
these
risks
occur
regardless
of
the

that

passes
there
are
billions
of

public
comment
by
christopher
hehmeyer
available
at
although
some
commenters
claimed
election
outcomes
are
predictable
enough
to
be
a
useful
hedge
that
in
no
way
contradicts
or
even
diminishes
those
who
say
the
opposite
at
most
those
commenters
do
see
hedging
utility
for
themselves
but
they
can
not
credibly
say
especially
given
the
comment
file
that
all
the
people
who
identify
how
they
would
use
the
contracts
for
hedging
and
managing
their
risk
are
mistaken
or
deficient
in
their
ability
to
recognize
risk
and
potential
tools
to
manage
or
mitigate
that
risk
it
would
be
arbitrary
for
the
commission
to
listen
only
to
those
who
assert
that
there
is
no
hedging
use
case
for
anyone
when
there
are
many
others
who
state
that
they
would
use
the
product
for
themselves
or
their
business
as
noted
by
hehmeyer
there
is
sufficient
impact
from
elections
themselves
independent
of
the
policy
implications
of
political
control
to
not
only
justify
these
markets
economic
utility
but
to
make
them
valuable
in
addition
markets
already
believe
that
the
policy
implications
of
elections
themselves
are
sufficiently
meaningful
so
as
to
be
worth
repricing
assets
suggesting
that
they
are
predictable
enough
elections
have
vast
consequences
which
directly
impact
the
likelihood
of
events
happening
or
not
happening
such
as
a
bill
being
passed
while
it
is
true
that
there
is
some
uncertainty
about
the
precise
implementation
of
any
given
law
by
a
new
congress
what
exactly
would
the
size
of
the
stimulus
checks
be
what
exactly
would
the
new
tax
rate
be
changes
in
probabilities
are
more
than
sufficient
for
hedging
purposes
in
addition
once
the
specifics
of
a
policy
risk
have
been
announced
like
the
text
of
a
bill
it
practically
impossible
to
hedge
because
of
the
high
cost
now
that
the
probability
of
the
event
has
increased
it
important
for
a
potential
hedger
to
hedge
in
advance
of
the
specifics
of
their
risks
being
announced
changes
in
general
risk
also
can
provide
a
strong
hedging
need
as
opposed
to
the
changes
in
risk
of
a
specific
outcome
if
one
party
is
in
complete
control
of
congress
there
is
likely
to
be
a
change
in
general
risk
on
carbon
based
energy
products
and
industries
and
an
opposite
change
in
general
risk
on
renewable
energy
products
and
industries
while
the
specific
policies
implemented
may
be
hard
to
know
in
advance
that
change
in
general
risk
has
been
discussed
at
length
in
comment
letters
and
is
hedged
extensively
by
larger
institutions
through
complex
products
public
comment

available

consider
a
concrete
example
of
probabilistic
change
from
the
bond
markets
ten
percent
of
the
catastrophe
bond
market
is
in
parametric
triggers
which
means
the
bond
pays
out
if
certain
meteorological
triggers
are
met
the
bond
issuer
does
not
know
for
certain
whether
the
storm
that
meets
the
threshold
will
cause
mass
flooding
power
outages
and
property
damage
and
conversely
it
possible
that
such
damages
could
occur
with
a
storm
that
does
not
meet
the
trigger
thresholds
yet
they
use
the
bond
to
hedge
nonetheless
because
other
features
of
the
bond
hedging
wind
speed
namely
are
more
important
to
them
than
eliminating
basis
risk
moreover
even
if
a
wheat
farmer
buys
a
contract
that
pays
out
if
the
price
of
wheat
falls
below
a
certain
threshold
there
is
still
some
uncertainty
as
to
whether
that
event
will
harm
them
it
possible
that
a
wheat
falls
below
a
certain
threshold
because
weather
conditions
are
so
great
that
there
was
a
bumper
crop
and
that
the
increase
in
their
supply
offset
the
loss
in
price
or
b
that
the
national
price
does
not
perfectly
correlate
with
the
local
price
they
received
but
they
can
use
the
product
nevertheless

in

whatever

the

uses
kalshi
contracts
are

as
evidenced
by
the
public
comments
the
intended
customer
base
is
a
mixture
of
hedgers
liquidity
providers
market
makers
forecasters
and
speculators
this
is
consistent
with
the
customer
base
of
some
of
the
world
largest
commodity
markets
and
is
thus
wholly
permissible
the
commission
would
be
speculating
to
suggest
otherwise

should

however
it

this
would
be
very

customer
bases
change
over
time
in
many
cases
an
exchange
may
use
a
product
in

to
attract
a
new
customer
base
so
using
past
customers
as
the
foundation
for
guessing
what
the

is
would
be
erroneous
if
anything
this
test
would
inappropriately
penalize
any
novel
product
as
those
are
the
products
most
likely
to
have
an
intended
customer
base
most
different
from
the
existing

base
in
short
there
is
no

in

for
the

about
whether

also
not

it
may
affect
the

what
purpose
and
in

capacity
but
nonetheless
the
contract
can
not
serve
less
of
a
hedging
function
because
of
the
proposed
trade
size
which
is
neither
exceptionally
small

2
does
the
requirement
that
all
contracts
listed
on
kalshi
must
be
fully
collateralized
affect
this
analysis
whether
a
contract
is
fully
collateralized
or
margined
should
not
influence
the
commission
thinking
further
in
this
case
it
would
be
irrelevant
the
hedging
use
cases
shown
by
the
public
comments
and
other
evidence
provided
to
the
commission
by
kalshi
show
that
there
is
no
basis
to
conclude
that
full
collateralization
will
deter
or
preclude
hedging
behavior
individuals
small
businesses
and
medium
sized
businesses
are
all
interested
in
using
the
contracts
as
they
stand
and
as
kalshi
proposed
accordingly
even
if
the
commission
considered
the
full
collateralization
requirement
it
would
still
easily
pass
the
test
there
is
one
area
where
the
full
collateralization
requirement
becomes
relevant
and
that
is
in
regard
to
responsible
innovation
as
a
foray
into
quasi
new
territory
it
makes
sense
that
the
exchange
has
certified
only
a
fully
collateralized
product
this
requirement
will
prevent
excessive
leveraging
and
while
it
certainly
may
be
appropriate
to
have
margin
products
on
this
in
the
future
as
an
initial
product
it
is
prudent
and
sensible
to
maintain
kalshi
requirement
that
the
contract
be
fully
collateralized
indeed
kalshi
should
be
commended
for
its
cautious
approach
to
innovation

responses
outside

test
there
is

not

hedging
is

and
promoting
risk
mitigation
is
a
core
mission
of
the
cftc
in
addition
as
argued
above
the
commission
should
not
speculate
about
the
exact
amount
or
percentage
of
total
trading
that
will
be
used
to
hedge
instead
it
should
consider
whether
there
are
hedging
use
cases
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
the
contracts
to
be
utilized
for
hedging
as
often
as
the
market
sees
fit
to
hedge
many
contracts
listed
by
other
exchanges
are
traded
very
little
at
all
in
fact
it
is
in
the
public
interest
for
the
market
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
contract
design
is
appropriate
for
hedging
not
the
commission
if
the
contract
design
is
a
poor
fit
for
hedging
needs
which
it
does
not
appear
to
be
especially
given
the
many
public
comments
by
retail
small
businesses
and
industry
in
support
then
kalshi
will
attract
fewer
participants
and
in
the
future
will
amend
the
contract
structure
to
improve
the
incentives
of
the
exchange
and
hedgers
are
aligned
substituting
the
commission
judgment
for
the
market
would
short
circuit
that
valuable
process
accordingly
the
commission
inquiry
into
hedging
as
part
of
its
public
interest
inquiry
should
be
whether
the
contracts
can
be
used
for
hedging
as
noted
however
the
contracts
here
have
significant
hedging
utility
that
would
pass
any
of
these
tests
moreover
different
firms
have
different
hedging
needs
and
different
structures
can
best
meet
those
needs
what
works
for
one
firm
may
not
work
best
for
another
firm
as
a
result
the
commission
should
not
attempt
to
speculate
about
whether
a
particular
structure
would
work
as
they
may
miss
many
firms
for
whom
an
alternative
structure
is
better
the
utility
of
the
market
is
that
there
exists
a
profit
incentive
to
create
products
for
even
niche
groups
of
buyers
and
insofar
as
private
firms
are
far
closer
to
their
potential
customer
base
than
a
government
agency
which
does
not
interact
with
them
on
a
daily
basis
unlike
an
exchange
it
would
be
highly
inappropriate
for
the
commission
to
impose
its
judgment
about
whether
a
product
structure
meets
potential
customer
needs
it
in
the
public
interest
to
permit
innovative
contracts
that
they
may
use

useful
for
hedging
nonbinary
economic
events
on
a
superficial
level
congressional
control
is
one
of
the
most
true
binary
events
in
the
world
either
the
republicans
win
or
the
democrats
win
while
the
margin
in
each
chamber
certainly
matters
a
53
democrat
senate
does
look
different
from
a
50
democrat
senate
there
is
a
sharp
binary
discontinuity
in
economic
effects
when
control
tips
from
one
party
to
another
perhaps
the
commission
might
argue
that
while
congressional
control
is
binary
the
effects
of
congressional
control
are
non
binary
some
people
like
energy
firms
might
be
affected
a
lot
whereas
other
people
like
an
it
consultancy
might
be
affected
relatively
less
then
there
exists
a
continuum
between
the
energy
firm
and
the
it
consultant
of
people
affected
however
it
does
not
follow
that
binary
events
can
not
be
a
suitable
tool
for
hedging
since
the
effects
are
still
caused
by
the
binary
control
but
more
importantly
binary
products
are
still
capable
of
hedging
non
binary
events

consider
the
following
example
a
junior
investment
bank

been
instructed
to
price
a
security
that
price
is
reflective
of
the
stocks
net
present
value
itself
a
reflection
of
future
expected
profits
this
includes
political
risk
if
that
banker
knew
with
certainty
that
republicans
will
take
control
of
congress
for
example
and
corporate
taxes
will
not
be
raised
she
would
price
the
security
higher
than
otherwise
kalshi
contracts
would
help
her
in

are

take

of

elections
cause
extremely
large
economic
impacts
and
are
some
of
the
biggest
risks
that
many
businesses
will
ever
face
this
is
detailed
at

i
along

would
regularly

by
providing
an
instant
check
against
pundits
a
market
based
price
created
by
the
contracts
can
aid
information
aggregation
for
the
public
for
the
numerically
inclined
or
the
financially
minded
a
viewer
can
see
that
one
commentator
is
asserting
that
candidate
x
is
a
sure
thing
but
the
kalshi
contract
gives
them
only
a
20
chance
of
winning
they
now
have
a
competing
alternative
to
that
pundit
information
markets
tend
to
be
more
accurate
than
any
pundit
or
forecasting
alternatives
the
efficient
price
discovering
nature
of
markets
in
a
wide
range
of
contexts
is
a
well
substantiated
finding
in
academic
research
the
collective
wisdom
of
many
people
who
have
a
direct
monetary
stake
in
the
outcome
results
in
a
valuable
price
signal
weather
derivatives
and
agricultural
futures
are
better
at
predicting
the

than
meteorologists
markets
trading
on
the
reproducibility
of
scientific
research
are
better
at
discovering
which
papers
will
reproduce
than
experts
who
do
no
better
than
chance
most
importantly
research
studying
iem
and
predictit
have
confirmed
that
markets
provide
more
accurate
information
than
traditional
forecasting
methods
kalshi
contracts
would
provide
a
visible
well
trusted
benchmark
against
which
to
evaluate
a
pundit
predictive
power
as
professor
tetlock
observed
prudent
consumers
should
become
suspicious
when
they
confront
a
public
record
of
poor
performance
relative
to
the
market
in
tetlock
words
unadjusted
ex

forecasting
performance
tells
consumers
in

the

either
election
integrity

the
perception

instead
it
would

them
both
not
threatening

it

rather
than

the

suggestion
that

been
disproven
by

success
without
any
claim
of

proof
of
election
impropriety
driven

what

for

people
could
just
point
to
the

ask

why
they

deeply
dependent

entire

and
yet
attempts

are
unlikely

successful
manipulation
even
more
so
thanks
to
the
large
decentralized
nature
of
elections
strong
political
norms
and
laws
protecting
the
vote
these
contracts
do
not
change
much
less
materially
change
the
fact
that

already

large

the
only

a

other

take

may
also

to
give

this
concern
has
been

several
times
by

have
concluded
that
all

have
failed
koleman

strumpf
in

examined
previous

political

markets
and
found
that
no
previous

at

was
capable
of
sustaining
anything
more
than
fleeting

movements
they
wrote
we
find
little

manipulating

moreover
the

were

smaller

thus

than
a

manipulation

is
even

plausible
indeed
as
george
mason
university

at

barbara
professor
ryan
oprea
found
one
major
reason
why
political

are

attempts
is
that
any

induces

these

frequently

there
are
no
indications
that
the

let
alone
a
successful

however
if
the
commission
is
concerned
that
election
markets
could
nevertheless
create
election
integrity
threats
it
is
imperative
to
shift
trading
to
an

compliant
with
the
core
principles
with
insider
trading
protections
surveillance
and
kyc
in
this
way
among
others

kyc
verification
and
monitoring
system
the

also
cross
checks
applicants
against
comprehensive
databases
in
particular
the
exchange
will
check
whether
any
members
trading
on
these

are
on

politically
engaged
persons
the
exchange
further
cross
checks
applicants
against
databases
of
family
members
and
close
associates
of
politically
engaged
persons
these
checks
help
to
further
reduce
the
potential
for
trading
violations
and
further
increase
the
integrity
of
this
contract
the
contracts
would
promote
the
public
perception
in
election
integrity
by
providing
an
accurate
and
competing
tool
for
election
forecasting
as
described
in
detail
in
the
second
part
of
this
question
response
there
is
immense
social
value
in
accurate
election
forecasts
this
will
fight
disinformation
and
promote
truth
with
politics
increasing
voter
confidence
and
engagement
decreasing
partisanship
studies
consistently
show
that
polarization
and
partisanship
has
increased
dramatically
in
the
last
few
decades
every
year
greater
numbers
of
people
say
they
believe
people
from
the
opposite
party
are
immoral
and
express
other
hostile
sentiments
more
concerning
than
mere
hostility
is
how
partisan
antipathy
can
create
alternative
sets
of
facts
voters
from
different
parties
simply
believe
two
sets
of
facts
about
the
world
it
is
from
this
miasma
where
conspiracy
theories
about
stolen
elections
emerge
that
damage
the
electoral

prediction
markets
can
help
remedy
this
problem

beliefs
about

if
they
were
given
a
lesser
financial
prize
for
answering
unsure
versus
none
for
being
wrong
and
a
greater
amount
for
getting
it
correct
the
gap
shrunk
by
about
80
percent
the
reasoning
roughly
tracks
as
follows
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
conflate
their
beliefs
as
preferences
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
is
definitely
going
to
win
the
2024
presidential
elections
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenged
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odds
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
express
beliefs
as
mere
signaling
lending
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
is
at
stake
they
are
able
to
differentiate
their
beliefs
from
their
preferences
in
other
words
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrinks
and
individuals
who
trade
on
election
markets
become
more
attune
to
facts
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
in
conclusion
the
contracts
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
it
strongly
supports
the
public
interest
as
demonstrated
by
the
evidence
above
the
contracts
will
improve
asset
pricing
provide
risk
management
opportunities
enhance
election
integrity
and
trust
and
shift
trading
activity
to
regulated
exchanges

of
those

organized
to
suit
this
question
1
the
contracts
will
not
harm
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of
election
integrity
it
is
important
for
the
commission
to
engage
with
the
evidence
on
election
integrity
rather
than
speculate
the
nadex
order
suggestion
that
voters
could
be
incentivized
to
switch
their
votes
and
thus
harm
election
integrity
was
outright
speculative
in
2012
and
has
since
been
disproven
by
predictit
success
without
any
claim
of
let
alone
proof
of
election
impropriety
driven
by
those
markets
today
election

remains
alive
and
well
in
other

and

the

several

what
experience

cftc
really
does
have
anything
substantial
to
worry
about
in
allowing

events
if
anything
they
heightened

engagement

chief

of

even

and
for
that
brief
period
whenever
blowhard
partisans
insisted
that
some
outcome
was
going
to
happen
people
could
just
point
to
the
ipredict
price
on
the
event
and
ask
them
why
they
thought
that
price
was
wrong
and
whether
they
actually
put
their
money
where

the

are
deeply
dependent

entire

almost

the

and
yet
attempts

are
unlikely

successful

even
more
so
thanks
to
the
large
decentralized
nature
of
elections
strong
political
norms
and
laws
protecting
the
vote
these
contracts
do
not
change
much
less
materially
change
the
fact
that

already

large

the
only
groups
that

directly
affect

extremely
unlikely

their

them

members

also
have

other

the

misaligned

when

these
misinformed
incentives
tend
to
come
from
three
sources
first
pundits
may
want
to
hype
up
a
preferred
candidate
chances
in
order
to
flatter
the
sensibilities
of
their
audience
second
pundits
may
want
to
directly
contradict
a
so
called
mainstream
line
about
a
candidate
winning
in
order
to
gin
up
controversy
and
draw
more
clicks
or
viewership
as
a
result
they
may
claim
an
underdog
is
actually
the
true
favorite
and
to
further
court
controversy
and
viewership
claim
that
evidence
to
the
contrary
is
a
function
of
fraud
and
deception
third
even
when
pundits
attempt
to
be
honest
viewers
themselves
may
seek
out
information
that
confirms
their
own
biases
thus
rewarding
a
subset
of
relatively
dishonest
commentators
with
greater
advertising
revenue
from
the
increased
viewership
or
readership
in

we
have
empirical
evidence
of
the
dismal
performance
of

in

the

indeed
we
would
contend
that
the
benefit

on
reducing

large

partisanship
studies
consistently
show
that
polarization
and
partisanship
has
increased

in
the
last
few
decades
every
year
greater
numbers
of
people
say
they
believe

from

express

hostile

more
concerning
than
mere

is
how
partisan
antipathy
can
create

voters
from

if

if
they
were
given
a
lesser
financial
prize
for
answering
unsure
versus
none
for
being
wrong
and
a
greater
amount
for
getting
it
correct
the
gap
shrunk
by
about
80
percent
the
reasoning
roughly
tracks
as
follows
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
conflate
their
beliefs
as
preferences
for
example
a
highly
partisan
liberal
may
say
that
a
democratic
party
candidate
is
definitely
going
to
win
the
2024
presidential
elections
this
year
a
belief
when
in
reality
they
merely
want
the
democrat
to
win
the
championship
a
preference
however
that
same
individual
when
challenged
to
trade
money
on
that
definite
prediction
will
re
evaluate
and
calculate
the
odds
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
should
take
that
trade
in
short
when
no
money
is
at
stake
people
express
beliefs
as
mere
signaling
lending
itself
to
heavy
partisan
bias
when
money
is
at
stake
they
are
able
to
differentiate
their
beliefs
from
their
preferences
in
other
words
the
partisan
reality
gap
shrinks
and
individuals
who
trade
on
election
markets
become
more
attune
to
facts
and
less
to
partisan
groupthink
empowering
researchers
and
policymakers
one
of
the
most
exciting
applications
of
election
event
contracts
is
their
ability
to
provide
powerful
new
causal
inference
tools
to
researchers
and
policymakers
right
now
estimating
the
effect
of
elections
is
rather
difficult
one
can
not
merely
compare
economic
outcomes
during
one
presidential
administration
versus
another
because
the
underlying
conditions
have
dramatically
changed
likewise
comparing
forward
looking
financial
indicators
before
and
after
election
day
runs
into
several
problems
including
that
many
markets
are
closed
overnight
and
that
the
market
has
already
priced
in
some
probability
of
the
eventual
victor
winning
enter
political
control
contracts
if
party
x
has
a
80
percent
chance
of
winning
and
then
when
they
actually
win
on
election
night
a
stock
goes
up
1
we
can
say
that
the
total
effect
of
the
election
was
5
percentage
point
if
going
from
80
to
100
is
1
then
going
from
0
to
100
is
roughly
5
but
it
can
get
even
stronger
since
researchers
would
now
have
a
time
series
of
how
the
probabilities
change
over
time
they
can
use
other
events
like
debates
prominent
speeches
and
the
revelation
of
major
scandals
to
regress
forward
looking
financial
variables
on
election
outcomes
in
a
way
impossible
without
prediction
markets
these
tools
are
far
from
hypotheticals
economists
justin
wolfers
and
eric
zitzewitz
have
already
conducted
several
studies
that
used
previous
prediction
markets
like
the
iowa
electronic
exchange
to
discern
the
effects
of
political
outcomes
on
economic
variables

however
the
lack
of
liquidity
on
their
underlying
markets
makes
their
studies
relatively
under
powered
having
a
transparent
regulated
exchange
with
greater
liquidity
could
dramatically
expand
the
universe
of
questions
researchers
could
answer
with
this
data
beyond
researchers
a
transparent
regulated
exchange
would
create
a
large
incentive
for
traders
to
develop
sophisticated
and
accurate
models
about
election
outcomes
in
order
to
gain
an
edge
the
2016
and
2020
elections
were
famous
for
the
failure
of
most
published
models
often
attributed
to
systematic
non
response
bias
in
polls
a
liquid
prediction
market
would
create
an
incentive
for
trading
firms
to
develop
solutions
to
these
hard
issues
in
order
to
make
more
money
fortunately
there
are
substantial
positive
externalities
to
these
investments
learning
how
better
to
model
poll
and
understand
the
population
would
help
policymakers
better
understand
their
constituents
so
they
can
figure
out
what
they
actually
want
voting
is
a
noisy
signal
of
preferences
the
financial
incentive
to
create
models
to
discern
voter
intentions
could
thus
make
our
democracy
even
more
responsive
the
demand
for
accurate
information
surrounding

is
enormous

the

indeed
hanson
and
oprea
found
one
major
reason
why
political
contracts
are
resistant
to
manipulation
attempts
is
that
any
attempt
to
manipulate
prices
induces
informed
counter
parties
to
enter
on
the
other
side
of
the
market
in
fact
the
greater
the
attempts
to
jack
up
one
side
prices
the
greater
the
returns
to
becoming
an
informed

as
university
of

economist
justin

and
dartmouth

eric
zitzewitz
wrote
regarding
previous
political
contracts
none
of
these
attempts
at

had
a
discernible
effect
on

except
during
a
short
transition
phase
this
finding
was
also
noted
by

could
the

facilitate
violations
of

otherwise
undermine
federal
campaign

laws

for

could
the

make
it
easier
to
sidestep
prohibitions
governing

between
candidate
campaign
committees
and
political

committees
no
the
concerns
this
question
raises
are
completely
unrelated
to
the

function

it
would
not

or

at
all
the
ability

the
implication
is
that
they
could
do
so
more
easily
by
providing
an
accurate
picture
of
the
state
of
the
race
then
public
polling
would
also
help
such
parties
sidestep
federal
law
a
plainly
untenable
proposition
as
described
earlier
it
is
not
plausible
for
any
actor
to
try
and
create
momentum
for
their
party
by
buying
up
one
side
shares
one
may
also
imagine
that
a
coordinated
group
of
individuals
may
conspire
to
manipulate
market
prices
to
give
the
false
impression
of

momentum
thus
potentially
harming
the
democratic
process
this
concern
has
been
tested
several
times
by
researchers
with
all
attempts
failing
koleman
and
strumpf
in

found
that

were
capable
of
sustaining
anything
more

do
the
contracts
present
any
special
considerations
with
respect
to
susceptibility
to
manipulation
or
surveillance
requirements
as
discussed
at
length
in
other
parts
of
this
letter
kalshi
contract
is
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
and
is
outright
less
susceptible
than
other
commodity
futures
contracts
kalshi
engages
in
extensive
market
surveillance
and
employs
know
your
customer
authorization
to
prevent
manipulation
in
compliance
with
the
core
principles
accordingly
we
believe
the
contemplated
measures
combined
with
kalshi
robust
market
surveillance
program
and
dedicated
technology
are
appropriately
calibrated
to
address
the
particular
risks
associated
with
these
particular
contracts
kalshi
rules
also
prohibit
trading
on
non
public
material
information
as
with
other
contracts
that
deal
with
publicly
important
information
such
as
on
the
monetary
policy
decisions
of
the
federal
reserve
the
integrity
of
the
decision
making

by
the
federal
open
market
committee
has
not
been
eroded
despite
contracts
that
trade
enormous
volumes
on
their
impact
this
is
no
different
for
these
contracts
kalshi
employs
know
your
customer
authorization
and
would
prevent
trading
by
politically
exposed
persons
including
campaigns
and
pacs
as
well
as
operator
close
associates
and
family
it
also
has
identified
a
long
list
of
political
actors
who
are
specifically
prohibited
from
trading
regarding
informational
advantages
of
market
participants
and
private
polling
a
privately
commissioned
poll
is
not
materially
non
public
information
any
market
actor
can
employ
similar
research
strategies
in
many
other
markets
every
market
has
a
discrepancy
between
its
trading
members
resources
for
example
hedge
funds
have
access
to
bloomberg
terminals
that
retail
investors
ca
afford
market
participants
have
a
financial
incentive
to
gain
access
to
better
information
entire
teams
of
meteorologists
are
hired
to
accurately
predict
agricultural
futures
prices
as
then
commissioner
quintenz
explained
the
goal
of
financial
markets
is
not
to
protect
or
shelter
the
less
informed
rather
the
market
incentivizes
being
informed
and
executing
on
that
knowledge
in
other
words
market
efficiencies
are
earned
they
are
created
through
research
investment
and
intellectual
property
148
this
is
a
benefit
of
listing
a
market
not
a
harm
it
results
in
more
accurate
pricing
for
the
market
the
benefits
of
which
are
discussed
in
detail
in
the
questions
regarding
public
interest
further
there
are
robust
protections
against
manipulation
the
exchange
has
rules
that
prohibit
manipulative
trading
and
the
exchange
performs
surveillance
to
detect
manipulation
this
serves
as
a
deterrent
to
attempts
to
manipulate
the
market
via
manipulative
trading
in
addition
the
exchange
rules
also
prohibit
trading
on
non
public
information

the

with

in

as

the

will
be
surveilling
its
market
for
any
sign
of

that
is
indicative
of
manipulative
or

behavior
the

will
have
all
of
the
necessary
data

as
discussed
at

earlier
in
this

and
in
kalshi

filing
american
elections
are
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
in
fact
manipulation
of
which
party
controls
the
congress
has
never
occurred
this
is
in
contrast
to
existing
markets
that
the
cftc
regulates
indeed
the
cftc
has
brought
numerous
enforcement
actions
against
market
participants
who
either
manipulated
or
attempted
to
manipulate
markets
in
oil
precious
metals
cattle
and
other
commodity
spot
and
futures
markets
the
commission
regularly
brings
almost
a
hundred
enforcement
actions
per
year
and
orders
billions
in
monetary
relief
then
of
course
there
are
digital
asset
markets
where
the
commission
has
brought
dozens
of
actions
in
an
incredibly
short
time
contrast
that
with
elections
where
election
or
voter
fraud
is
extremely
rare
and
never
succeeds
at
flipping
the
outcome
of
which
party
controls
congress
even
in
cases
where
election
manipulation
has
been
attempted
it
has
only
succeeded
in
affecting
extremely
small
local
elections
any
attempt
to
manipulate
the
contract
would
most
certainly
involve
a
high
degree
of
speculation
the
contract
is
in
regard
to
the
sum
of
hundreds
of
elections
it
is
not
even
possible
to
determine
which
elections
will
be
the
closest
and
thus
easiest
to
affect
in
advance
even
if
some
races
are
understood
to
be
more
close
than
others
as
detailed
in
appendix
f
a
large
scale
conspiracy
to
coerce
many
individuals
to
vote
a
particular
way
across
many
different
jurisdictions
without
being
detected
a
fraud
of
sufficient
size
would
mean
that
this
fraud
is
no
ocean
8
or
even
ocean
11
you
be
looking
at
well
into
the
hundreds
if
not
hundreds
of
thousands
manipulation
of
polling
machines
themselves
is
equally
quixotic
taken
all
in
all
it
is
very
unlikely
that
a
fraud
pertaining
to
this
contract
will
be
attempted
and
considerably
less
likely
than
in
other
areas
that
fall
under
the
commission
enforcement
authority
critically
there
are
already
enormous
stakes
in
elections
creating
incentives
for
outcome
manipulation
this
contract
will
not
change
that
fact
as
discussed
in
extensive
detail
in
appendix
b
in
the
public
comments
and
to
anyone
involved
in
industry
elections
move
prices
and
it
is
specious
to
presume
that
they
do
not
wall
street
firms
and
global
finance
all
trade
elections
the
contract
before
the
commission
is
not
novel
in
that
regard
rather
it
is
a
more
efficient
instrument
than
what
firms
currently
use
to
take
positions
on
elections
19
what
is
the
price
forming
information
for
these
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
if
the
price
forming
information
includes
polling
and
other
election
prediction
information
is
that
information
regulated
how
does
the
price
forming
information
compare
to
informational
sources
government
issued
crop
forecasts
weather
forecasts
federal
government
economic
data
market
derived
supply
and
demand
metrics
for
commodities
market
based
interest
rate
curves
etc
that
are
generally
used
for
pricing
commodity
derivative
products
within
the
commission
jurisdiction
there
is
a
plethora
of
information
used
by
the
public
and
market
participants
to
help
calculate
the
probability
that
a
given
party
will
take
control
of
congress
some
of
these
are
regulated
federal
government
economic
data
but
some
are
not
polls
that
being
said
there
is
no
requirement
that
such
information
be
regulated
nor
is
it
clear
that
regulated
information
is
the
primary
source
of
pricing
information
for
many
commodity
futures
contracts
compared
to
private
market
forecasts
and
data
as
discussed
at
other
points
in
this
response
demand
for
accurate
information
on
election
probabilities
is
in
incredibly
high
demand
by
the
public
and
as
a
result
there
is
a
large
competitive
market
for
such
content
with
regard
to
whether
polling
would
become
regulated
the
answer
is
not
any
more
or
any
less
than
any
of
the
other
information
that
goes
into
pricing
any
commodity
20
should
and
if
so
how
would
the
registered
entity
listing
the
contracts
take
steps
to
address
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involving
the
price
forming
information
for
the
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
the
exchange
has
already
taken
great
steps
to
prevent
and
address
manipulative
behavior
as
in
some
of
the
prior
questions
it
seems
odd
for
the
commission
to
request
only
the
public
input
in
this
regard
but
has
not
discussed
this
with
kalshi
regardless
the
exchange
has
numerous
safeguards
in
place
to
prevent
manipulation
additionally
the
exchange
notes
that
in
particular
concerns
regarding
manipulating
this
contract
are
broadly
unlikely
the
market
for
credible
information
on
elections
and
their
probabilities
is
very
competitive
and
false
information
is
equally
as
likely
to
impact
kalshi
market
as
reports
regarding
the
production
of
oil
do
for
oil
futures
should
false
information
be
reported
the
returns
from
being
an
informed
trader
who
could
sniff
out
so
much
information
would
grow
commensurately
that
being
said
the
exchange
nonetheless
is
extremely
focused
on
making
sure
that
such
concerns
would
not
affect
the
market
for
example
it
has
gated
out
polling
organizations
and
employees
thereof
from
trading
kalshi
engages
in
extensive
market
surveillance
and
employs
know
your
customer
authorization
to

with

the

despite

this
is
no
different
it
is
also
important
to
note
what
the
correct
legal
standard
is
which
is
not
free
from
attempted
manipulation
indeed
one
need
only
to
peruse
the
annals
of
the
cftc
enforcement
actions
to
find
many
contracts
that
were
manipulated
libor
or
the
subject
of
an
attempted
manipulation
these
event
contracts
such
as
oil
contracts
interest
rate
swaps
etc
are
significantly
more
likely
and
susceptible
to
be
manipulated
than
this
contract
indeed
the
fact
that
a
contract
like
this
on
a
regulated
market
is
so
unlikely
to
be
manipulated
successfully
is
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
public
is
so
keen
on
seeing
the
data
from
the
market
which
will
be
far
more
reliable
than
many
other
data
sources
currently
available
21
do
kalshi
limitations
on
market
participation
affect
the
susceptibility
of
the
contracts
markets
for
the
contracts
to
manipulation
do
the
limitations
affect
the
extent
to
which
these
markets
could
be
used
to
influence
perception
of
a
political
party
or

or
otherwise
be

in

are
the
limitations

few
to
no
parties
have
access
to
material
insider
information
on
the
contract
outcome
any
potential
information
an
actor
could
have
is
highly
unlikely
to
be
material
regarding
the
outcome
of
in
total
several
hundred
congressional
races
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
argument
that
congressional
control
can
come
down
to
the
outcome
of
a
handful
of
races
and
some
races
can
be
decided
by
a
margin
of
several
thousand
hundred
or
even
individual
votes
has
little
to
no
bearing
on
the
contract
susceptibility
to
manipulation
the
margin
of
victory
before
an
election
is
unknown
if
a
nefarious
actor
attempted
to
manipulate
the
election
in
order
to
manipulate
the
contract
which
is
what
the
cftc
is
asking
in
this
question
the
actor
would
not
know
beforehand
what
the
margin
of
victory
would
be
that
nefarious
actor
would
have
to
assess
the
size
of
the
electorate
which
is
in
every
instance
going
to
be
large
accordingly
it
is
hard
to
conceive
of
the
definitive
piece
of
material
non
public
information
that
will
swing
the
outcome
of
the
contract
however
like
all
contracts
on
kalshi
there
is
a
prohibition
to
trade
on
material
nonpublic
information
this
contract
is
no
different
in
that
regard
in
response
to
various
indications
from
the
commission
however
the
exchange
adopted
contract
specific
rules
for
this
contract
to
gate
out
certain
people
who
would
be
more
likely
to
have
information
that
could
be
considered
material
nonpublic
information
this
gating
itself
is
the
proverbial
safeguard
on
a
safeguard
as
in
other
questions
kalshi
notes
the
incongruity
of
asking
the
public
for
input
on
how
kalshi
will
enforce
a
rule
without
having
asked
kalshi
regardless
this
rule
is
enforceable
22
should
the
commission
be
responsible
for
surveilling
and
enforcing
against
possible
manipulative
false
reporting
activity
involving
the
price
forming
information
for
the
contracts
while
the
contracts
are
trading
it
should
be
responsible
for
surveilling
and
enforcing
against
manipulative
and
false
reporting
activity
while
the
contracts
were
live
as
much
as
it
is
responsible
for
doing
so
with
other
listed
contracts
no
more
no
less
further
the
exchange
notes
that
one
of
the
benefits
of
having
this
activity
on
a
regulated
exchange
is
that
the
commission
will
for
the
first
time
gain
insight
into
the
amount
and
level
of
activity
of
trading
on
congressional
control
currently
if
for
example
congress
would
invite
the
cftc
to
the
hill
and
ask
the
cftc
to
describe
the
current
financial
activity
on
congressional
control
the
cftc
will
have
nothing
to
say
beyond
there
is
activity
some
on
otc
some
on
unregulated
markets
some
overseas
when
pressed
for
details
on
who
is
participating
the
cftc
will
have
to
confess
its
utter
ignorance
however
if
the
contract
were
to
trade
on
regulated
exchanges
the
cftc
will
not
only
know
precisely
what
positions
are
being
taken
on
the
regulated
markets
they
will
know
who
is
taking
them
23
could
trading
in
the
markets
for
the
contracts
obligate
the
commission
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
electoral
process
or
political
fundraising
if
so
is
this
an
appropriate
role
for
the
commission
there
is
no
reason
for
the
commission
to
believe
it
will
be
responsible
for
policing
attempts
at
or
successful
election
fraud
no
more
and
no
less
than
the
cftc
is
responsible
for
any
other
type
of
underlying
fraud
that
has
impacts
on
a
contract
earlier
this
year
there
were
two
individuals
who
were
arrested
for
attempting
to
destroy
power
stations
with
the
ultimate
goal
of
destroying
the
city
of
baltimore
if
successful
the
sabotage
would
have
impacted
electricity
prices
significantly
is
the
cftc
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
prosecution
of
these
two
individuals
is
the
cftc
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
protecting
of
america
power
grid
impacts
the
prices
of
global
oil
including
the
futures
markets
that
the
cftc
regulates
is
the
cftc
therefore
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
meetings
is
the
cftc
obligated
to
investigate
or
otherwise
become
involved
in
the
determination
of
corporate
dividends
that
underlie
the
cme
contract
the
answer
to
all
of
these
is
that
the
cftc
will
get
involved
to
the
extent
that
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
administer
and
enforce
the
cea
the
cftc
does
not
in
any
of
these
cases
assume
the
role
of
the
cop
on
the
beat
this
application
here
is
no
different
election
manipulation
is
a
crime
there
are
law
enforcement
agencies
who
police
elections
and
elections
are
policed
much
more
effectively
than
other
markets
that
have
cftc
derivative
products
trading
on
them
the
commission
is
not
the
only
cop
on
the
beat
with
regard
to
election
fraud
elections
unlike
many
other
reference
markets
or
events
that
have
cftc
derivatives
trading
on
them
are
governed
by
multiple
law
enforcement
agencies
whose
very
existence
is
to
prevent
and
detect
election
manipulation
and
fraud
this
includes
the
federal
election
commission
the
federal
department
of
justice
state
election
commissions
state
secretaries
of
state
and
state
ethics
commissions
history
has
shown
that
these
agencies
are
very
good
at
their
job
the
other
day
the
cftc
brought
an
enforcement
charge
against
alexander
mashinsky
and
celsius
network
llc
where
the
cftc
acknowledged
the
role
that
was
played
by
both
the
sec
and
the
attorney
office
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
similarly
cody
easterday
committed
fraud
that
was
discovered
by
tyson
foods
and
prosecuted
by
the
department
of
justice
the
cftc
also
charged
easterday
presumably
after
cooperating
with
the
relevant
criminal
authorities
these
are
two
examples
of
many
the
cftc
is
well
versed
in
cooperating
with
the
relevant
law
enforcement
agencies
be
it
the
fbi
or
doj
or
any
other
relevant
federal
or
state
authority
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
cftc
would
somehow
lose
that
competency
in
this
case
24
what
other
factors
should
the
commission
consider
in
determining
whether
these
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
has
never
fully
defined
the
full
extent
of
the
factors
it
considers
under
the
public
interest
standard
in
section
even
the
nadex
order
admits
that
the
commission
can
consider
factors
other
than
the
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
is
not
an
expert
in
all
areas
such
as
election
law
or
integrity
voter
confidence
or
how
to
foster
democracy
and
the
commission
should
instead
focus
on
what
it
knows
the
value
of
a
contract
as
a
hedging
interest
and
the
value
of
a
contract
price
to
market
participants
as
we
noted
in
response
earlier
these
contracts
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
have
a
large
economic
purpose
would
serve
as
a
useful
tool
for
voters
the
media
and
the
public
that
would
fight
information
and
improve
election
integrity
we
note
that
the
evidence
supporting
the
contracts
is
wholly
consistent
with
the
stated
findings
and
purpose
of
the
cea
found
in
7
usc
5
the
contracts
provide
a
means
for
managing
and
assuming
price
risks
discovering
prices
or
disseminating
pricing
information
through
trading
in
liquid
fair
and
financially
secure
trading
facilities
7
usc
these
contracts
and
their
trading
on
kalshi
would
protect
all
market
participants
from
fraudulent
or
other
abusive
sales
practices
and
misuses
of
customer
assets
7
usc
finally
allowing
these
contracts
to
trade
on
a
cftc
regulated
dcm
would
promote
responsible
innovation
and
fair
competition
among
boards
of
trade
other
markets
and
market
participants
ibid
in
sum
these
contracts
are
consistent
with
the
cea
and
its
purposes
and
kalshi
has
shown
that
they
should
be
traded
on
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
with
all
of
the
protections
that
the
cea
makes
available
to
market
participants
the
commission
should
hold
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
it
no
economic
purpose
no
hedging
utility
no
price
basing
utility
meaning
it
has
no
effect
on
the
prices
of
other
commodities
assets
services
or
commodity
interests
which
must
therefore
include
affecting
the
probabilities
of
other
events
on
which
event
contracts
are
now
or
in
the
future
trading
has
no
forecasting
value
to
the
public
