regarding
the
kalshiex
proposed
congressional
control
contract
22
002
to
whom
it
may
concern
there
have
been
a
wide
range
of
comments
written
from
academic
financial
and
small
business
points
of
views
many
of
which
i
would
echo
it
is
self
evident
that
this
contract
on
congressional
control
can
and
will
be
used
for
hedging
in
various
industries
professions
that
are
sensitive
to
swings
in
political
sentiment
it
is
self
evident
that
this
market
would
serve
a
useful
economic
function
and
that
the
information
from
this
market
is
in
the
public
interest
i
therefore
think
that
this
market
should
be
approved
instead
of
rewriting
what
others
have
written
i
want
to
instead
compose
a
less
formalized
letter
from
the
perspective
of
someone
who
risks
money
on
politics
i
been
trading
political
and
events
markets
since
2007
as
my
principal
occupation
i
was
one
of
the
most
active
traders
on
intrade
and
also
on
predictit
the
only
exception
was
2013
2014
and
2015
after
intrade
had
been
shut
down
but
before
predictit
became
viable
during
that
time
i
traded
stocks
i
come
back
to
that
later
my
work
days
trading
political
events
are
largely
devoted
to
research
and
reading
i
sometimes
design
models
and
often
use
spreadsheets
i
talk
to
experts
and
frequently
consult
with
other
people
i
sometimes
endeavor
to
find
information
before
reporters
find
it
my
job
is
time
consuming
fun
hard
rewarding
taxing
exciting
and
perhaps
most
of
all
dynamic
what
it
definitely
is
not
is
random
or
speculative
and
i
cringe
if
someone
calls
it
gambling
trying
to
predict
what
people
are
going
to
do
in
politics
either
predicting
how
voters
are
going
to
vote
or
how
elected
officials
are
going
to
make
decisions
is
a
whole
lot
of
work
finally
it
is
not
luck
in
the
short
term
sometimes
it
is
but
not
over
the
long
run
i
have
been
able
to
consistently
make
a
living
doing
this
for
15
years
given
my
experience
in
this
field
i
wanted
to
share
some
thoughts
on
the
questions
posed
by
the
cftc
pricing
is
a
bulwark
against
misinformation
and
misleading
punditry
many
americans
are
in
news
silos
right
now
which
is
to
say
they
receive
news
from
one
perspective
or
silo
that
is
likely
delivering
that
news
in
a
biased
fashion
this
is
an
issue
that
social
media
companies
among
others
grapple
with
solving
the
problem
with
siloing
is
not
isolated
to
a
single
political
party
and
this
is
a
problem
that
is
becoming
more
prevalent
not
less
i
note
the
obvious
one
party
misinformation
is
undoubtedly
manifesting
itself
in
far
worse
and
more
obvious
ways
at
this
moment
but
misinformation
itself
is
not
a
phenomenon
of
just
one
side
of
the
aisle
further
to
that
point
a
lot
of
news
that
people
receive
is
in
the
form
of
punditry
by
experts
who
predict
what
will
happen
or
interpret
the
news
and
its
consequences
in
a
very
specific
way
markets
cut
through
punditry
and
biased
observations
and
offer
a
perspective
that
will
be
much
closer
to
the
truth
this
is
definitely
not
to
say
that
markets
are
perfect
but
only
that
they
are
clearly
better
than
the
alternative
of
punditry
dominated
coverage
and
in
my
opinion
these
markets
are
deeply
beneficial
as
an
arbiter
of
the
truth
in
a
world
where
the
consumption
of
news
is
becoming
more
biased
one
need
only
go
back
less
than
two
years
to
the
previous
election
where
the
pricing
of
donald
trump
to
become
the
next
president
was
still
around
10
for
months
after
he
was
declared
the
loser
of
the
race
in
that
time
he
mounted
various
legal
and
extralegal
challenges
to
the
outcome
and
spoke
openly
of
the
election
being
overturned
many
on
different
sides
of
the
aisle
saw
this
10
pricing
as
wildly
incorrect
for
very
different
reasons
some
thought
he
would
definitely
remain
president
near
100
and
others
thought
it
was
impossible
0
chance
the
market
pricing
of
10
while
definitely
imperfect
communicated
the
reality
better
than
the
two
silos
it
relayed
that
trump
was
strongly
disfavored
to
retain
the
presidency
while
also
communicating
to
everyone
that
the
possibility
of
a
successful
legal
or
extralegal
effort
to
retain
the
presidency
was
higher
than
0
pricing
on
an
event
of
that
magnitude
is
extremely
important
information
to
possess
for
business
and
for
the
general
public
market
pricing
information
that
is
so
important
we
can
not
afford
to
lose
it
cost
of
disallowing
the
markets
is
not
negligible
unregulated
political
betting
on
us
elections
by
us
persons
will
happen
it
is
the
reality
of
the
situation
if
kalshi
and
other
dcms
are
permitted
to
operate
a
market
on
congressional
control
much
of
the
political
event
trading
will
exit
unregulated
areas
and
enter
regulated
areas
under
the
auspices
of
the
cftc
new
market
participants
would
also
join
thus
making
the
pricing
far
more
robust
and
reliable
if
kalshi
and
other
dcms
are
not
permitted
and
given
the
recent
ejection
of
predictit
all
regulated
or
quasi
regulated
betting
on
future
elections
by
us
persons
will
cease
in
the
us
and
entirely
move
to
unregulated
and
foreign
housed
marketplaces
this
would
be
a
huge
step
backward
and
will
shove
pricing
on
important
events
that
greatly
impact
this
country
into
a
darker
area
with
less
oversight
academia
and
industry
will
be
less
likely
to
cite
the
market
prices
because
the
markets
will
have
far
fewer
people
participating
and
specifically
far
fewer
americans
this
means
less
knowledge
of
market
pricing
and
a
large
increase
in
uncertainty
and
into
that
absence
of
certainty
creeps
in
those
biased
sources
of
news
and
information
elections
markets
have
existed
in
the
us
since
1992
without
incident
the
cftc
to
my
knowledge
has
issued
no
action
letters
to
three
entities
since
1992
the
iowa
electronic
markets
iem
intrade
and
predictit
there
has
never
been
any
state
level
action
against
these
three
entities
nor
has
there
been
to
my
knowledge
any
interest
in
taking
action
against
these
entities
by
states
intrade
operated
without
incident
on
its
election
specific
markets
and
to
my
knowledge
was
shut
down
for
reasons
unrelated
to
elections
predictit
has
operated
without
incident
on
its
election
specific
markets
it
unclear
why
the
cftc
is
shutting
down
the
site
although
i
strongly
suspect
it
is
wholly
unrelated
to
the
actual
elections
trading
iem
to
my
knowledge
has
had
no
incidents
since
inception
all
of
this
is
to
say
that
there
has
been
trading
in
these
markets
for
30
years
with
a
plethora
of
news
stories
academic
study
and
usage
of
attention
to
these
markets
and
during
those
30
years
the
case
for
a
regulated
market
on
elections
has
only
been
strengthened
these
markets
were
not
misused
these
markets
provided
valuable
information
and
these
markets
were
not
targeted
by
states
with
the
only
federal
action
against
them
being
for
reasons
that
were
unrelated
to
election
markets
happened
in
west
virginia
is
not
an
analogue
a
brief
aside
here
a
previous
letter
cited
west
virginia
shutdown
of
election
betting
lines
this
happened
after
betting
lines
were
posted
by
fanduel
sportsbook
with
permission
of
the
west
virginia
lottery
the
west
virginia
lottery
changed
their
mind
on
the
following
day
and
the
lines
were
removed
within
24
hours
there
is
a
deep
distinction
between
betting
lines
from
a
company
under
a
sports
betting
license
with
the
odds
placed
right
alongside
odds
for
sports
games
and
a
peer
to
peer
cftc
permitted
dcm
with
an
open
order
book
and
no
sports
betting
in
sight
the
west
virginia
lottery
would
not
be
tasked
with
overseeing
or
at
all
involved
with
kalshi
and
other
dcms
a
platform
like
iem
intrade
predictit
or
hypothetically
kalshi
will
be
sought
out
specifically
by
a
user
in
order
to
make
predictions
on
elections
it
would
be
wholly
distinct
from
sports
betting
markets
have
existed
in
other
countries
without
incident
for
decades
actions
taken
by
foreign
countries
may
not
be
relevant
to
the
cftc
decision
but
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
the
us
would
not
be
trailblazing
a
controversial
area
of
prediction
markets
trading
election
outcomes
has
been
robust
in
other
countries
for
decades
in
the
uk
for
instance
it
is
commonplace
and
not
controversial
i
was
standing
outside
of
westminster
this
summer
while
the
tory
party
was
voting
on
its
new
leader
and
a
tv
correspondent
had
the
odds
right
next
to
him
of
rishi
sunak
liz
truss
etc
while
he
was
presenting
it
is
neither
harmful
nor
controversial
to
inform
the
public
of
who
is
likely
to
lead
the
country
next
referring
back
to
my
discussion
of
news
silos
i
think
the
brexit
market
pricing
in
particular
cut
through
the
ability
of
the
two
sides
of
that
extremely
contentious
debate
to
portray
the
outcome
in
a
way
that
deviated
significantly
from
reality
the
brexit
market
was
also
of
very
strong
salience
to
industries
that
were
sensitive
to
whether
the
uk
remained
in
the
european
union
generally
speaking
having
visibility
to
the
market
likelihood
of
an
event
with
far
reaching
consequences
and
the
ability
to
hedge
that
risk
if
necessary
are
both
important
the
mid
1800s
to
around
1940
election
betting
was
commonplace
within
the
us
i
would
highlight
two
passages
from
this
paper
on
historical
betting
markets
in
the
us
wagering
on
presidential
elections
has
a
long
tradition
in
the
united
states
with
large
and
often
well
organized
markets
operating
for
over
three
quarters
of
a
century
before
world
war
ii
the
resulting
betting
odds
proved
remarkably
prescient
and
almost
always
correctly
predicted
election
outcomes
well
in
advance
despite
the
absence
of
scientific
polls
this
historical
experience
suggests
a
promising
role
for
other
prediction
markets
our
analysis
complements
a
substantial
body
of
experimental
research
that
has
hinted
that
asset
markets
can
successfully
aggregate
information
although
large
sums
of
money
were
at
stake
in
the
historical
presidential
betting
markets
we
are
not
aware
of
any
evidence
that
the
political
process
was
seriously
corrupted
by
the
presence
of
a
wagering
market
this
matches
my
knowledge
and
experience
of
modern
elections
markets
and
highlights
the
two
most
important
points
1
the
information
that
the
markets
provide
is
valuable
and
2
there
exists
no
evidence
of
a
connection
between
people
predicting
elections
and
corrupt
outcomes
hedgers
already
use
imperfect
proxies
for
election
markets
people
already
crudely
event
trade
with
existing
financial
instruments
there
are
a
large
number
of
articles
written
before
elections
on
what
stocks
you
should
buy
if
you
think
the
republicans
or
democrats
are
going
to
win
for
instance
this
is
the
top
result
of
an
internet
search
on
stocks
to
buy
in
the
2020
election
a
cfa
writing
in
kiplinger
on
the
13
best
stocks
to
buy
if
president
donald
trump
wins
re
election
this
is
one
example
of
many
articles
that
dole
out
advice
on
how
to
bet
on
the
next
election
through
stocks
i
sure
there
will
be
more
articles
before
the
2022
midterm
elections
trading
corporate
stocks
and
derivatives
thereof
is
just
one
way
to
predict
an
event
other
options
include
foreign
exchange
commodities
sovereign
debt
and
sophisticated
instruments
like
credit
default
swaps
why
is
this
type
of
trading
done
before
an
event
it
of
high
importance
of
high
interest
and
the
ramifications
can
be
quite
large
the
profits
can
be
as
well
i
personally
have
used
stock
and
derivatives
trading
as
a
proxy
for
events
trading
including
trades
in
puts
when
i
was
researching
covid
in
early
2020
trades
in
for
profit
prison
companies
as
a
proxy
for
political
control
trades
in
solar
companies
as
a
proxy
for
political
control
and
trades
in
coal
companies
as
a
proxy
for
political
control
but
these
are
imperfect
ways
to
trade
the
underlying
events
i
could
be
completely
correct
about
a
certain
party
taking
power
and
the
ramifications
on
an
industry
but
the
specific
company
could
announce
it
was
under
investigation
for
some
unrelated
transgression
that
i
can
never
anticipate
or
the
trade
could
be
so
crowded
with
other
people
with
the
exact
same
thesis
that
everyone
is
trying
to
exit
at
the
same
time
after
it
happens
and
the
trade
backfires
trading
the
actual
event
contract
is
always
going
to
be
the
purest
and
best
method
for
trading
an
event
rather
than
a
proxy
i
earlier
mentioned
that
i
briefly
traded
stocks
as
my
occupation
the
reason
i
brought
that
up
is
because
i
profited
by
investing
in
companies
with
a
well
researched
thesis
using
the
same
principles
as
predicting
elections
but
i
also
found
that
stocks
were
far
more
random
and
chance
based
than
participating
in
a
market
on
elections
as
mentioned
the
stocks
can
more
easily
succumb
to
the
vagaries
of
random
chance
and
general
market
sentiment
things
you
had
not
anticipated
and
could
not
anticipate
your
thesis
could
be
correct
but
you
could
still
easily
lose
money
because
of
how
interwoven
the
company
is
with
other
variables
hence
the
reason
that
i
went
back
to
elections
in
2016
when
predictit
became
viable
it
is
far
less
common
in
events
trading
to
have
a
correct
thesis
and
also
lose
money
if
this
type
of
events
oriented
trading
is
already
done
in
the
financial
sector
using
legitimate
but
crude
proxies
there
is
even
more
reason
to
bring
a
regulated
market
to
the
equation
it
would
offer
the
individuals
and
companies
conducting
these
trades
a
straightforward
way
to
make
similar
predictions
of
high
importance
events
with
a
noteworthy
distinction
lower
variance
and
randomness
of
sec
filings
from
companies
mention
the
risks
of
politics
in
their
disclosures
in
the
first
paragraph
of
this
letter
i
said
it
was
self
evident
that
hedging
is
possible
with
these
event
contracts
i
wanted
to
highlight
something
that
i
have
not
seen
mentioned
by
commenters
yet
publicly
traded
corporations
are
required
to
file
quarterly
and
annual
disclosures
of
risks
to
their
businesses
countless
numbers
i
am
going
to
conservatively
classify
it
as
hundreds
because
that
is
how
many
i
personally
read
over
the
years
of
these
financial
disclosures
include
risks
specifically
related
to
politics
and
changes
in
laws
and
regulations
commensurate
with
changes
in
political
power
i
entered
a
random
company
into
edgar
paypal
in
paypal
most
recent
10
q
filed
with
the
sec
this
is
one
of
the
most
prominent
risks
listed
our
business
is
subject
to
complex
and
changing
laws
rules
regulations
policies
and
legal
interpretations
in
the
markets
in
which
we
offer
services
directly
or
through
partners
including
but
not
limited
to
those
governing
banking
credit
deposit
taking
this
is
just
one
example
many
many
industries
are
sensitive
to
changes
in
political
power
to
varying
degrees
some
industries
like
energy
are
extremely
sensitive
to
put
a
finer
point
on
it
the
department
of
energy
lists
the
energy
sector
as
employing
million
people
in
2021
that
5
of
the
nation
workforce
employed
in
an
industry
that
is
currently
very
sensitive
to
political
control
being
able
to
hedge
is
both
important
and
obvious
what
may
be
less
obvious
is
that
robust
regulated
markets
on
something
like
congressional
control
will
provide
these
companies
and
individuals
within
those
fields
the
ability
to
quantify
those
risks
the
contours
of
risk
are
often
a
blind
spot
for
many
companies
companies
can
know
the
risk
exists
but
not
how
to
measure
it
underestimating
or
overestimating
the
risk
could
have
costly
consequences
market
pricing
helps
to
shine
a
light
on
political
risk
and
demystify
it
already
use
legitimate
financial
instruments
for
speculation
decisions
should
not
be
made
based
on
whether
some
people
could
use
a
market
for
troublesome
uses
like
speculation
or
gambling
because
that
is
true
for
almost
all
legitimate
financial
instruments
it
is
not
logical
to
shut
down
the
stock
and
options
market
to
the
public
in
order
to
prevent
wallstreetbets
users
from
making
ridiculous
highly
leveraged
bets
in
perfectly
legitimate
financial
instruments
equity
trading
and
derivatives
trading
are
used
for
their
intended
purpose
by
plenty
of
people
subsets
of
traders
using
financial
instruments
for
speculation
or
gambling
does
not
obviate
the
need
for
the
rest
of
the
participants
to
use
them
more
generally
i
have
found
that
the
argument
that
people
will
gamble
on
xyz
in
relation
to
election
markets
to
be
a
red
herring
if
people
want
to
gamble
they
are
not
bereft
of
choices
the
options
are
plentiful
in
reality
from
my
experience
the
vast
majority
of
users
of
intrade
and
predictit
were
are
trying
to
make
a
smart
prediction
risking
their
own
money
to
make
a
profit
this
is
exactly
what
constitutes
a
healthy
market
i
suspect
kalshi
and
other
dcms
would
likewise
see
primarily
legitimate
market
participants
and
very
few
gamblers
i
hope
my
thoughts
have
been
worthwhile
for
anyone
who
reads
them
and
i
look
forward
to
the
forthcoming
decision
kind
