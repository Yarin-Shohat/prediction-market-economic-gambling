my
name
is
seth
weinstein
i
am
a
private
angel
investor
in
more
than
25
seed
stage
startups
one
of
those
investments
includes
kalshi
i
formerly
worked
as
a
managing
director
and
ceo
of
morgan
stanley
fund
services
kalshi
congressional
control
event
contract
promotes
the
public
interest
and
should
be
accepted
i
shall
address
several
questions
that
the
cftc
has
put
forward
question
6
do
the
contracts
serve
a
hedging
function
are
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
based
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedged
directly
by
the
contracts
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrates
the
hedging
utility
of
the
contracts
these
contracts
indisputably
serve
a
hedging
function
as
an
investor
i
have
heard
countless
pitches
from
would
be
businesses
that
face
risks
from
changes
in
federal
policy
some
of
these
companies
are
financial
firms
whose
entire
business
model
could
be
undone
by
a
change
in
financial
regulation
others
are
more
capital
intensive
industries
whose
efforts
might
be
set
back
years
by
changes
in
the
tax
code
or
other
policy
the
policy
risks
that
these
companies
face
are
no
different
from
a
business
standpoint
than
physical
risks
like
natural
disasters
both
require
proper
hedging
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
are
sufficiently
predictable
such
that
the
contract
can
be
used
for
hedging
purposes
it
is
somewhat
surprising
to
hear
the
cftc
an
arm
of
the
federal
government
query
whether
the
government
matters
enough
that
people
might
be
affected
by
it
if
the
consequences
of
congressional
control
were
so
unpredictable
why
would
people
vote
the
fact
is
that
congressional
parties
put
out
mountains
of
white
papers
speeches
policy
documents
and
proposals
that
make
it
clear
what
their
priorities
are
moreover
this
question
misunderstands
how
congress
impacts
many
businesses
suppose
a
finance
critical
congress
came
into
power
one
may
argue
that
one
does
not
know
for
certain
that
this
congress
will
pass
a
bill
that
tightens
regulations
and
this
is
true
but
it
does
not
follow
from
that
statement
that
the
firm
need
not
hedge
any
competent
bank
venture
capital
firm
or
investor
thinking
about
investing
in
a
finance
firm
will
be
worried
that
the
congress
might
pass
such
a
bill
and
think
twice
before
lending
money
or
investing
in
the
company
they
might
charge
a
higher
interest
rate
or
demand
more
equity
in
exchange
for
taking
on
the
greater
risk
since
financial
markets
are
forward
looking
the
impacts
of
congressional
control
manifest
far
before
the
bill
actually
becomes
law
and
indeed
even
prior
to
the
new
congress
being
sworn
in
as
a
result
even
though
it
is
true
that
congressional
policy
outcomes
are
sufficiently
predictable
that
the
contract
can
be
used
for
hedging
that
argument
is
not
even
necessary
the
directional
economic
impact
for
specific
firms
can
be
known
even
without
knowing
the
policy
outcomes
question
7
are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
existing
derivative
products
are
useful
but
they
can
not
fully
hedge
this
risk
for
example
in
the
above
example
about
an
early
stage
financial
firm
the
concern
is
that
their
loan
payments
might
rise
due
to
expectations
of
greater
policy
risk
or
the
terms
they
are
offered
on
their
term
sheet
might
get
worse
one
may
wonder
why
they
could
not
buy
a
derivative
product
that
pays
out
if
interest
rate
rises
but
the
issue
is
that
in
this
example
the
economy
wide
interest
rate
is
not
rising
it
just
rising
for
specific
firms
who
face
elevated
risks
a
product
based
on
benchmark
interest
rates
simply
does
not
cover
increases
in
risk
premia
just
increases
in
the
risk
free
interest
rate
but
the
most
substantial
issue
is
why
does
it
matter
if
the
economic
risk
is
unique
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
nor
in
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
authorizes
the
cftc
to
perform
a
uniqueness
test
if
anything
a
uniqueness
test
would
be
highly
anticompetitive
as
it
would
prohibit
any
challenger
from
offering
a
product
that
is
already
being
offered
by
an
incumbent
firm
it
also
would
stifle
innovation
since
it
would
prohibit
a
challenger
from
offering
a
product
that
improves
upon
any
existing
product
because
it
would
be
duplicating
the
economic
risk
of
the
incumbent
in
short
not
only
are
these
risks
unique
but
the
requirement
to
prove
uniqueness
has
no
legal
basis
and
if
implemented
would
compromise
the
public
interest
10
should
the
commission
consider
the
contract
design
and
payout
when
trying
to
assess
the
economic
utility
of
the
contract
for
example
are
binary
contracts
useful
for
hedging
nonbinary
economic
events
the
commission
should
not
consider
design
and
payout
the
market
should
there
is
no
basis
in
the
regulations
or
the
cea
for
such
an
analysis
if
a
contract
design
is
a
poor
fit
for
hedging
then
the
contract
will
get
less
volume
and
the
exchange
will
suffer
financially
they
will
then
iterate
and
improve
upon
the
contract
until
it
a
better
fit
this
is
how
a
market
should
function
moreover
the
commission
who
does
not
speak
to
potential
customers
daily
like
an
exchange
does
is
not
in
an
epistemically
strong
position
to
evaluate
a
contract
design
and
payout
they
should
not
replace
the
market
judgment
with
their
own
nevertheless
binary
contracts
are
useful
for
hedging
nonbinary
economic
events
all
economic
events
have
a
range
of
outcomes
for
any
individual
hedging
party
and
yet
the
cftc
has
allowed
several
exchanges
including
kalshi
nadex
and
the
chicago
mercantile
exchange
to
list
binary
contracts
any
scalar
risk
can
be
decomposed
into
a
series
of
binary
risks
this
question
fits
into
a
broader
theme
with
many
of
the
cftc
questions
it
supposes
the
existence
of
some
form
of
test
that
the
regulations
and
cea
do
not
allow
and
even
though
kalshi
contract
consistently
passes
these
tests
even
the
consideration
of
these
factors
should
be
a
cause
for
concern
about
the
commission
level
of
arbitrariness
and
caprice
11
do
the
contracts
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
yes
indeed
as
someone
who
has
spent
my
career
on
wall
street
i
can
say
with
confidence
that
political
control
matters
for
accurately
pricing
commodities
and
other
financial
assets
as
mentioned
previously
financial
markets
especially
futures
markets
and
equity
markets
are
forward
looking
futures
markets
for
instance
consider
the
expectation
of
the
future
spot
price
when
determining
the
price
to
pay
for
the
future
today
if
a
new
congress
comes
into
power
that
changes
future
expectations
of
supply
and
demand
affecting
the
expectation
of
the
future
price
so
it
will
be
capitalized
into
today
prices
for
instance
this
paper
using
data
from
jim
jeffords
unexpected
party
switch
found
effects
of
changes
in
congressional
control
on
the
stock
price
of
many
firms
so
not
only
could
estimates
of
the
probability
of
a
given
party
winning
serve
a
price
basing
function
they
already
are
these
contracts
would
merely
improve
that
price
discovery
by
providing
a
more
accurate
market
driven
datapoint
