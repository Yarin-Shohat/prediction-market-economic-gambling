ice
recognizes
the
cftc

act
cea
directs
the
commission
with
promoting
responsible
innovation
and
fair
competition
among
market
participants
in
promulgating
the
cftc
mission
congress
was
careful
to
ensure
that
innovation
is
advanced
responsibly
and
does
not
jeopardize
the
integrity
or
financial
stability
of
the
markets
or
customer
protections
when
listing

regulated
exchanges
must
determine
that
new

and
its
mission
to
advance
the
national
public

risks
discovering
prices
or
disseminating
pricing
information
through
trading
in
liquid
fair
and
financially
secure
trading
facilities
to
that
end
it
is
crucial
that
the
cftc
establish
a
transparent
accountable
and
consistent
process
for
new
products
so
that
regulated
exchanges
have
certainty
regarding
regulatory
requirements
and
exchanges
can
continue
to
innovate
consistent
with
the
goal
of

of
the
commission
rules
permit
a
designated
contract
market
or
swaps
execution
facility
to
list
a
new
contract
by
self
certification
section
of
the
cea
provides
a
narrow
exception
under
which
the
cftc
may
determine
that
contracts
based
on
the
occurrence
of
an
event
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
contracts
involve

activity
that

or
vi
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
was
added
to
the
cea
in
2010
by
the
dodd
frank
act
and
permits
the
commission
to
prohibit
an
event
contract
from
being
listed
for
trading
on
an
exchange
if
1
the
contract
involves
one
of
five
enumerated
activities
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
and
2
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
also
provides
that
the
commission
may
determine
by
rule
or
regulation
that
an
event
contract
involves
other
similar
activity
to
the
five
enumerated
activities
which
would
subject
event
contracts
involving
that
similar
activity
to
the
contrary
to
the
public
interest
standard
a
contract
that
is
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
may
not
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
the
proposal
would
revise
existing
rule
to
track
the
statutory
language
in
cea
section
and
would
categorically
prohibit
the
listing
for
trading
or
clearing
of
contracts
in
excluded
commodities
involving
one
of
the
categories
of
activity
enumerated
above
the
proposal
would
further
define
the
enumerated
activity
of
gaming
to
include
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
on
i
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
ii
the
outcome
of
an
awards
contest
iii
the
outcome
of
a
game
in
which
one
or
more
athletes
compete
or
iv
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
in
ice
view
the
proposed
categorical
prohibition
of
an
entire
type
of
contract
is
inconsistent
with
section
of
the
cea
instead
the
cftc
is
required
to
make
the
determination
that
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
terms
of
that
contract
if
congress
had
sought
to
make
all
contracts
relating
to
the
enumerated
activities
in
cea
section
categorically
unlawful
without
further
analysis
it
would
have
done
so
the
cea
instead
contemplates
a
public
interest
determination
be
made
by
the
commission
based
on
relevant
evidence
and
analysis
which
the
proposal
does
not
do
accordingly
ice
does
not
support
the
cftc
proposed
determination
and
amended
regulation
that
event
contracts
involving
each
of
the
enumerated
activities
in
cea
section
gaming
war
terrorism
assassination
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
are
as
a
category
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibited
from
being
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
on
a
registered
entity
further
as
a
matter
of
policy
prohibiting
entire
categories
of
exchange
traded
contracts
without
analysis
by
the
commission
is
unprecedented
and
conflicts
with
the
cftc
mission
and
the
cea
directive
to
promote
product
innovation
the
proposal
approach
is
a
disservice
to
regulated
exchanges
and
market
participants
as
it
precludes
innovation
in
entire
categories
of
products
without
consideration
of
whether
the
contracts
can
be
constructed
in
a
manner
that
addresses
concerns
about
the
underlying
activities
the
proposal
does
not
appropriately
implement
the
commission
authority
provided
by
congress
ice
also
disagrees
with
the
commission
approach
to
defining
gaming
for
purposes
of
the
cea
section
and
rule
ice
does
not
believe
the
proposed
broad
definition
of
gaming
which
would
include
contracts
relating
to
any
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
would
be
appropriate
if
the
commission
goal
is
to
define
gaming
to
include
betting
on
the
outcome
of
sporting
or
similar
events
it
should
draft
a
narrower
definition
ice
further
believes
that
the
cftc
proposal
to
extend
the
concept
of
gaming
to
include
any
contract
involving
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
based
on
a
political
contest
goes
well
beyond
the
statutory
language
if
the
commission
believes
that
contracts
based
on
a
political
contest
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thus
unlawful
it
should
make
that
determination
through
a
specific
order
or
rulemaking
after
evaluating
evidence
and
undertaking
analysis
of
that
contract
not
by
distorting
the
term
gaming
beyond
it
generally
understood
meaning
ultimately
congress
intended
that
the
commission
regulate
event
contracts
within
the
framework
of
the
section
prohibitions
however
instead
of
providing
clear
guidance
on
how
the
commission
will
regulate
exchanges
and
the
listing
of
new
event
contracts
the
commission
has
identified
broad
categories
of
event
contracts
that
simply
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
if
the
commission
believes
that
certain
types
of
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
provide
specific
analysis
of
those
contracts
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
considering
the
statutory
language
and
goals
of
the
cea
as
proposed
the
amendments
would
interfere
with
the
development
of
new
types
of
contracts
that
may
be
appropriate
for
exchange
trading
and
may
be
beneficial
to
market
participants
ice
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposal
ice
shares
the
commission
goals
of
promoting
transparency
accountability
and
predictability
and
facilitating
effective
oversight
ice
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
consider
its
comments
in
light
of
those
goals
