proposed
congressional
control
contracts
pursuant
to

trading
commission
regulation
dear
chairman
and
commissioners
i
am
writing
in
support
of
kalshi
application
to
run
prediction
markets
on
political
outcomes
i
will
argue
that
prediction
markets
offer
significant
public
benefits
with
minimal
downsides
i
am
a
professor
of
economics
at
dartmouth
and
a
significant
component
of
my
research
agenda
involves
prediction
markets
my
work
includes
both
studies
of
prediction
markets
themselves
and
research
that
uses
prediction
market
prices
as
an
input
to
an
analysis
i
attach
a
bibliography
to
the
end
of
this
letter
i
have
found
political
prediction
markets
to
be
particularly
useful
in
tracking
the
arrival
of
political
news
that
influences
other
asset
prices
allowing
one
to
understand
the
economic
effects
of
political
outcomes
examples
include
prospective
analysis
of
the
expected
impact
of
the
2003
iraq
war
wolfers
and
zitzewitz
2009
and
the
2016
presidential
election
wolfers
and
zitzewitz
2016
and
2018
as
well
as
retrospective
analyses
of
other
presidential
and
congressional
elections

and

prediction
markets
on
policy
outcomes
such
as
the
corporate
tax
rate
also
informed
my
analysis
of
the
post
event
evolution
of
beliefs
about
the
consequences
of
the
2016
election
and
brexit
vote
fisman
and
zitzewitz
2019
in
the
course
of
this
research
i
spoke
with
numerous
financial
market
participants
who
find
prediction
market
prices
a
useful
input
into
their
decision
making
by
aggregating
information
about
political
risk
political
prediction
markets
allow
investors
to
focus
on
other
issues
potentially
reducing
asymmetric
information
and
improving
market
liquidity
research
on
emerging
market
corporate
bond
markets
have
found
an
analogous
role
for
sovereign
bonds
dittmar
and
yuan
2008
in
order
for
markets
to
be
useful
people
have
to
trade
in
them
if
traders
are
rational
and
only
participate
out
of
a
profit
motive
unsubsidized
markets
will
unravel
as
the
less
informed
investors
exit
traders
need
to
be
willing
to
participate
even
when
they
should
rationally
expect
to
lose
money
three
reasons
why
they
might
do
so
are
entertainment
overconfidence
and
hedging
wolfers
and
zitzewitz
2006
markets
need
to
reach
a
certain
scale
before
they
are
useful
for
hedging
and
this
will
likely
never
happen
unless
we
tolerate
markets
that
are
fun
on
topics
about
which
investors
find
it
easy
to
be
overconfident
two
of
the
three
firms
who
ran
the
corporate
prediction
markets
i
studied
in
cowgill
and
zitzewitz
2015
included
fun
markets
participants
told
us
that
they
often
started
trading
for
the
fun
markets
but
stayed
for
the
serious
ones
these
forces
are
or
were
clearly
also
at
work
at
tradesports
intrade
betfair
and
predictit
markets
on
topics
such
as
sports
or
the
number
of
times
president
trump
tweets
arguably
do
not
provide
information
on
a
topic
of
broad
direct
economic
relevance
yet
they
are
often
the
killer
app
that
brings
traders
to
the
markets
that
do
political
prediction
markets
however
are
the
rare
combination
they
are
economically
useful
but
also
fun
to
trade
in
and
on
topics
that
inspire
strong
and
sometimes
overconfident
opinion
so
the
case
for
allowing
kalshi
to
run
them
is
two
fold
they
will
both
provide
useful
information
in
themselves
as
well
as
likely
augment
the
liquidity
of
the
many
other
useful
markets
kalshi
is
running
on
topics
such
as
covid
climate
change
and
air
transportation
congestion
finally
your
question
13
raises
concerns
about
politically
motivated
manipulation
of
the
prices
in
the
markets
as
hanson
and
oprea
2009
correctly
argue
manipulation
encourages
entry
to
trade
against
it
in
the
long
run
this
improves
liquidity
and
the
accuracy
of
prices
moreover
the
long
run
often
arrives
sooner
than
one
might
expect
as
past
suspected
episodes
of
manipulation
have
involved
relatively
quick
reversion
of
prices
see
rhode
and
strumpf
2008
consistent
with
the
lab
experiments
of
hanson
oprea
and
porter
2006
in
summary
i
strongly
support
kalshi
proposal
and
hope
it
and
other
proposals
like
it
are
approved
