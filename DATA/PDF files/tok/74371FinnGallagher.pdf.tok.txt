i
am
writing
to
express
my
concerns
regarding
the
commission
proposal
to
ban
election
contracts
and
prediction
markets
it
appears
that
there
has
been
a
misinterpretation
of
former
senator
blanche
lincoln
2010
colloquy
the
intent
behind
her
remarks
was
not
to
prohibit
these
markets
her
comment
makes
this
very
clear
but
to
encourage
innovation
within
a
regulated
framework
senator
lincoln
discussion
with
senator
feinstein
focused
on
ensuring
that
contracts
serve
a
hedging
or
economic
purpose
rather
than
being
predominantly
speculative
however
this
should
not
be
construed
as
a
call
to
ban
election
markets
entirely
but
rather
to
regulate
them
appropriately
to
ensure
they
serve
the
public
interest
furthermore
the
cftc
definition
of
gaming
as
it
pertains
to
political
contests
is
problematic
the
agency
interpretation
seems
to
conflate
legitimate
financial
instruments
with
gambling
which
mischaracterizes
the
economic
utility
these
markets
provide
election
markets
can
offer
valuable
insights
into
public
sentiment
and
serve
as
tools
for
managing
risks
associated
with
political
outcomes
they
are
not
merely
speculative
wagers
but
can
have
genuine
hedging
applications
for
businesses
and
investors
the
argument
that
allowing
election
markets
would
position
the
cftc
as
election
cops
is
flawed
proper
regulation
rather
than
prohibition
can
address
concerns
about
market
integrity
and
electoral
influence
by
establishing
a
clear
regulatory
framework
the
cftc
can
ensure
that
these
markets
operate
transparently
and
ethically
without
overstepping
its
mandate
i
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
and
focus
on
creating
a
regulatory
environment
that
allows
for
innovation
and
the
safe
operation
of
election
markets
this
approach
would
prevent
activity
from
moving
offshore
to
unregulated
platforms
and
ensure
that
american
consumers
and
businesses
can
benefit
from
these
markets
within
a
secure
and
overseen
system
