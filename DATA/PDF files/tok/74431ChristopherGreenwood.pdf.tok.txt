your

and
conor
daly
the
court
good
afternoon
everyone
so
we
are
here
on
the
parties
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
i
do
typically
have
oral
argument
although
i
thought
this
was
a
case
where
argument
would
be
helpful
to
me
in
resolving
the
motions
i
do
know
who
arguing
for
plaintiff
is
there
a
time
sensitivity
in
this
case
i
know
there
not
a
pi
that
been
filed
but
i
just
trying
to
understand
mr
roth
it
was
actually
the
first
thing
i
was
going
to
say
was
thank
you
for
hearing
argument
on
motions
we
have
asked
for
a
preliminary
injunction
but
there
is
time
some
time
sensitivity
because
the
contracts
are
tied
to
the
november
elections
so
what
we
would
like
ideally
is
a
resolution
that
would
allow
if
needed
for
appellate
intervention
so
that
the
contracts
can
be
listed
prior
to
that
election
the
court
that
was
my
preliminary
question
all
right
i
will
start
with
plaintiff
i
may
interrupt
with
some
questions
but
otherwise
will
try
to
restrain
myself
to
listen
to
your
presentation
mr
roth
great
thank
you
so
much
your
honor
so
as
your
honor
knows
we
filed
this
case
because
the
commission
blocked
kalshi
from
listing
its
event
contracts
that
turn
on
partisan
control
of
the
house
and
the
senate
and
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
that
agency
action
complies
with
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
the
apa
and
we
reproduced
on
a
slide
here
the
text
of
the
key
statutory
provision
from
the
commodity
exchange
act
and
as
you
see
it
authorizes
the
commission
to
block
prohibit
the
listing
of
event
contract
if
two
elements
are
satisfied
first
the
contract
has
to
involve
one
of
the
six
enumerated
categories
of
activities
and
then
if
it
does
the
commission
may
determine
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
which
case
it
prohibited
so
far
i
do
think
that
a
point
of
dispute
that
just
what
the
statute
says
following
that
framework
our
challenge
here
has
two
basic
components
first
we
do
dispute
that
kalshi
contracts
fall
within
the
scope
of
those
six
any
of
those
six
enumerated
categories
and
that
really
just
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation
then
the
second
piece
is
that
we
argue
that
even
assuming
the
contracts
did
fall
within
one
of
those
categories
that
commission
public
interest
analysis
was
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
court
i
know
i
said
i
was
going
to
restrain
myself
but
can
i
ask
just
a
preliminary
question
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
because
of
this
two
step
framework
that
the
statute
sets
forth
that
if
it
not
in
i
say
enumerated
although
the
last
one
is
a
catchall
in
not
one
of
these
categories
then
you
do
even
get
to
public
interest
i
noticed
in
your
brief
you
had
outlined
some
of
the
safeguards
that
you
client
has
put
in
into
place
with
respect
to
this
contract
in
particular
for
example
paid
members
of
congressional
staff
are
permitted
to
trade
other
safeguards
i
assuming
that
your
client
thought
those
were
important
to
maintain
integrity
of
the
process
mr
roth
correct
the
court
but
under
your
argument
because
elections
do
fall
according
to
you
in
these
categories
there
no
occasion
for
cftc
to
even
reach
those
safeguards
so
presumably
someone
could
post
an
event
contract
similarly
to
what
your
client
does
another
dcm
could
do
this
without
any
of
those
safeguards
and
it
my
understanding
that
under
your
framework
cftc
would
not
have
any
interest
in
that
mr
roth
i
agree
that
it
would
be
relevant
to
whether
it
falls
within
one
of
these
statutory
categories
and
therefore
this
provision
would
not
capture
it
what
i
not
sure
about
and
what
i
can
ask
is
whether
there
are
other
regulations
or
provisions
that
may
the
court
come
into
play
mr
roth
yeah
that
may
speak
to
issues
like
that
like
who
allowed
to
trade
on
it
are
there
certain
restrictions
beyond
this
sort
of
in
or
out
provision
which
is
just
it
either
allowed
or
it
not
allowed
the
court
on
a
similar
vein
i
understood
one
of
your
positions
to
be
look
this
is
a
contract
involving
control
of
the
house
it
not
talking
about
a
discrete
election
between
two
candidates
there
are
so
many
intervening
factors
that
have
to
occur
before
not
even
intervening
factors
but
it
not
often
dispositive
of
one
election
who
controls
the
chamber
under
your
framework
though
would
a
dcm
be
able
to
post
an
event
contract
for
a
presidential
election
mr
roth
yes
the
court
okay
so
that
piece
is
responsive
or
relevant
to
what
your
point
about
this
being
a
house
about
control
of
the
house
and
that
it
not
you
know
a
two
party
or
two
candidate
election
there
a
lot
of
moving
parts
what
is
that
relevant
to
mr
roth
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way
the
court
okay
mr
roth
if
you
imagine
that
there
was
a
category
on
this
list
that
said
elections
the
court
okay
mr
roth
then
i
think
one
could
still
say
that
these
contracts
involve
elections
even
though
it
one
step
removed
from
the
election
itself
the
court
okay
mr
roth
which
goes
to
an
issue
that
was
sort
of
debated
in
the
briefs
which
is
does
it
have
been
to
be
literally
the
underlying
event
or
does
it
have
to
does
this
underlying
event
just
have
to
relate
to
the
category
we
agree
it
enough
that
it
relates
to
the
category
so
if
you
had
the
category
that
said
elections
even
though
this
was
a
couple
steps
removed
i
think
you
could
say
it
would
relate
to
elections
and
therefore
fall
within
the
scope
our
main
argument
though
is
it
does
say
elections
the
court
all
right
continue
please
mr
roth
okay
what
i
was
going
to
say
before
moving
on
was
i
going
to
be
speaking
to
the
statutory
interpretation
piece
of
the
argument
and
my
colleague
amanda
rice
is
going
to
be
speaking
to
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
piece
when
i
done
looking
to
the
enumerated
categories
we
can
sort
of
simplify
by
taking
four
of
them
off
the
list
right
off
the
bat
the
last
one
as
your
honor
noted
is
a
catchall
the
commission
is
essentially
allowed
to
add
categories
by
rule
if
they
similar
to
the
listed
five
the
commission
has
done
that
so
we
can
sort
of
cross
that
one
off
the
list
for
now
and
then
obviously
the
commission
does
not
argue
that
these
contracts
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
they
do
think
involve
is
very
broad
but
not
broad
enough
to
get
them
quite
that
far
so
we
can
strike
two
three
and
four
from
the
list
as
well
and
that
leaves
the
two
enumerated
categories
that
the
commission
focuses
on
which
are
number
1
unlawful
activity
and
then
number
five
gaming
and
i
like
to
take
them
in
that
order
which
is
the
order
they
appear
in
the
statute
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
starting
with
the
unlawful
activity
the
way
we
understand
that
is
that
it
refers
to
contracts
where
the
underlying
event
relates
to
some
unlawful
act
okay
so
for
example
if
you
had
a
contract
on
whether
the
murder
rate
in
2024
is
going
exceed
a
certain
level
if
you
had
a
contract
on
whether
a
particular
piece
of
art
in
the
national
gallery
is
going
to
be
stolen
within
a
period
of
time
those
are
unlawful
acts
if
you
had
a
contract
on
those
events
it
would
fall
within
the
scope
of
number
one
i
think
it
fits
the
text
and
i
think
it
fits
the
context
of
the
statute
and
that
sort
of
an
important
point
it
aligns
it
with
the
terrorism
assassination
and
war
provisions
that
immediately
follow
it
if
you
think
about
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
common
denominator
is
they
bad
those
are
things
we
do
they
bad
things
congress
is
concerned
about
people
profiting
from
bad
things
and
about
incentives
to
do
bad
things
right
using
my
hypothetical
of
the
murder
rate
you
do
want
somebody
to
go
hire
a
hit
man
to
get
the
rate
above
a
level
so
you
can
make
money
bad
incentives
it
also
just
feels
offensive
to
have
people
profiting
from
you
know
there
was
a
terrorist
attack
i
going
to
make
a
lot
of
money
from
that
that
sort
of
the
gist
of
2
3
and
4
if
you
read
1
the
way
we
read
1
it
lines
up
perfectly
with
that
we
do
want
to
incentivize
crime
we
do
want
to
have
people
profiting
from
crime
so
it
all
parallel
and
of
course
that
interpretation
does
sweep
in
kalshi
contracts
elections
are
not
unlawful
they
do
even
relate
to
unlawful
activity
so
now
let
consider
the
commission
interpretation
as
i
understand
it
on
this
prong
what
they
saying
is
some
states
prohibit
betting
on
elections
either
as
part
of
their
gambling
statutes
or
in
stand
alone
provisions
and
the
commission
admits
that
those
state
laws
do
directly
apply
in
the
sense
that
they
ca
prohibit
trading
on
a
regulated
exchange
because
of
preemption
principles
but
the
way
i
understand
what
they
arguing
is
that
they
say
well
buying
and
selling
those
contracts
sort
of
amounts
to
a
betting
on
an
election
because
you
staking
something
of
value
on
the
electoral
outcome
if
you
did
that
outside
the
context
of
a
regulated
exchange
then
it
would
violate
these
state
laws
and
therefore
the
trading
of
the
contract
relates
to
unlawful
activity
so
a
couple
problems
with
that
number
one
unlike
our
interpretation
it
does
align
with
the
three
that
follow
it
because
the
key
move
that
they
making
there
is
instead
of
looking
at
the
underlying
event
and
whether
it
is
related
to
the
enumerated
activity
they
looking
at
the
trading
of
the
contract
and
whether
it
related
to
the
underlying
activity
that
is
a
sort
of
just
a
different
focus
of
the
analysis
and
it
makes
1
sort
of
stand
out
relative
to
2
3
and
4
the
court
can
i
ask
you
about
that
because
i
think
that
this
defendant
made
this
point
the
government
made
this
point
where
it
says
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involved
what
work
do
you
argue
transactions
is
doing
in
the
statute
as
it
relates
to
involve
mr
roth
as
i
understand
it
the
agreement
contract
or
transaction
sort
of
triplet
it
appears
throughout
the
statute
it
just
the
way
they
refer
to
these
types
of
instruments
when
they
define
it
so
i
do
think
that
they
have
independent
significance
i
think
they
just
capturing
any
different
way
you
might
structure
the
arraignment
the
court
so
you
not
reading
transactions
to
refer
to
the
act
of
trading
the
thing
it
another
way
to
say
contract
agreement
it
is
the
contract
itself
mr
roth
it
the
instrument
and
i
think
that
follows
from
the
fact
that
this
is
how
it
used
throughout
the
statute
the
three
together
and
just
to
be
clear
we
not
saying
that
you
could
have
a
statute
that
said
transaction
involving
x
where
what
it
meant
was
the
act
of
contracting
it
involves
that
activity
it
not
that
that
semantically
impossible
it
grammatically
appropriate
it
makes
sense
it
just
that
it
does
line
up
with
the
way
the
statute
works
for
2
3
and
4
and
so
it
makes
it
just
an
unusual
sort
of
strange
way
of
speaking
the
hypothetical
i
was
thinking
about
as
i
was
preparing
you
could
say
my
lunch
generally
involves
a
sandwich
a
salad
a
pastry
or
robust
conversation
with
my
work
colleagues
you
could
say
that
and
yes
it
could
involve
those
things
but
putting
them
together
in
that
way
is
weird
it
not
the
way
people
normally
speak
but
i
actually
do
think
that
the
most
problematic
aspect
of
the
commission
reading
of
the
unlawful
category
i
think
the
most
serious
problem
with
it
and
the
one
that
really
is
i
think
fatal
is
that
it
proves
way
too
much
because
as
the
commission
observes
elsewhere
in
the
briefing
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
states
that
prohibit
betting
on
any
contingent
event
if
we
go
to
the
second
slide
we
collected
them
there
at
least
29
that
we
found
that
prohibit
staking
something
of
value
on
an
uncertain
event
or
contingency
and
of
course
that
defines
an
event
contract
it
would
mean
that
every
event
contract
falls
within
the
scope
of
roman
i
and
would
involve
unlawful
activity
and
that
just
ca
be
right
because
it
makes
the
other
five
enumerated
activities
superfluous
and
it
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
having
enumerated
activities
in
the
first
place
because
it
would
allow
the
commission
to
subject
every
event
contract
to
public
interest
scrutiny
so
every
kind
of
interpretation
tells
us
that
wrong
and
so
does
the
statutory
history
because
sort
of
notably
prior
to
2000
that
is
how
the
statute
worked
if
we
go
to
the
next
slide
we
have
that
language
they
actually
have
to
make
this
public
interest
determination
for
every
contract
that
was
repealed
in
2000
and
then
in
2010
congress
enacted
this
more
limit
provision
that
singles
out
the
categories
so
i
think
anything
that
covers
the
waterfront
is
necessarily
an
erroneous
interpretation
i
think
the
commission
actually
admits
that
they
say
on
page
11
of
their
final
reply
brief
that
sure
you
ca
read
any
of
these
to
cover
everything
that
would
not
be
tenable
and
so
they
try
to
explain
why
their
interpretation
does
do
that
and
just
to
be
candid
i
do
really
understand
what
they
trying
to
do
there
to
me
if
kalshi
contracts
involve
unlawful
activity
because
some
states
prohibit
betting
on
elections
then
all
event
contracts
involve
unlawful
activity
because
some
states
ban
betting
on
contingent
events
so
i
think
the
bottom
line
on
number
1
is
our
interpretation
is
the
only
one
that
sort
of
makes
sense
in
context
that
gives
this
provision
real
work
to
do
without
swallowing
everything
else
the
court
can
you
respond
and
apologies
if
it
in
your
reply
the
commission
gave
an
example
of
a
circumstance
in
which
they
would
say
a
contract
involved
war
without
the
underlying
event
actually
being
about
war
and
i
think
the
example
they
gave
is
whether
the
ukrainian
military
will
acquire
certain
munitions
in
2024
can
you
speak
to
that
example
they
saying
well
that
would
be
under
their
broader
reading
involve
something
that
relates
to
war
but
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
is
not
itself
an
act
of
war
mr
roth
that
may
have
been
our
example
i
not
sure
because
i
think
we
agree
with
that
it
may
have
been
theirs
the
court
maybe
it
was
your
example
sorry
mr
roth
i
not
sure
it
a
point
where
the
parties
disagree
i
think
it
goes
to
the
difference
between
involve
and
based
on
the
court
i
think
that
was
your
example
mr
roth
so
based
on
would
speak
literally
about
the
underlying
event
that
too
narrow
for
this
this
says
involve
so
there
this
broader
scope
our
point
is
that
the
broader
scope
is
tethered
around
the
event
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
you
still
looking
at
the
event
and
saying
does
the
event
relate
to
unlawful
activity
does
it
relate
to
war
does
it
relate
to
terrorism
so
you
can
sort
of
game
it
by
circumventing
by
sort
of
making
it
technically
something
that
just
a
proxy
it
would
capture
this
the
court
i
just
wanted
you
to
flesh
that
out
okay
mr
roth
okay
the
court
so
when
they
say
that
you
reading
or
using
the
word
involved
too
narrowly
you
would
dispute
that
you
not
disputing
that
involve
means
relate
to
all
those
other
dictionary
definitions
of
involve
it
just
relates
to
the
underlying
event
in
the
contract
mr
roth
it
what
has
to
involve
we
do
actually
disagree
on
what
involve
means
we
disagree
on
what
has
to
involve
what
right
it
a
subtle
but
important
point
okay
that
takes
us
through
roman
unless
your
honor
has
further
questions
about
unlawful
activity
i
move
to
gaming
which
is
the
second
one
that
they
argue
again
the
fight
is
about
what
does
gaming
mean
in
this
statutory
context
our
core
point
is
really
simple
gaming
requires
a
game
so
if
there
no
underlying
game
there
no
gaming
and
so
for
example
if
you
have
a
contract
on
who
going
to
win
the
kentucky
derby
that
a
game
it
a
horse
race
it
a
game
if
you
have
an
event
contract
on
who
going
to
win
the
super
bowl
or
the
point
spread
in
the
super
bowl
it
involves
a
game
there
an
underlying
game
same
thing
with
the
lottery
they
have
an
underlying
game
that
forms
the
basis
for
the
contract
and
if
you
read
it
and
you
understand
it
that
way
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
benefits
to
that
number
one
going
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
earlier
it
lines
it
up
with
the
others
in
the
sense
that
there
is
this
connection
back
to
the
underlying
event
rather
than
just
talking
about
the
act
of
trading
in
isolation
number
two
i
think
is
most
consistent
with
the
text
the
root
word
of
gaming
is
game
i
think
it
aligns
with
the
legislative
history
the
famous
colloquy
that
gets
a
lot
of
discussion
in
the
briefing
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
which
by
the
way
if
your
honor
wants
to
watch
it
on
c
span
you
wo
be
able
to
find
it
i
think
it
was
inserted
in
writing
after
the
fact
it
was
literally
a
colloquy
but
you
can
see
it
in
the
congressional
record
and
they
give
three
examples
of
gaming
contracts
football
horseracing
and
golf
they
all
games
i
do
think
that
an
accident
i
think
that
interpretation
makes
sense
too
because
what
is
a
game
it
something
that
has
no
inherent
economic
significance
it
something
that
is
done
for
amusement
it
may
be
done
for
sport
it
may
be
done
purely
to
facilitate
the
betting
itself
right
for
its
own
sake
so
i
think
it
makes
sense
for
congress
to
have
thought
about
that
category
contracts
that
involve
games
are
probably
not
the
type
of
contracts
that
we
want
to
be
listed
on
an
exchange
because
they
do
have
any
real
economic
value
to
them
but
again
what
tying
that
together
is
the
existence
of
the
game
because
the
game
is
the
thing
that
does
have
intrinsic
economic
significance
now
of
course
elections
are
not
games
they
not
done
for
amusement
they
not
done
for
sport
they
not
done
to
facilitate
betting
elections
matter
they
determine
our
government
they
determine
our
governance
nobody
would
really
call
them
games
so
in
our
view
a
contract
relating
to
an
election
is
not
gaming
the
court
i
have
never
before
this
case
considered
the
difference
between
gaming
and
gambling
but
i
love
to
hear
more
about
your
position
on
that
because
i
did
look
at
the
various
dictionary
definitions
just
to
understand
what
these
words
mean
that
i
have
used
many
times
and
there
are
some
definitions
that
you
would
say
cross
reference
and
they
say
define
as
gambling
so
i
understand
your
position
to
be
sure
gaming
is
part
of
gambling
but
gambling
is
not
gaming
or
gaming
is
a
subset
of
gambling
gambling
is
not
synonymous
with
gaming
mr
roth
i
do
think
that
the
better
understanding
of
the
way
the
terms
relate
i
think
gaming
has
this
more
close
tie
to
the
game
whereas
gambling
can
have
a
broader
meaning
i
will
say
when
i
went
through
the
dictionary
definitions
closely
what
i
found
was
i
think
this
is
important
even
if
you
look
at
the
definition
of
gambling
there
generally
two
different
definitions
that
are
offered
in
the
dictionaries
there
a
narrower
one
and
there
a
broader
one
so
for
example
the
merriam
webster
the
first
definition
of
gamble
is
to
play
a
game
for
money
or
property
the
second
definition
is
to
stake
something
on
a
contingency
or
take
a
chance
okay
so
you
got
one
definition
that
is
tied
to
a
game
and
then
one
definition
that
is
not
tied
to
a
game
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
concise
oxford
english
dictionary
which
i
think
is
also
cited
in
the
briefs
two
definitions
of
gamble
number
one
play
games
of
chance
for
money
number
two
take
risky
action
in
the
hope
of
a
desired
result
i
think
that
sort
of
fair
there
are
two
different
ways
of
understanding
gambling
one
is
tied
to
the
existence
of
a
game
and
one
is
just
colloquially
sort
of
broader
right
a
betting
i
think
what
important
here
is
that
the
broader
definition
does
not
work
for
the
same
reasons
we
talked
about
earlier
if
you
sort
of
adopted
and
imported
the
broader
definition
of
gambling
and
treated
any
contract
that
involves
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
or
an
uncertain
outcome
then
you
covered
the
waterfront
of
event
contracts
and
so
that
ca
be
the
right
interpretation
of
gaming
in
the
statute
and
i
think
that
leaves
us
with
the
narrower
interpretation
in
the
dictionary
which
incorporates
the
concept
of
a
game
now
the
cftc
they
recognized
this
problem
with
the
broader
definition
and
actually
not
i
did
fully
understand
this
from
the
order
but
from
the
briefing
it
became
clear
they
sort
of
disclaiming
the
broader
definition
because
they
understand
that
that
does
work
in
context
and
so
instead
they
sort
of
offering
a
intermediate
approach
where
they
say
well
it
does
require
betting
on
a
game
or
a
contest
and
then
they
say
an
election
is
a
contest
so
voila
there
we
go
it
fits
in
the
brief
we
walk
through
each
step
of
that
logic
what
i
like
to
here
is
offer
a
few
higher
level
observations
on
that
argument
because
when
you
take
a
step
back
especially
i
think
it
just
too
clever
by
half
it
sort
of
this
lawyerly
attempt
to
parse
it
and
get
it
in
it
not
really
a
serious
attempt
at
statutory
interpretation
i
just
offer
a
few
reasons
for
that
number
1
if
congress
was
really
trying
to
get
at
election
contracts
the
easy
way
to
do
that
would
have
been
to
have
a
roman
vi
or
vii
that
said
elections
very
easy
one
word
to
say
that
they
were
trying
to
do
it
by
saying
gaming
which
some
definitions
cross
reference
gambling
which
you
could
say
involves
a
game
or
contest
it
the
most
attenuated
way
of
getting
at
this
so
strained
that
i
do
think
it
very
credible
second
point
is
there
no
support
for
this
in
the
legislative
history
the
colloquy
again
it
all
games
nothing
about
politics
third
if
you
look
at
where
they
getting
the
word
contest
from
it
really
instructive
because
they
pull
it
from
a
few
state
statutes
and
if
we
pull
up
we
got
the
text
of
a
couple
of
the
samples
of
those
but
it
very
clear
when
you
look
at
them
that
they
talking
about
contests
that
are
like
games
so
for
example
this
is
the
delaware
their
version
which
is
also
materially
identical
to
florida
and
they
talk
about
betting
or
wagering
on
the
result
of
any
trial
or
contests
wherever
conducted
of
skill
speed
or
power
of
endurance
or
human
or
beast
i
suppose
there
are
some
candidates
for
office
who
may
be
described
as
beasts
but
it
really
not
i
just
do
think
anyone
would
say
in
this
context
of
the
statute
contest
means
election
just
like
you
would
say
in
the
context
of
the
statute
that
trial
means
a
trial
in
this
courtroom
that
not
what
this
is
about
same
thing
if
you
look
at
the
next
this
is
the
louisiana
version
talks
about
conducting
as
a
business
any
game
contest
lottery
or
contrivance
when
you
put
game
and
lottery
next
to
contest
it
i
think
implies
a
certain
meaning
and
treating
that
as
including
elections
is
really
a
stretch
i
think
we
would
we
do
dispute
that
you
can
refer
to
an
election
as
a
contest
just
like
you
can
refer
to
a
corporate
board
fight
as
a
contest
you
could
refer
to
a
lawsuit
as
a
contest
but
in
the
context
of
these
gambling
statutes
that
not
what
they
are
talking
about
and
then
the
final
point
on
this
is
i
think
it
just
leads
to
some
really
arbitrary
results
because
if
you
focus
on
gaming
as
involving
a
game
then
there
a
certain
sense
to
it
right
as
i
said
earlier
like
games
do
have
any
external
economic
significance
generally
speaking
so
as
a
category
it
makes
sense
for
congress
the
carve
that
out
if
you
treat
it
as
games
plus
elections
it
very
strange
because
it
means
you
could
have
event
contracts
on
the
weather
on
whether
somebody
going
to
be
nominated
for
a
cabinet
role
on
what
color
dress
taylor
swift
is
going
to
wear
next
week
any
of
those
are
fine
but
elections
would
be
swept
up
by
the
gaming
category
it
just
weird
because
even
if
you
think
look
elections
are
different
and
should
be
treated
differently
and
i
know
my
colleague
is
going
to
try
to
explain
why
that
misguided
but
even
if
you
accepted
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
word
gaming
so
i
think
the
sort
of
takeaway
is
the
commission
is
latching
onto
this
word
as
sort
of
a
convenient
way
to
squeeze
its
desired
policy
outcome
into
the
statute
but
it
not
a
serious
attempt
to
really
understand
what
congress
meant
by
this
term
in
this
context
the
court
when
you
saying
and
i
would
agree
that
a
game
does
have
any
external
economic
significance
how
does
that
how
is
that
relevant
for
the
specific
argument
you
making
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
that
mr
roth
what
i
mean
is
if
we
trying
to
think
of
what
was
congress
trying
to
get
at
with
gaming
the
court
okay
mr
roth
if
we
understand
gaming
to
mean
a
contract
that
involves
an
underlying
game
then
there
a
certain
policy
sense
to
treating
that
category
differently
because
congress
could
have
been
thinking
about
it
and
saying
well
there
is
some
of
this
in
the
legislative
history
the
colloquy
if
you
look
at
it
well
games
do
matter
in
the
real
word
they
games
so
we
do
want
people
essentially
gambling
right
on
something
that
does
matter
in
a
cftc
regulated
exchange
so
it
gives
some
sense
to
the
categorization
that
congress
laid
out
and
the
problem
i
have
with
the
alternative
interpretations
is
they
do
have
that
sort
of
unifying
policy
rationale
behind
them
right
again
the
really
broad
version
sweeps
up
everything
that
does
work
and
then
games
plus
elections
what
is
tying
those
things
together
it
not
it
does
seem
to
me
a
line
that
you
could
really
seriously
draw
from
this
word
so
that
what
i
trying
to
get
at
the
court
okay
mr
roth
okay
so
that
takes
care
of
roman
v
and
so
our
position
is
that
is
then
the
end
of
the
analysis
and
there
no
need
to
go
any
further
but
i
will
turn
it
over
to
my
colleague
if
your
honor
has
no
further
questions
on
this
piece
to
address
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
issue
the
court
there
are
a
lot
of
references
by
the
commission
about
kind
of
representations
on
your
client
website
about
what
it
does
do
you
want
to
respond
to
that
mr
roth
i
think
it
a
page
that
just
pulls
press
articles
the
court
okay
mr
roth
so
it
just
like
a
collection
of
links
to
articles
that
have
mentioned
kalshi
it
not
like
a
representation
by
the
client
about
what
the
court
what
its
business
is
mr
roth
it
like
here
people
are
talking
about
us
here
a
list
of
stories
the
court
okay
mr
roth
thank
you
your
honor
ms
rice
good
morning
your
honor
my
name
is
amanda
rice
and
i
here
to
talk
briefly
about
the
commission
public
interest
analysis
as
my
colleague
explained
we
think
the
statutory
issue
is
dispositive
so
you
do
have
to
go
this
far
so
i
try
to
keep
it
pretty
quick
but
even
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
the
statutory
argument
they
are
still
required
here
because
the
agency
public
policy
analysis
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
i
start
with
just
a
brief
note
on
the
standard
of
review
there
was
some
back
and
forth
on
this
issue
in
the
brief
but
as
i
think
the
commission
acknowledges
in
the
end
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
applies
to
all
final
agency
actions
regardless
of
their
form
that
a
deferential
standard
for
sure
but
it
has
some
real
teeth
it
means
agencies
have
to
engage
in
reasoned
decision
making
and
agency
actions
are
arbitrary
and
capricious
if
they
apply
the
wrong
standard
or
ignore
relevant
considerations
or
they
do
explain
themselves
reasonably
those
are
the
kinds
of
arguments
we
making
here
and
they
go
to
both
sides
of
the
public
interest
analysis
the
sort
of
benefits
on
the
one
hand
and
the
alleged
harms
on
the
other
so
i
take
those
two
points
in
turn
starting
with
the
benefits
court
reporter
clarification
ms
rice
i
was
trying
to
be
quick
but
do
want
to
speak
too
quick
the
court
take
your
time
ms
rice
so
the
economic
benefits
all
follow
i
think
from
one
simple
proposition
which
is
that
partisan
control
of
congress
has
economic
implications
i
think
that
pretty
commonsensical
but
there
a
ton
of
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
that
point
i
just
got
a
couple
of
points
highlighted
on
the
slides
here
the
first
one
is
from
harvard
professor
jason
furman
who
a
former
chairman
of
president
obama
council
of
economic
advisors
he
explains
that
congressional
control
impacts
legislation
policy
and
the
business
environment
in
ways
that
have
direct
economic
consequences
to
businesses
and
workers
he
says
this
risk
is
conceptually
identical
to
climate
risk
business
interruption
risk
and
other
risks
that
can
be
managed
using
financial
markets
on
the
next
slide
we
got
managing
director
of
jpmorgan
so
coming
from
a
different
perspective
who
explains
that
election
risk
is
one
of
the
largest
risks
that
their
clients
face
that
the
frequently
engage
proactively
on
how
to
minimize
it
or
to
hedge
it
hedging
is
a
word
as
i
understand
it
for
minimizing
risk
lisboa
gives
the
example
of
specifically
the
coal
industry
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
examples
in
the
record
that
stand
out
on
different
sides
so
there
a
software
company
serving
green
energy
businesses
it
at
page
1597
of
the
record
there
a
recycling
robotics
firm
that
at
1533
of
the
record
these
are
just
sort
of
common
sense
examples
of
businesses
that
have
direct
control
of
partisan
control
of
congress
and
then
take
it
from
sam
altman
who
the
ceo
of
openai
he
explains
here
the
different
risks
that
biotech
companies
face
those
are
direct
and
they
predictable
he
explains
they
involve
everything
from
the
fda
and
different
approvals
to
research
funding
and
legislation
so
it
not
just
legislation
there
all
kinds
of
other
things
that
congress
is
doing
here
because
these
risks
are
so
significant
financial
institutions
already
offer
projections
on
the
economic
impacts
of
elections
and
there
instruments
for
hedging
against
those
risks
you
already
seen
it
from
jpmorgan
there
more
examples
of
that
on
pages
42
to
44
of
the
record
if
that
helpful
and
then
there
are
the
noneconomic
benefits
researchers
policymakers
the
public
everyone
benefits
from
market
based
data
about
elections
these
markets
already
exist
i
know
your
honor
is
familiar
with
in
nonprofit
forms
because
this
information
is
so
valuable
so
these
are
just
a
few
examples
from
the
record
but
that
really
just
tip
of
the
iceberg
i
thought
pages
40
and
41
of
our
opening
brief
and
68
to
70
of
the
record
really
tell
this
story
of
the
noneconomic
benefits
so
the
agency
does
have
much
to
say
about
either
of
those
two
points
so
they
respond
mostly
by
trying
to
move
the
goal
post
they
make
what
i
understand
to
be
two
primary
arguments
the
first
one
is
about
direct
effects
they
say
that
the
economic
effects
of
elections
sure
that
they
exist
but
they
not
direct
enough
i
think
your
honor
is
using
the
language
of
too
many
intervening
events
to
make
a
difference
we
explained
in
our
brief
that
the
record
says
otherwise
you
already
seen
some
examples
today
i
think
more
important
and
more
fundamental
is
the
idea
that
the
whole
point
of
having
hedging
with
event
contracts
is
to
account
for
diffused
risks
this
is
not
a
one
to
one
kind
of
hedging
product
like
the
way
insurance
works
if
there
a
hurricane
for
example
that
example
helps
me
because
you
can
see
both
the
direct
and
indirect
effects
of
a
hurricane
right
it
might
destroy
property
but
it
does
other
stuff
too
it
deters
tourists
you
ca
always
predict
exactly
what
those
effects
might
be
but
it
a
feature
not
a
bug
of
these
contracts
they
allow
you
to
capture
anything
that
might
follow
from
an
event
like
this
the
court
if
i
can
just
stop
you
right
there
so
what
i
understood
the
argument
on
the
other
side
to
be
is
certainly
if
a
hurricane
hit
the
extent
of
the
damage
or
effect
on
tourism
or
property
that
might
not
be
able
to
be
predicted
in
advance
so
whatever
your
worst
fear
might
not
materialize
but
whatever
effect
there
is
will
be
direct
meaning
to
the
extent
that
there
is
property
damage
you
can
trace
that
directly
to
the
hurricane
so
maybe
the
result
does
materialize
in
the
way
that
it
was
predicted
but
there
is
a
direct
effect
and
my
understanding
is
that
at
least
they
would
argue
with
elections
particularly
in
this
context
where
we
talking
about
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
by
a
party
that
sure
whatever
thought
about
what
might
happen
may
not
materialize
but
to
the
extent
there
is
an
effect
you
may
not
be
able
to
trace
it
directly
to
who
controls
a
party
at
a
given
time
or
a
chamber
of
congress
at
a
different
time
because
there
are
so
many
variables
who
in
office
as
president
kind
of
what
the
split
is
if
it
a
more
even
split
kind
of
what
the
priorities
are
of
congress
despite
control
legislation
does
always
get
passed
or
become
a
priority
so
what
would
you
respond
to
their
point
about
this
not
being
the
kind
of
direct
economic
effect
that
some
of
the
other
trading
contracts
have
ms
rice
i
think
you
right
about
what
their
argument
is
but
i
think
both
pieces
of
it
are
wrong
and
starting
with
the
hurricane
example
i
think
hurricanes
do
have
very
similar
indirect
effects
so
you
talking
about
property
damage
but
that
not
it
there
might
also
be
decreases
in
tourism
that
might
also
have
to
do
with
other
features
of
the
weather
did
an
amusement
park
get
built
nearby
things
like
that
might
also
affect
tourism
it
not
going
to
be
one
to
one
there
actually
a
pretty
helpful
chart
on
pages
53
to
55
of
the
record
that
identifies
some
other
event
contracts
and
tries
to
explain
exactly
that
point
here
are
the
ways
in
which
the
economic
impacts
are
not
direct
they
indirect
and
that
true
of
temperature
fluctuations
so
is
it
going
to
be
hot
in
california
this
month
that
might
have
some
direct
effects
and
then
some
indirect
effects
that
the
first
piece
of
it
the
way
other
contracts
work
the
way
congress
works
there
also
a
lot
of
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
are
direct
effects
here
that
just
the
election
a
change
of
control
in
congress
affects
stock
prices
immediately
affects
the
valuations
of
entities
immediately
without
any
legislation
passing
that
legislation
passing
is
of
course
a
piece
of
this
but
these
economic
impacts
happen
even
if
no
legislation
passes
so
i
thought
the
discussion
at
40
to
46
of
the
record
is
pretty
helpful
on
that
it
has
some
examples
i
point
to
1397
which
shows
that
the
green
energy
sector
surged
as
a
result
of
the
democratic
party
senate
takeover
again
before
anything
happened
it
just
control
of
congress
that
has
these
direct
effects
so
to
circle
back
to
your
question
i
think
direct
effects
is
a
strange
question
to
be
asking
for
these
contracts
but
not
others
when
all
event
contracts
have
these
sort
of
indirect
economic
effects
but
even
if
that
were
the
question
i
think
it
pretty
clear
that
there
are
direct
effects
here
if
that
answers
your
question
the
court
maybe
you
about
to
get
to
this
i
do
want
to
distract
you
from
your
presentation
but
can
you
speak
to
the
manipulation
and
integrity
piece
because
i
do
think
and
obviously
i
going
to
look
very
closely
at
the
statute
and
follow
what
it
says
but
i
do
think
there
is
kind
of
a
just
to
be
honest
a
gut
reaction
that
people
might
have
that
wow
betting
on
elections
does
seem
like
a
good
idea
it
seems
like
there
a
lot
of
room
for
manipulation
for
kind
of
unsavory
things
happening
can
you
speak
to
that
directly
and
what
your
position
is
as
it
relates
to
the
public
interest
concern
because
i
understand
a
significant
part
of
the
commission
view
that
this
is
against
public
interest
has
to
do
with
some
of
those
concerns
ms
rice
absolutely
i
skip
right
there
i
think
you
right
that
that
what
the
commission
said
that
it
sort
of
feels
icky
or
that
there
a
risk
of
election
manipulation
in
some
form
and
i
think
starting
with
the
risk
of
manipulation
which
i
think
is
the
more
serious
public
interest
analysis
the
icky
feeling
i
think
is
misguided
but
i
think
it
stems
from
the
misunderstanding
that
these
contracts
could
influence
elections
in
some
way
or
people
will
be
buying
votes
or
things
like
that
so
i
guess
i
start
by
pointing
out
that
political
event
markets
have
existed
forever
in
unregulated
forms
but
also
in
other
democracies
and
i
do
think
there
a
feeling
in
those
places
that
somehow
the
existence
of
these
markets
affects
the
integrity
of
elections
then
there
good
research
in
the
records
showing
that
this
kind
of
manipulation
is
not
remotely
plausible
i
found
the
comment
from
the
center
for
effective
altruism
particularly
helpful
at
this
point
that
at
pages
1427
to
1436
of
the
record
kind
of
take
each
aspect
of
the
election
manipulation
arguments
and
unpack
them
one
at
a
time
and
explain
why
they
wrong
at
that
time
most
basic
level
i
think
the
key
point
is
that
people
try
to
influence
elections
because
they
matter
they
matter
for
our
lives
they
matter
for
their
economic
effects
but
for
lots
of
other
reasons
and
so
there
lots
of
money
and
effort
spent
on
influencing
elections
that
what
campaign
finance
fights
are
all
about
and
there
a
way
in
which
you
might
think
that
some
of
that
icky
or
you
have
the
same
reaction
that
spending
money
to
try
to
get
elections
is
icky
but
i
think
it
important
here
to
point
out
how
much
money
and
how
many
incentives
there
are
in
these
elections
because
it
makes
manipulation
seem
pretty
darn
unlikely
particularly
as
your
honor
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
that
this
is
a
contract
about
control
of
congress
i
think
this
is
another
place
where
that
point
is
relevant
so
it
not
particularly
relevant
to
the
statutory
analysis
but
on
the
public
interest
piece
if
you
asking
what
the
public
interest
here
we
looking
at
this
specific
contract
and
asking
whether
there
a
serious
public
interest
harm
on
the
other
side
if
there
some
possibility
that
having
a
regulated
event
contract
market
as
opposed
to
the
unregulated
ones
that
already
exist
could
result
in
manipulation
of
control
of
congress
it
just
pretty
hard
to
imagine
i
think
if
there
were
a
way
to
manipulate
control
of
congress
someone
would
have
tried
it
hard
to
imagine
that
the
event
contract
market
could
change
all
of
the
profound
incentives
that
already
exist
it
sort
of
circles
back
to
the
initial
point
that
elections
matter
they
have
real
life
consequences
and
that
why
people
try
to
impact
elections
i
think
the
record
is
pretty
clear
that
the
possibility
of
manipulation
is
just
pure
speculation
that
there
not
evidence
supporting
that
sort
of
intuition
that
you
came
up
with
at
the
beginning
that
there
something
that
feels
a
little
bit
strange
about
that
one
last
point
i
think
the
commission
suggested
too
it
would
have
to
police
elections
if
it
approved
these
contracts
my
response
to
that
is
just
the
agency
regulates
contracts
that
have
underlying
events
of
all
kinds
so
an
event
contract
on
power
plant
emissions
does
mean
the
cftc
has
to
become
the
epa
all
of
a
sudden
and
regulate
power
plant
emissions
in
the
same
way
that
an
event
contract
that
has
to
do
with
stock
prices
does
turn
it
into
the
scc
all
the
agency
does
is
the
same
thing
it
does
in
any
other
context
it
just
regulates
the
market
not
the
underlying
activity
so
insomuch
as
that
the
other
aspect
of
this
that
there
a
concern
about
manipulation
and
there
a
concern
about
the
agency
and
what
it
would
have
to
do
as
a
result
i
think
there
no
real
reason
to
worry
that
its
role
would
be
any
different
here
than
it
is
in
any
other
context
the
court
do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
what
your
colleague
was
saying
when
i
asked
the
question
about
the
particular
safeguards
that
your
client
has
put
into
place
and
obviously
deemed
important
for
example
the
one
that
sticks
out
is
well
if
you
a
paid
member
of
a
congressional
staff
then
you
obviously
can
not
trade
these
contracts
and
there
are
other
safeguards
that
were
put
into
place
but
as
i
understand
your
position
the
commission
would
reach
that
because
it
not
enumerated
in
the
statute
so
there
would
be
no
public
interest
inquiry
and
so
those
kind
of
conditions
or
safeguards
would
not
be
required
nor
is
the
fact
that
this
is
an
election
contract
involving
control
of
the
house
particularly
relevant
a
dcm
could
have
this
event
contract
for
the
upcoming
presidential
election
right
so
those
things
that
you
point
to
as
evidence
of
well
there
are
safeguards
in
place
and
this
is
about
control
of
congress
that
not
really
relevant
to
the
statutory
question
correct
ms
rice
you
right
that
it
not
part
of
the
statutory
question
it
is
relevant
to
the
public
interest
analysis
if
you
get
that
far
if
you
assume
that
we
lose
on
the
statutory
analysis
which
we
do
think
is
the
right
answer
here
but
if
you
get
to
public
interest
so
this
is
a
gaming
contract
or
unlawful
activity
contract
then
you
looking
at
the
public
interest
and
it
is
relevant
the
kinds
of
safeguards
we
have
in
place
and
the
fact
that
this
is
a
contract
involving
the
court
i
guess
that
my
point
if
under
your
reading
you
would
get
to
the
public
interest
so
that
my
point
the
commission
would
have
no
ability
or
interest
in
considering
the
fact
that
a
contract
did
have
such
a
safeguard
mr
roth
i
did
want
to
cut
you
off
but
i
had
to
ask
my
colleague
who
actually
knows
the
statutory
framework
better
the
court
okay
mr
roth
what
he
clarified
for
me
was
that
there
are
separate
antifraud
provisions
anti
manipulation
provisions
and
what
they
call
the
core
principles
that
you
have
to
comply
with
and
so
that
where
some
of
these
other
safeguards
come
from
it
just
not
from
this
particular
statute
sorry
i
did
mean
to
rice
no
no
no
the
court
let
me
just
make
sure
i
understand
you
saying
it
not
implicated
by
this
statutory
provision
that
at
issue
in
the
lawsuit
but
as
part
of
this
scheme
generally
there
other
safeguards
and
these
are
statutory
from
the
commission
meaning
that
you
have
to
comply
with
these
provisions
mr
roth
right
that
right
the
court
okay
ms
rice
that
all
consistent
with
my
understanding
and
there
some
stuff
in
the
record
on
this
too
pages
80
to
88
of
the
ja
and
99
to
100
we
talk
about
the
core
principles
and
the
kind
of
background
rules
in
place
just
to
be
a
regulated
market
that
this
cftc
regulates
you
have
to
have
these
protections
you
listed
out
the
specific
people
that
are
allowed
to
trade
and
all
of
that
is
exactly
right
but
there
is
separately
and
for
all
contracts
a
prohibition
on
any
insider
with
any
non
public
information
trading
on
these
contracts
so
that
in
addition
to
the
specifically
enumerated
categories
the
court
that
makes
sense
and
that
applies
to
any
of
these
event
contracts
ms
rice
exactly
to
everything
so
where
there
is
insider
trading
or
manipulation
the
agency
has
the
tools
to
go
out
and
investigate
those
things
they
just
not
relevant
to
the
statutory
analysis
in
the
first
instance
if
that
makes
sense
unless
you
have
anything
further
your
honor
i
just
wrap
up
by
reiterating
that
i
do
think
you
need
to
get
to
public
interest
but
if
you
do
you
still
should
vacate
the
order
as
arbitrary
and
capricious
the
court
i
do
have
another
question
i
do
know
whose
so
i
will
let
whoever
answer
this
there
is
something
in
the
commission
brief
that
i
thought
was
it
this
point
unlike
many
hedging
and
risk
management
contracts
the
payout
on
the
contract
at
issue
here
is
not
in
any
way
tied
to
actual
or
estimated
losses
incurred
elsewhere
and
a
loss
on
the
contracts
is
not
offset
by
a
gain
elsewhere
i
just
thought
that
was
interesting
and
wanted
your
response
to
that
ms
rice
i
do
think
that
as
unusual
as
the
commission
makes
out
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
immediately
is
the
temperature
related
contracts
i
think
that
works
in
the
same
way
that
that
not
a
gain
or
a
loss
necessarily
it
not
clear
even
which
way
that
cuts
there
may
well
be
other
examples
but
my
immediate
reaction
to
that
is
i
do
think
that
particularly
unusual
in
this
context
the
court
i
learning
more
about
this
market
through
this
case
but
this
whole
futures
market
it
seems
to
me
it
grown
beyond
the
days
in
which
only
those
who
are
interested
in
the
commodity
or
directly
affected
are
participating
i
mean
that
the
case
for
all
these
contracts
right
ms
rice
that
true
of
all
the
contracts
in
fact
instruments
to
make
money
is
actually
necessary
for
the
markets
i
think
as
the
commission
order
i
think
acknowledges
some
amount
of
speculation
or
people
who
are
investing
in
these
to
be
liquid
because
if
it
was
just
hedgers
if
it
was
100
percent
hedgers
you
do
actually
get
someone
willing
to
balance
out
the
price
and
sell
you
or
buy
from
you
at
the
other
side
so
there
are
people
in
all
of
these
market
who
do
have
a
direct
hedging
interest
but
the
hedging
piece
of
it
is
certainly
meaningful
and
potentially
more
meaningful
in
this
context
than
many
of
the
others
the
court
is
there
anything
else
you
want
to
say
about
their
economic
purpose
test
i
trying
to
see
what
the
daylight
between
the
two
parties
is
with
respect
to
that
test
and
how
it
applied
ms
rice
so
i
think
we
agree
that
the
commission
has
discretion
to
consider
the
economic
impacts
of
these
contracts
that
this
statue
and
these
instruments
are
about
economic
benefits
i
think
where
we
diverge
is
the
commissions
focus
on
sort
of
two
things
one
is
direct
effects
as
opposed
to
indirect
effect
we
talked
about
and
the
other
is
this
predominately
hedging
or
more
than
occasional
hedging
the
court
that
what
i
meant
ms
rice
the
language
shifts
in
the
order
and
i
think
the
difference
probably
matters
occasional
sounds
to
me
like
something
less
than
predominant
i
not
entirely
clear
which
one
the
commission
is
advocating
for
so
i
think
part
of
the
problem
with
that
standard
is
that
it
not
clear
what
it
means
whether
it
means
a
certain
number
of
uses
how
many
dollars
are
going
to
be
spent
in
a
hedging
way
is
it
a
proportion
of
uses
is
it
some
combination
of
the
two
and
how
much
is
occasional
i
do
know
that
you
need
to
get
into
that
your
honor
because
i
think
by
any
metric
the
record
shows
there
will
be
more
than
occasional
uses
here
but
i
think
those
are
the
two
points
on
which
we
really
disagree
not
on
whether
economic
benefits
are
relevant
the
court
the
same
question
i
do
really
understand
there
to
be
a
dispute
about
my
standard
of
review
here
and
what
the
applicable
review
framework
is
ms
rice
i
agree
with
that
your
honor
there
was
some
back
and
forth
about
rule
making
cases
versus
adjudication
cases
ultimately
the
standard
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
for
both
there
are
more
rule
making
cases
and
this
proceeding
is
a
bit
unusual
in
that
there
were
formal
comments
accepted
and
considered
which
does
turn
it
into
a
formal
rule
making
that
never
been
our
argument
but
it
looks
a
little
bit
more
formal
than
informal
adjudication
does
but
you
right
that
the
standard
is
the
same
the
court
all
right
thank
you
ms
stukes
good
afternoon
your
honor
to
reintroduce
myself
i
ann
stukes
on
behalf
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
as
we
did
in
our
briefs
i
going
to
refer
to
my
agency
today
as
the
cftc
or
the
commission
and
i
refer
to
the
plaintiff
simply
as
kalshi
i
have
about
an
hour
worth
of
remarks
for
your
honor
today
if
that
is
okay
with
you
the
court
we
may
take
just
a
court
reporter
break
at
some
point
so
i
let
you
get
started
ms
stukes
thank
you
any
time
you
want
me
to
jump
to
an
issue
please
just
let
me
know
the
court
could
i
just
ask
you
something
i
curious
about
to
start
ms
stukes
absolutely
sure
the
court
with
respect
to
this
catchall
category
the
commission
specifically
did
make
an
argument
that
this
contract
falls
within
the
catchall
and
i
was
just
curious
as
to
i
not
saying
it
does
i
just
curious
as
to
why
that
was
the
position
of
the
commission
ms
stukes
in
considering
the
case
that
was
before
it
the
commission
examined
these
contracts
and
determined
that
two
categories
applied
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
statute
and
therefore
did
reach
any
further
categories
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
so
as
the
court
is
aware
the
cftc
order
that
at
issue
in
this
case
determined
under
cea
section
5cc5c
i
call
it
5cc5c
i
talking
about
the
same
statutory
language
that
codified
at
7
78
2
the
cea
is
like
many
statutes
sort
of
odd
where
sometimes
our
statutory
sections
do
line
up
with
the
codification
in
any
event
the
order
at
issue
here
determined
under
cea
5cc5c
that
kalshi
proposed
congressional
control
contracts
should
not
be
offered
on
kalshi
platform
because
the
commission
determined
that
those
contracts
were
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
commission
decision
was
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
commission
decision
addressed
four
principle
issues
that
the
parties
have
briefed
and
i
will
discuss
today
first
how
does
the
word
involve
apply
to
activities
enumerated
in
the
statute
second
do
these
proposed
contracts
involve
the
enumerated
activity
of
gaming
third
do
the
contracts
involve
the
enumerated
activity
of
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
and
four
are
the
contracts
contrary
to
public
interest
before
i
get
into
the
substance
of
each
of
these
issues
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
commission
order
is
an
informal
adjudication
and
your
honor
just
asked
about
the
standard
of
review
this
is
not
a
rule
making
and
it
not
even
a
formal
adjudication
and
that
means
in
practical
terms
that
the
commission
was
deciding
just
one
issue
whether
these
particular
proposed
contracts
should
be
listed
on
kalshi
event
contracts
platform
and
the
commission
did
purport
to
address
any
other
question
larger
than
that
so
for
instance
the
order
does
establish
the
full
metes
and
bounds
of
how
the
statute
might
apply
to
any
other
event
contract
other
than
the
ones
that
were
before
it
the
court
and
just
for
my
own
information
is
it
typical
for
the
commission
to
solicit
comment
in
a
circumstance
like
this
ms
stukes
it
not
required
it
did
so
i
think
in
an
abundance
of
caution
the
court
is
that
an
unusual
event
or
not
unusual
ms
stukes
i
do
want
to
say
something
misleading
especially
without
talking
to
my
colleagues
about
how
frequently
have
we
done
this
i
wish
i
had
a
better
answer
for
your
honor
the
court
it
more
out
of
my
curiosity
ms
stukes
i
can
see
why
i
think
the
commission
did
it
really
in
an
abundance
of
caution
because
of
public
interest
associated
with
this
topic
generally
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
i
emphasizing
that
this
is
an
informal
adjudication
because
when
your
honor
considers
the
question
before
you
which
is
rather
the
commission
ran
afoul
of
what
required
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
the
standard
of
review
is
a
lenient
one
the
law
requires
only
that
the
agency
acted
within
a
zone
of
reasonableness
here
the
cftc
reasonably
considered
the
relevant
issues
and
reasonably
explained
its
position
and
no
more
was
required
under
the
apa
the
apa
gives
the
agency
deference
on
its
predictive
judgments
and
on
its
public
interest
determination
now
there
are
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
in
this
case
and
your
honor
finds
herself
maybe
in
the
unenviable
position
of
having
each
party
in
this
case
tell
you
the
statute
is
unambiguous
that
the
plain
meaning
advocated
by
each
side
supports
each
side
i
submit
that
the
commission
has
the
better
of
the
argument
on
what
the
statute
means
and
how
it
applies
on
involve
gaming
and
unlawful
under
state
law
that
the
court
review
on
the
statutory
interpretation
questions
is
de
novo
i
get
into
now
the
first
of
the
four
issues
that
are
before
the
court
that
are
briefed
in
the
party
papers
and
that
is
the
commission
reading
of
the
word
involve
to
have
its
ordinary
meaning
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
as
an
essential
feature
a
consequence
these
are
the
ordinary
dictionary
definitions
of
the
term
and
that
is
the
definition
that
applies
because
the
term
involved
is
the
the
term
involve
is
not
defined
in
the
statute
and
so
case
law
has
held
for
a
long
time
that
when
there
when
the
statute
does
define
the
term
its
ordinary
meaning
applies
and
that
means
the
ordinary
meaning
in
dictionaries
so
what
that
means
for
the
statute
here
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
involve
when
we
talking
about
the
categories
enumerated
in
the
statute
that
would
render
an
event
contract
eligible
for
public
interest
review
the
word
involve
is
broad
enough
by
its
plain
meaning
to
cover
event
contracts
whose
underlying
meaning
the
event
on
which
the
contract
is
premised
here
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
contracts
where
whose
underlying
involved
the
enumerated
activity
as
well
as
contracts
that
relate
closely
entail
or
have
as
their
essentially
feature
or
consequence
the
enumerated
activity
the
court
i
do
understand
the
plaintiff
to
necessarily
disagree
with
the
definition
that
you
set
forward
but
i
think
when
you
say
that
closely
relates
to
or
entails
they
saying
yes
to
the
subject
matter
or
underlying
activity
of
the
contract
so
can
you
just
speak
to
that
because
i
had
thought
initially
that
there
was
some
difference
with
how
you
were
defining
involve
and
now
having
heard
from
plaintiff
and
going
back
and
reading
their
brief
reviewing
those
portions
of
the
brief
i
now
see
more
clearly
what
they
were
saying
that
those
definitions
have
to
relate
to
the
activity
at
issue
underlying
the
contract
so
if
you
could
just
speak
directly
to
that
ms
stukes
that
is
generally
my
understanding
of
the
dispute
between
the
parties
here
and
that
is
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff
and
not
to
mischaracterize
but
as
i
understand
the
plaintiff
position
they
saying
involve
if
it
means
anything
it
has
to
mean
that
the
underlying
event
involves
an
enumerated
activity
and
it
ca
be
a
broader
relationship
involving
the
contract
itself
so
when
we
look
at
the
statutory
language
and
whether
a
contract
is
in
the
scope
of
the
pardon
me
of
the
statute
at
all
it
a
two
step
inquiry
so
the
first
step
in
the
statutory
language
is
does
the
agreement
contract
transaction
or
swap
in
an
excluded
commodity
that
is
based
upon
based
upon
that
means
the
underlying
based
upon
the
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
so
step
one
in
other
words
asks
is
the
contract
based
on
does
it
is
it
based
on
is
the
underlying
an
event
because
this
pardon
me
this
statute
applies
only
to
event
contracts
so
step
one
under
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
which
uses
based
upon
meaning
underlying
in
the
same
sentence
that
it
uses
involve
step
one
is
is
this
an
event
contract
at
all
is
the
underlying
an
event
if
so
we
in
the
statute
at
least
this
far
step
two
is
whether
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
the
enumerated
activity
and
that
a
broader
question
than
whether
just
the
underlying
event
involves
the
enumerated
activities
based
on
as
used
in
the
statute
unambiguously
refers
to
the
underlying
event
it
must
be
an
event
that
all
involve
is
broader
any
aspect
of
the
contract
transaction
or
agreement
if
it
involves
an
enumerated
activity
we
submit
that
by
the
plain
meaning
of
the
word
involve
it
in
the
statute
at
least
it
gets
you
so
far
as
to
be
eligible
that
the
relationship
between
the
contract
and
the
enumerated
activities
if
the
contract
transaction
or
agreement
involves
the
enumerated
activity
we
in
the
statute
underlying
what
the
contract
is
based
upon
what
the
actual
event
is
can
be
can
the
underlying
can
involve
the
enumerated
activities
they
fairly
easy
to
think
of
examples
if
the
event
contract
is
based
upon
whether
a
war
will
break
out
it
in
an
enumerated
activity
the
court
is
there
an
example
of
a
contract
that
under
this
broader
definition
that
you
advocating
for
would
involve
war
where
the
underlying
activity
in
the
contract
does
speak
to
war
itself
ms
stukes
the
examples
are
the
examples
of
how
a
contract
could
involve
war
but
not
involve
an
act
of
war
have
to
do
and
i
think
both
parties
cite
this
kind
of
example
will
i
hate
to
give
these
real
world
examples
will
a
foreign
body
be
able
to
use
weapons
on
its
enemy
soil
something
like
that
that
involves
oh
gosh
i
do
want
to
get
too
in
the
weeds
will
funding
be
allocated
to
a
country
that
at
war
that
involves
war
the
court
i
think
they
would
say
yes
ms
stukes
i
actually
do
think
we
too
off
base
on
that
i
think
the
real
dispute
between
the
parties
is
what
are
you
looking
at
what
has
to
involve
the
enumerated
activities
and
the
real
rub
here
is
that
the
commission
interprets
the
plain
language
of
this
statute
to
say
if
transacting
in
the
contracts
if
the
feature
or
purpose
of
these
contracts
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
gambling
is
the
one
gaming
pardon
me
is
the
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
transacting
in
the
contract
is
that
essential
feature
gaming
and
the
commission
here
said
yes
for
gaming
and
for
unlawful
under
state
law
the
court
so
what
is
your
best
argument
for
their
response
that
there
are
a
lot
of
states
and
they
listed
them
for
me
that
make
any
type
of
betting
stakes
on
any
contingent
event
unlawful
under
state
law
such
that
that
what
these
event
contracts
are
so
every
event
contract
should
theoretically
if
the
transaction
of
the
contract
in
and
of
itself
is
what
involve
means
and
not
the
underlying
activity
at
issue
in
the
contract
than
just
the
mere
transacting
event
contracts
would
violate
state
law
how
do
you
respond
to
that
ms
stukes
i
want
to
say
two
things
about
that
and
i
can
jump
to
the
discussion
of
how
we
analyzed
unlawful
under
state
law
the
commission
is
not
saying
that
involve
in
every
instance
means
anything
other
than
its
plain
meaning
let
me
say
that
in
a
little
more
with
a
little
better
articulation
involve
is
a
broad
term
it
broad
enough
to
cover
event
contracts
whose
underlying
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
it
broad
enough
to
cover
an
event
contract
whose
essential
feature
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
here
an
essential
feature
of
these
contracts
is
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
the
court
but
an
essential
feature
of
some
other
contract
could
be
betting
or
wagering
on
fill
in
the
blank
ms
stukes
right
so
your
honor
concern
i
think
is
the
plaintiff
argument
what
do
we
do
with
this
what
i
interpret
as
an
extrapolation
from
what
the
commission
actually
said
to
say
well
that
would
be
absurd
in
another
context
because
other
state
laws
say
it
unlawful
there
are
state
laws
that
say
it
unlawful
to
wager
on
any
contingent
event
and
that
would
sweep
in
every
event
contract
to
a
public
interest
review
the
court
right
ms
stukes
so
i
just
getting
to
my
notes
where
i
have
this
the
court
sure
take
your
time
ms
stukes
the
commission
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
these
contracts
which
involve
wagering
on
elections
involve
activity
under
state
law
here
we
have
numerous
state
laws
that
forbid
wagering
on
elections
and
that
was
sufficient
for
the
commission
to
say
state
law
forbids
wagering
on
elections
that
the
essential
feature
of
these
contracts
and
we
can
stop
there
what
the
commission
did
do
is
say
state
law
forbids
or
makes
unlawful
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
that
was
not
the
basis
of
the
commission
reasoning
and
even
if
you
can
say
if
a
is
to
b
then
c
is
to
d
like
some
logical
extrapolation
that
not
what
the
commission
did
here
it
just
said
we
see
under
state
law
that
wagering
on
elections
is
unlawful
and
that
the
essential
feature
of
these
contracts
and
that
enough
that
enough
that
we
in
the
zone
of
the
statute
the
court
right
but
ms
stukes
and
it
not
unreasonable
i
sorry
i
interrupted
your
honor
the
court
i
just
wanted
to
because
right
now
i
think
we
talking
about
what
the
meaning
of
the
terms
in
the
statute
are
and
their
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
commission
reading
does
make
sense
this
is
otherwise
unambiguous
and
they
applying
this
word
in
a
way
that
kind
of
means
one
thing
in
one
subsection
and
another
in
another
subsection
and
what
they
saying
is
elections
is
not
on
this
enumerated
list
and
that
full
stop
end
of
case
and
you
saying
well
no
it
fits
under
the
first
category
because
betting
on
or
wagering
on
elections
violates
many
state
laws
and
their
response
is
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
violates
many
state
laws
and
if
that
were
the
reading
if
that
how
the
statute
was
read
that
would
mean
that
every
event
contract
would
be
subject
to
this
two
step
review
which
was
not
the
intent
when
the
statute
was
amended
to
streamline
this
process
and
not
make
the
dcm
have
to
make
an
initial
showing
that
the
contract
was
in
the
public
interest
so
i
just
speaking
more
about
the
unlawful
under
state
law
what
does
that
mean
does
that
mean
that
the
act
of
trading
the
contract
is
unlawful
under
state
law
in
which
case
that
would
might
relate
to
many
contracts
or
all
event
contracts
or
does
the
underlying
activity
for
example
i
think
plaintiff
gave
an
example
whether
or
not
some
crime
was
going
to
occur
whatever
it
is
some
specific
criminal
activity
where
the
subject
of
the
contract
relates
to
involves
something
that
is
unlawful
so
i
just
want
to
understand
the
difference
your
response
to
that
that
your
reading
would
put
every
event
contract
under
this
inquiry
ms
stukes
respectfully
i
do
believe
that
what
the
commission
held
in
this
order
would
subject
every
event
contract
because
what
the
commission
said
is
only
that
examining
these
contracts
whose
essential
feature
is
to
bet
on
elections
that
involves
activity
that
many
state
laws
prohibit
what
the
commission
did
not
say
is
these
contracts
involve
wagering
on
a
contingent
event
and
many
state
laws
make
wagering
on
a
contingent
event
unlawful
therefore
it
is
the
court
hypothetically
let
say
i
a
plaintiff
i
a
dcm
i
want
to
post
my
event
contract
about
whether
or
not
a
hurricane
will
hit
in
florida
and
the
commission
came
back
and
said
this
is
against
public
interest
and
it
also
falls
under
i
doing
this
out
of
order
it
falls
under
category
one
because
in
florida
and
elsewhere
the
state
law
prohibits
people
from
posting
or
making
bets
or
wagering
on
contingent
events
and
a
hurricane
is
a
contingent
event
and
this
contract
involves
a
wager
on
a
contingent
event
so
we
not
going
to
allow
it
would
that
be
allowed
under
this
statute
would
that
work
ms
stukes
i
think
it
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
the
statute
the
court
and
why
ms
stukes
and
it
because
this
statute
sets
forth
in
broad
terms
the
categories
that
are
the
subject
of
public
interest
review
and
none
of
those
categories
on
their
face
suggest
that
congress
intended
to
capture
all
event
contracts
and
it
the
court
right
that
their
point
i
think
that
exactly
what
they
saying
ms
stukes
i
think
actually
the
parties
agree
i
think
where
we
off
is
the
commission
does
agree
that
that
what
it
concluded
in
this
case
it
concluded
that
state
laws
forbid
wagering
on
elections
and
that
an
important
state
interest
that
kalshi
is
asking
the
commission
to
undermine
by
allowing
these
contracts
to
trade
on
a
federally
registered
exchange
a
federally
regulated
exchange
to
be
clear
the
commission
order
did
find
that
like
if
these
contracts
were
allowed
it
did
find
that
purchasing
one
of
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
illegal
in
jurisdictions
that
prohibit
betting
on
elections
by
statute
or
common
law
kalshi
argues
that
the
commission
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
fell
afoul
of
the
law
because
it
ca
be
illegal
under
state
law
to
offer
the
contracts
on
a
market
regulated
by
the
cftc
because
fransha
ph
but
that
as
the
commission
held
in
its
order
misses
the
point
the
cea
is
a
federal
statutory
regime
for
the
regulation
of
commodities
derivatives
markets
and
it
does
preempt
state
laws
that
prohibit
the
trading
of
commodities
contracts
no
state
law
can
ban
a
contract
that
lawfully
listed
on
a
cftc
regulated
market
but
what
kalshi
asks
the
commission
to
do
here
and
what
kalshi
is
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
order
the
cftc
to
permit
these
contracts
when
kalshi
own
website
cites
news
articles
that
characterize
them
repeatedly
as
election
gambling
betting
on
elections
when
under
state
law
it
illegal
to
gamble
on
elections
and
this
by
the
way
is
the
reason
we
here
if
kalshi
could
lawfully
offer
election
betting
contracts
on
cftc
markets
it
could
ignore
any
state
law
that
disallows
election
gambling
even
states
that
allow
gambling
prohibit
betting
on
elections
and
that
indicates
that
the
concern
is
not
so
much
gambling
but
election
integrity
you
ca
place
a
bet
on
an
election
in
las
vegas
or
atlantic
city
for
the
cftc
to
allow
the
contracts
it
would
have
had
to
undermine
these
important
state
interests
and
so
when
the
commission
concluded
in
its
order
that
in
considering
whether
a
contract
involves
activity
under
state
law
it
considered
whether
the
activity
is
unlawful
under
state
laws
that
are
not
otherwise
preempted
by
the
cftc
laws
that
go
to
state
interest
that
are
not
overlapping
with
the
cea
regulatory
authority
and
when
the
commission
considers
that
it
can
consider
whether
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
commodities
markets
federal
commodities
derivatives
markets
should
be
used
to
subvert
important
state
interests
so
this
question
of
well
it
frustrating
to
me
i
an
advocate
i
should
be
frustrated
by
my
opponent
arguments
but
what
frustrating
to
me
about
that
is
this
concept
that
the
commission
interpretation
of
the
statute
does
make
sense
because
some
state
laws
make
it
illegal
to
place
a
wager
on
any
contingent
event
it
a
distraction
it
not
what
the
commission
held
here
the
commission
went
as
far
as
it
needed
to
go
because
this
is
an
informal
adjudication
it
one
case
under
a
different
set
of
facts
and
a
different
proposed
contract
it
might
look
to
that
language
it
would
be
an
unusual
reading
of
the
statute
to
say
because
many
state
laws
prohibit
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
that
all
event
contracts
are
unlawful
it
would
be
an
usual
reading
of
a
statute
that
sets
forth
only
enumerated
categories
the
court
i
think
they
would
agree
with
that
ms
stukes
right
i
think
we
agree
on
that
the
court
well
i
do
think
you
want
to
agree
on
if
you
do
want
to
agree
on
that
i
think
you
want
to
distinguish
that
from
the
election
ms
stukes
no
what
i
am
saying
is
the
commission
did
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
state
laws
that
make
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
unlawful
the
commission
based
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
state
laws
that
make
election
wagering
unlawful
it
did
consider
in
its
decision
and
it
did
base
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
these
other
broader
state
laws
and
so
it
does
even
factor
in
to
the
review
here
whether
they
exist
or
not
it
was
the
basis
for
the
commission
decision
and
even
if
you
can
extrapolate
what
the
commission
was
not
doing
here
the
commission
was
ruling
here
it
went
only
as
far
as
it
needed
to
go
to
decide
the
issue
before
it
i
hope
that
that
is
coming
through
to
your
honor
so
here
because
these
contracts
have
as
their
essential
feature
not
that
they
wagering
on
any
contingent
event
but
they
are
wagering
on
the
outcome
of
elections
and
wagering
on
elections
is
unlawful
under
numerous
state
laws
the
commission
was
reasonable
in
its
determination
that
these
contracts
fit
within
that
category
of
unlawful
under
state
law
to
render
them
at
least
in
the
statute
in
subsection
i
can
move
on
to
talk
about
gaming
unless
you
want
to
talk
about
the
court
let
talk
about
gaming
ms
stukes
okay
again
with
the
term
gaming
the
commission
applied
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
gaming
to
conclude
that
these
contracts
would
fall
within
that
enumerated
category
again
gaming
is
not
a
defined
term
in
the
statute
and
so
what
the
commission
did
reasonably
is
look
to
its
ordinary
meaning
as
defined
in
dictionaries
and
in
ordinary
meanings
as
defined
in
state
law
and
federal
law
well
i
talk
about
that
in
a
second
and
concluded
that
it
falls
within
the
ordinary
that
those
proposed
contracts
which
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
fall
within
the
meaning
of
gaming
first
the
commission
looked
at
that
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
of
gaming
and
found
that
gaming
in
its
ordinary
dictionary
meaning
is
synonymous
or
interchangeable
with
gambling
and
that
actually
supported
in
the
congressional
record
when
we
see
that
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
where
the
first
thing
i
think
that
senator
lincoln
comment
says
is
this
section
of
the
cea
5cc5c
is
intended
to
prevent
gambling
using
the
futures
markets
for
gambling
the
court
how
do
you
define
gambling
ms
stukes
let
me
come
back
to
the
definition
so
gaming
in
ordinary
dictionary
definitions
is
synonymous
with
gambling
there
actually
a
supreme
court
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
also
for
that
proposition
they
interchangeable
terms
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
so
what
gambling
the
commission
looked
at
various
definitions
under
state
law
of
how
gambling
is
defined
and
a
common
thread
in
many
state
law
definitions
of
gambling
is
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
it
within
a
common
thread
a
frequently
used
phrasing
included
in
the
definition
of
gambling
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
a
number
of
states
linked
the
terms
gaming
or
gambling
to
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
the
commission
also
looked
at
this
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
which
has
the
definition
of
to
bet
or
wager
betting
or
wagering
is
a
common
definition
of
gambling
and
in
that
statute
wagering
on
a
contest
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
is
included
in
the
definition
the
court
can
i
ask
you
a
question
ms
stukes
yeah
absolutely
the
court
besides
elections
in
your
view
is
there
a
contest
of
others
that
does
involve
a
game
as
plaintiff
would
define
what
game
means
ms
stukes
i
actually
thought
the
horse
race
was
a
game
but
there
are
contests
academy
awards
award
types
of
things
that
does
seem
like
a
game
just
seems
like
a
contest
so
the
court
okay
so
an
event
contract
on
something
about
one
of
these
awards
would
fall
under
the
gaming
or
gambling
prong
ms
stukes
first
of
all
i
do
want
to
get
ahead
of
my
commission
which
the
commission
did
define
it
define
did
talk
about
whether
the
in
this
order
did
get
into
other
examples
because
it
was
sufficient
to
determine
that
elections
fall
within
this
ordinary
definition
of
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
the
court
right
i
trying
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
what
the
terms
mean
in
the
statute
so
it
certainly
relevant
for
me
to
understand
how
this
would
apply
even
beyond
this
case
while
i
know
i
only
looking
at
the
order
in
this
case
so
based
on
what
you
said
an
event
contract
about
any
kind
of
contest
like
an
award
show
academy
award
grammy
ms
stukes
it
not
a
game
it
seems
like
a
contest
the
court
that
would
fall
under
the
gaming
prong
ms
stukes
wagering
on
it
it
sounds
look
it
might
yeah
the
court
keep
going
ms
stukes
so
one
of
the
criticisms
that
kalshi
levies
at
the
commission
decision
here
is
they
say
that
the
definition
is
gerrymandered
because
it
includes
only
wagering
something
or
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
and
gaming
can
be
so
much
more
than
that
gaming
can
be
games
gaming
can
be
so
much
more
than
that
what
the
commission
did
however
is
it
looked
at
what
are
these
contracts
these
contracts
are
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
elections
does
that
fit
in
an
ordinary
definition
of
gaming
we
submit
yes
because
gaming
is
interchangeable
with
gambling
and
ordinary
meaning
of
gambling
is
to
stake
something
of
value
on
a
contest
of
others
and
an
election
is
a
contest
by
its
plain
meaning
dictionary
definitions
define
contest
to
include
elections
the
examples
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
talk
about
the
presidential
election
as
a
contest
the
presidential
contest
meaning
an
election
so
gaming
reasonably
and
plainly
includes
by
its
plain
meaning
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
contest
of
others
this
might
not
be
to
the
exclusion
of
other
types
of
gaming
and
gambling
that
were
not
at
issue
in
this
particular
matter
but
these
contracts
are
designed
to
wager
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
elections
the
court
but
the
definitions
do
change
based
on
the
contract
at
issue
right
the
statute
says
what
it
says
ms
stukes
the
statute
says
what
it
says
the
court
and
it
your
role
to
determine
whether
you
undertake
this
type
of
review
under
the
statute
then
you
decide
or
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
contract
fits
the
definition
so
the
definition
does
change
it
whether
the
contract
fits
the
definition
so
it
ca
be
i
not
going
to
find
gambling
means
contest
here
and
then
in
another
case
be
given
a
different
definition
from
the
commission
about
what
gambling
might
mean
based
on
the
contract
at
issue
there
that
not
what
you
suggesting
ms
stukes
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
because
this
is
not
a
rule
making
that
the
commission
determination
of
whether
these
contracts
fit
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
did
not
require
the
commission
to
define
gaming
entire
universe
for
it
to
determine
that
these
contracts
fit
within
an
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
the
court
i
guess
that
what
i
having
difficulty
with
because
what
i
hearing
you
say
is
that
there
could
be
many
definitions
and
we
pick
the
one
applicable
here
if
there
are
many
definitions
i
hope
no
one
is
asking
me
to
find
this
is
an
ambiguous
statute
this
is
not
the
time
to
deal
with
ambiguities
in
statutory
interpretation
so
i
guess
i
mean
i
hope
that
the
commission
is
taking
the
position
that
gaming
means
x
and
that
this
contract
fits
x
because
of
whatever
argument
you
not
saying
that
you
adding
a
contest
here
but
in
other
circumstance
you
use
another
dictionary
definition
there
should
be
a
definition
that
applies
that
unambiguous
ms
stukes
what
the
commission
found
here
is
an
ordinary
definition
of
gaming
includes
wagering
on
a
contest
of
others
because
and
that
not
as
kalshi
puts
it
gerrymandering
the
court
i
can
accept
that
ms
stukes
that
deciding
what
before
it
the
court
i
can
accept
that
in
the
dictionary
there
may
be
one
two
three
and
if
it
fits
any
of
those
prongs
i
just
want
to
know
the
extent
of
what
the
definition
of
gambling
is
under
the
commission
view
so
what
you
saying
is
it
includes
this
contest
of
others
and
so
because
an
election
in
your
view
is
a
contest
of
others
then
betting
or
wagering
on
that
violates
that
provision
of
the
statute
ms
stukes
or
at
least
brings
it
into
that
enumerated
category
of
the
statute
yes
the
court
okay
but
if
there
are
other
definitions
of
gambling
and
i
losing
track
of
whether
i
saw
it
myself
or
whether
it
in
the
papers
but
that
would
just
say
for
example
you
might
have
said
it
earlier
betting
or
wagering
on
a
contingent
event
ms
stukes
on
any
contingent
event
the
court
on
any
contingent
event
would
that
mean
that
every
event
contract
involves
gambling
and
thus
gaming
ms
stukes
that
not
what
the
commission
held
here
and
it
unlikely
to
be
what
the
commission
would
hold
in
another
context
if
it
came
up
but
that
was
the
question
presented
here
so
what
was
presented
here
was
do
these
contracts
which
are
routinely
characterized
as
election
betting
contracts
fall
within
the
ordinary
meaning
an
ordinary
meaning
of
gaming
where
gaming
is
synonymous
with
gambling
and
gambling
includes
wagering
on
a
contest
of
others
and
a
contest
of
others
includes
elections
and
that
was
enough
the
court
okay
ms
stukes
to
be
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
we
talked
about
gaming
and
unlawful
under
state
law
and
involve
and
unless
your
honor
wants
to
talk
further
about
any
of
those
subissues
i
can
move
on
to
the
public
interest
the
court
sure
yes
please
ms
stukes
okay
so
having
determined
that
kalshi
proposed
contracts
involve
two
enumerated
activities
under
the
statute
the
commission
proceeded
to
determine
that
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
public
interest
and
therefore
are
prohibited
from
trading
and
in
making
this
determination
the
commission
considered
the
contract
economic
purpose
as
well
as
other
factors
so
i
start
with
the
economic
purpose
evaluation
so
the
parties
point
this
out
in
our
briefs
but
our
statute
here
the
cea
codifies
two
public
interests
in
commodities
markets
hedging
and
price
discovery
so
hedging
in
general
means
to
use
the
commodity
derivatives
markets
to
manage
risk
of
price
fluctuations
in
commodities
for
example
we
put
in
our
brief
an
example
of
an
airline
they
have
to
buy
jet
fuel
to
operate
their
business
and
they
have
a
price
sensitivity
to
movements
in
the
price
of
jet
fuel
so
a
market
participant
who
wants
to
hedge
their
risk
of
price
fluctuations
and
they
worried
that
the
price
of
a
commodity
will
go
up
will
hedge
that
risk
by
entering
into
a
commodity
derivatives
contract
whose
value
will
go
up
if
the
price
of
that
commodity
increases
so
in
other
words
hedging
means
you
can
enter
into
a
derivatives
contract
in
a
cftc
regulated
market
that
will
move
in
your
financial
interest
if
the
commodity
that
you
sensitive
to
moves
against
your
financial
interest
that
hedging
price
discovery
which
is
the
other
enumerated
public
interest
in
the
cea
and
in
commodity
derivatives
markets
generally
means
to
determine
a
price
level
for
a
commodity
based
upon
its
pricing
in
a
cftc
regulated
market
so
for
instance
futures
contracts
on
like
agricultural
commodities
can
be
used
the
trading
on
futures
contracts
can
be
used
to
discover
the
price
of
the
actual
commodity
in
the
cash
market
as
noted
in
the
order
the
commission
considered
the
public
interest
of
kalshi
proposed
contracts
and
considered
their
economic
purpose
so
this
statute
5cc5c
does
define
what
it
means
to
consider
the
public
interest
but
because
the
cea
itself
codifies
economic
interests
in
the
years
before
2000
when
the
cftc
examined
every
derivatives
contract
for
public
interest
it
looked
at
an
economic
purpose
test
that
asked
whether
a
contract
can
be
reasonably
expected
to
be
or
has
been
used
for
hedging
or
price
basing
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
that
was
the
test
and
the
cftc
looked
at
that
test
in
considering
whether
these
proposed
contracts
have
an
economic
purpose
and
the
cftc
also
mentioned
this
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
which
senator
feinstein
asked
if
the
commission
would
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominate
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative
as
opposed
to
hedging
or
economic
use
so
the
commission
cited
both
of
these
formulations
of
considering
the
economic
purpose
of
the
contracts
in
evaluating
these
proposed
contracts
and
it
considered
comments
that
kalshi
highlighted
for
your
honor
that
congressional
control
has
economic
effects
and
it
considered
comments
from
commenters
that
said
they
would
use
these
contracts
to
hedge
but
as
the
commission
found
the
economic
effects
of
one
chamber
of
congress
or
another
are
the
word
the
commission
used
is
diffuse
and
unpredictable
the
price
of
these
contracts
is
not
correlated
to
the
price
of
any
commodity
and
so
the
price
of
the
contracts
could
reasonably
or
predictably
be
used
to
establish
commercial
transaction
prices
for
hedging
or
discovery
the
court
can
i
get
a
clarification
is
the
test
is
it
the
more
than
occasional
language
or
is
it
the
predominantly
for
commercial
purpose
ms
stukes
the
test
the
commission
evaluated
both
it
looked
at
both
and
found
that
even
considering
the
comments
that
suggested
pardon
me
that
these
contracts
would
be
used
for
hedging
purposes
most
of
the
comments
suggested
that
the
hedging
uses
were
not
really
related
to
the
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
but
rather
the
ultimate
changes
in
law
or
policy
that
could
be
affected
many
steps
down
the
line
from
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
so
even
taking
all
the
commenters
together
who
stated
an
intent
to
hedge
economic
risk
by
trading
these
contracts
it
did
establish
that
the
contracts
would
be
used
for
hedging
on
more
than
an
occasional
basis
but
even
if
there
were
robust
economic
purposes
for
these
contracts
the
economic
purpose
of
the
contracts
was
just
one
aspect
of
the
evaluation
here
because
a
contract
with
economic
purpose
an
event
contract
even
if
it
has
an
economic
purpose
it
does
make
it
per
se
in
the
public
interest
there
an
example
actually
in
the
colloquy
of
the
congressional
record
you
can
have
a
contract
on
whether
a
terrorist
event
will
occur
and
it
could
be
used
for
hedging
even
if
you
going
to
suffer
an
economic
consequence
from
that
it
does
make
it
in
the
public
interest
it
does
make
it
a
good
idea
so
the
commission
here
considered
the
alleged
economic
purposes
of
these
contracts
and
it
found
that
these
contracts
could
not
because
control
of
a
single
chamber
of
congress
the
impact
for
economic
hedging
is
so
diffuse
there
are
so
many
steps
that
are
involved
between
the
election
and
actual
enactment
of
legislation
that
the
economic
purpose
of
these
contracts
did
not
weigh
in
favor
of
their
public
interest
but
it
considered
other
aspects
too
i
want
to
address
one
thing
that
kalshi
argues
that
the
commission
imposed
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
direct
effects
test
stating
that
these
contracts
do
have
a
direct
economic
effect
simply
because
a
single
chamber
of
congress
does
itself
have
the
power
to
enact
law
is
not
an
arbitrary
test
it
a
description
of
the
limited
hedging
utility
that
these
contracts
would
have
but
again
even
if
these
contracts
had
a
robust
economic
purpose
other
factors
play
in
to
the
public
interest
determination
and
they
did
here
so
i
talk
about
election
integrity
unless
your
honor
would
like
to
talk
about
the
economic
purpose
the
court
i
guess
the
only
question
is
plaintiff
made
an
argument
in
their
briefs
and
i
talked
to
them
a
little
today
about
even
putting
aside
any
legislation
that
passed
just
the
mere
fact
of
elections
that
dictate
who
is
in
control
of
what
chamber
has
maybe
impact
on
the
stock
market
or
other
direct
economic
consequences
that
are
real
and
tangible
and
that
can
be
observed
in
the
aftermath
of
elections
and
i
wanted
to
know
what
your
response
was
to
that
ms
stukes
my
response
is
maybe
something
you
already
said
which
is
even
if
there
are
economic
benefits
to
trading
these
contracts
the
commission
determined
in
its
discretion
that
those
were
not
outweighed
by
the
very
serious
public
interest
the
court
so
you
do
dispute
that
ms
stukes
i
find
that
even
if
it
true
it
does
make
a
difference
because
the
commission
was
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
in
its
determination
that
the
concerns
about
election
integrity
here
overwhelmingly
are
reasonable
and
not
arbitrary
or
capricious
the
court
okay
let
go
to
the
election
integrity
ms
stukes
so
factors
including
specific
concerns
about
election
integrity
supported
the
commission
determination
that
the
contracts
were
contrary
to
public
interest
and
the
principal
concerns
that
the
commission
identified
included
that
these
contracts
could
create
monetary
incentives
for
individuals
or
organized
groups
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
for
financial
gain
to
win
a
bet
not
the
court
and
before
you
said
to
win
a
bet
i
was
thinking
you
describing
what
i
think
happens
now
in
real
life
in
terms
of
the
financial
incentives
of
people
putting
money
behind
elections
and
what
motivates
people
to
vote
for
certain
candidates
is
often
financial
in
nature
right
but
you
saying
specifically
to
collect
on
these
event
contracts
ms
stukes
these
event
contracts
their
very
existence
would
establish
could
establish
a
financial
incentive
to
vote
in
a
particular
way
that
does
presently
exist
because
these
contracts
are
not
traded
anywhere
you
ca
gamble
on
elections
so
they
can
incentivize
voting
in
particular
ways
that
could
influence
how
people
vote
the
court
how
would
we
ever
measure
that
ms
stukes
well
the
the
court
the
reason
i
asking
is
because
i
think
the
plaintiff
argument
is
that
concern
is
so
unlikely
to
happen
it
and
i
thought
that
they
made
a
good
argument
today
that
there
are
already
so
many
incentives
financial
and
otherwise
behind
elections
that
motivate
people
to
do
certain
things
i
mean
the
point
being
that
if
there
were
some
way
to
get
control
over
a
if
someone
could
figure
out
a
way
to
ensure
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
that
probably
would
have
happened
by
now
right
so
what
is
your
response
to
that
ms
stukes
my
response
is
the
existence
of
a
federally
regulated
derivatives
contract
on
the
outcome
of
elections
could
incentivize
people
to
manipulate
either
that
contract
or
the
election
itself
for
financial
gain
i
give
you
some
examples
to
talk
about
the
kind
of
thing
we
concerned
about
and
i
skipping
ahead
to
the
order
i
was
going
to
talk
with
you
about
these
things
the
commission
is
not
just
a
regulatory
agency
we
also
a
law
enforcement
agency
and
we
tasked
under
the
cea
with
antifraud
authority
and
we
tasked
under
the
cea
to
ensure
integrity
in
the
markets
that
we
oversee
and
because
of
that
the
commission
could
be
drawn
in
to
investigating
manipulative
conduct
in
these
markets
in
a
way
that
does
outside
of
its
ordinary
mission
so
here
an
example
a
political
activist
with
a
big
social
media
following
they
float
a
rumor
on
social
media
damaging
to
a
candidate
who
is
important
to
one
party
control
of
the
senate
in
a
couple
of
weeks
this
rumor
spins
up
and
spins
out
and
it
turns
out
maybe
it
untrue
it
turns
out
to
be
false
but
during
the
weeks
that
the
rumor
was
circulating
the
congressional
control
contract
on
the
other
party
goes
up
and
many
people
make
a
lot
of
money
by
selling
that
contract
when
the
market
is
high
and
then
the
cftc
gets
a
tip
and
says
well
that
person
put
that
rumor
on
social
media
in
order
to
manipulate
the
congressional
control
contract
there
a
couple
of
implications
here
the
very
availability
of
that
contract
has
added
one
more
reason
and
maybe
a
big
reason
for
some
people
to
disseminate
false
information
about
elections
and
that
certainly
relevant
to
the
public
interest
another
thing
that
the
commission
considered
here
is
that
it
would
draw
the
commission
into
investigating
these
kinds
of
activities
and
that
not
farfetched
the
court
is
that
something
that
the
commission
is
tasked
with
doing
now
i
assuming
there
are
other
contract
i
probably
could
come
up
with
an
example
of
any
contract
that
could
be
subject
to
some
manipulation
where
there
money
involved
is
that
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
commission
would
typically
investigate
if
there
was
an
issue
with
okay
ms
stukes
absolutely
your
honor
as
a
federal
regulator
of
commodities
markets
the
cftc
as
i
said
is
in
charge
of
ensuring
price
integrity
on
our
federally
regulated
exchanges
in
the
ordinary
course
there
many
ways
to
manipulate
markets
now
i
say
this
in
the
same
breath
that
i
say
i
think
the
markets
regulated
by
the
cftc
are
among
the
safest
in
the
rule
but
the
limit
of
manipulation
is
really
just
the
limit
of
human
ingenuity
manipulation
is
attempted
and
the
cftc
as
a
law
enforcement
agency
routinely
investigates
allegations
of
fraud
and
manipulation
in
the
markets
that
it
oversees
the
court
i
asked
that
because
when
i
read
your
brief
it
sounded
like
one
of
the
arguments
you
were
making
was
that
if
you
had
to
do
that
in
this
circumstance
it
would
put
you
in
a
position
that
the
cftc
is
not
equipped
to
do
but
it
sound
like
if
it
part
of
your
regular
mission
it
would
put
you
in
a
position
that
you
not
already
required
or
routinely
do
ms
stukes
my
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that
there
are
two
important
differences
because
this
is
not
a
minimal
concern
it
not
simple
enough
to
say
oh
but
you
investigate
manipulation
in
markets
that
you
not
an
expert
in
all
the
time
and
it
true
we
have
a
division
of
enforcement
that
investigates
alleged
manipulation
in
a
lot
of
markets
on
a
lot
of
commodities
the
difference
here
there
are
two
important
differences
first
and
most
important
any
government
investigation
and
enforcement
activity
involving
the
political
process
is
inherently
sensitive
there
a
difference
in
the
cftc
investigating
economic
activity
related
to
commodity
derivatives
markets
and
the
cftc
investigating
acts
that
may
be
political
speech
or
other
conduct
central
to
the
political
process
second
as
we
briefed
and
as
the
commission
found
in
its
order
most
of
the
markets
regulated
by
the
cftc
have
objective
economic
data
that
may
not
totally
decide
a
case
but
at
a
minimum
it
provides
some
objective
grounding
through
the
cftc
investigations
of
whether
manipulation
has
occurred
the
vast
potential
of
these
contracts
to
incentivize
misinformation
could
absolutely
draw
the
commission
into
investigations
of
a
vast
array
of
possible
manipulation
the
pricing
of
these
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
impacted
by
such
a
broad
array
of
information
anything
that
could
influence
the
election
could
influence
the
price
of
these
contracts
so
polls
rumors
news
announcements
faked
information
advertisement
i
ca
even
think
of
it
all
and
this
would
be
for
every
congressional
race
in
the
country
kalshi
does
have
jurisdiction
to
investigate
any
alleged
manipulation
on
these
contracts
it
would
fall
to
the
cftc
in
its
everyday
operation
the
cftc
receives
tips
of
possible
market
manipulation
and
it
would
be
drawn
into
investigating
whether
information
disseminated
about
congressional
elections
illegally
manipulated
the
market
in
these
contracts
and
that
is
not
a
role
for
which
the
commission
is
equipped
and
it
would
greatly
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
cftc
assuming
the
role
of
an
election
cop
raises
very
serious
concerns
about
not
only
the
misalignment
of
that
role
with
the
commission
mission
and
its
history
but
with
election
integrity
and
it
was
reasonable
for
the
cftc
to
have
considered
this
as
another
example
it
not
farfetched
it
not
a
de
minimus
concern
kalshi
says
oh
it
not
a
big
deal
you
do
that
anyway
or
it
not
likely
to
happen
the
commission
predicted
judgment
based
upon
its
existence
as
a
law
enforcement
agency
that
routinely
investigates
manipulation
and
as
a
regulatory
agency
that
is
entrusted
with
ensuring
the
integrity
of
its
markets
it
was
a
reasonable
predictive
judgment
to
say
that
that
would
draw
the
cftc
into
investigating
conduct
that
relates
to
elections
there
another
example
there
another
example
i
wanted
to
talk
with
your
honor
about
and
that
would
be
you
asked
kalshi
counsel
about
the
limits
that
it
proposed
to
put
on
who
could
trade
these
contracts
as
far
as
i
read
that
list
it
would
prohibit
people
who
count
the
votes
from
trading
in
these
contracts
so
imagine
a
scenario
and
the
position
limits
meaning
how
much
can
be
traded
on
these
contracts
the
position
limits
proposed
would
allow
trading
of
up
to
5
million
if
you
a
company
or
entity
so
imagine
a
group
of
poll
workers
and
i
do
mean
people
that
are
involved
in
surveys
i
mean
people
that
count
the
votes
they
form
a
company
of
some
kind
and
they
accused
of
putting
their
money
together
and
putting
a
5
million
position
on
these
congressional
control
contracts
these
are
the
people
counting
the
votes
someone
refers
this
to
the
cftc
because
they
think
the
vote
counting
has
been
manipulated
to
make
a
profit
in
the
event
contract
so
here
would
be
the
cftc
being
drawn
into
whether
the
vote
count
is
accurate
the
court
or
whether
there
was
fraud
in
connection
with
the
event
contract
right
ms
stukes
correct
because
it
would
ask
the
question
of
whether
there
was
fraud
in
the
event
contract
because
that
would
be
manipulating
manipulative
or
fraudulent
conduct
that
unduly
influenced
the
event
contract
and
that
an
example
of
the
cftc
concern
because
these
contracts
could
their
very
existence
could
incentivize
conduct
designed
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
for
the
purpose
of
manipulating
the
price
of
the
contract
for
financial
gain
or
they
could
incentivize
the
manipulation
of
the
market
for
the
purpose
of
artificially
affecting
the
election
or
perceptions
of
the
election
i
want
to
mention
one
thing
that
kalshi
talks
about
and
that
is
oh
actually
before
i
get
there
research
in
the
record
one
comment
submitted
in
the
record
involved
the
actual
manipulation
of
a
political
event
contract
by
false
information
there
was
it
a
bizarre
fact
pattern
the
pop
singer
kid
rock
was
shown
to
be
ahead
in
the
polls
in
a
match
up
against
a
sitting
senator
before
he
had
ever
he
had
not
even
declared
a
candidacy
for
the
senate
but
he
was
shown
in
a
poll
to
be
ahead
of
a
sitting
senator
and
that
caused
the
price
of
a
corresponding
event
contract
to
drop
and
it
caused
trading
volume
to
surge
and
users
were
later
on
social
media
bragging
about
how
that
poll
trolled
the
news
media
and
influenced
the
election
event
contract
researchers
have
theorized
that
that
kind
of
fake
information
could
be
used
to
generate
market
movement
in
other
election
event
contracts
so
it
not
farfetched
to
say
that
this
is
a
serious
concern
over
600
comment
letters
were
received
by
the
agency
including
from
senators
and
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
expressing
significant
concerns
about
election
integrity
and
the
improper
commodification
of
our
elections
and
i
do
say
commodification
just
as
rhetorical
flourish
when
you
have
an
event
contract
trading
on
a
cftc
regulated
market
and
the
underlying
event
of
that
contract
is
an
election
the
election
is
a
commodity
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
where
a
large
number
of
states
have
specifically
disallowed
gambling
on
elections
by
either
statute
or
common
law
and
that
reflects
the
view
of
a
large
number
of
states
that
this
kind
of
wagering
is
against
the
public
interest
the
commission
grants
significant
weight
to
any
threat
to
election
integrity
as
well
as
the
threat
to
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
this
is
especially
important
at
a
point
in
time
where
so
many
people
question
the
validity
of
elections
the
commission
is
not
required
to
let
threats
to
election
integrity
happen
before
recognizing
election
integrity
as
a
public
interest
concern
with
respect
to
these
contracts
there
one
other
value
that
kalshi
argues
that
kalshi
and
amici
and
commenters
argue
that
these
contracts
have
and
that
is
that
they
could
provide
beneficial
market
based
predictive
data
and
that
that
societally
valuable
information
the
commission
considered
that
but
it
did
find
that
generation
of
such
data
outweighed
the
very
real
and
grave
concerns
about
the
threat
to
election
integrity
that
these
contracts
would
pose
the
cftc
predictive
judgment
about
possible
negative
consequences
that
could
arise
from
these
proposed
contracts
are
entitled
to
deference
under
apa
law
the
commission
did
ignore
evidence
it
did
refuse
to
engage
with
contrary
positions
it
found
that
any
economic
utility
of
the
contracts
did
outweigh
the
very
serious
risks
that
the
contracts
could
be
manipulated
and
could
incentivize
the
spread
of
misinformation
or
be
used
to
undermine
election
integrity
or
the
perception
of
election
integrity
so
for
all
of
these
reasons
the
cftc
submits
that
your
honor
should
deny
kalshi
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
grant
judgment
to
the
cftc
the
court
okay
thank
you
any
brief
rebuttal
mr
roth
very
brief
very
very
brief
the
court
yes
mr
roth
i
appreciate
the
court
time
i
will
be
very
very
brief
three
quick
points
first
your
honor
asked
about
the
catchall
category
why
they
did
rely
on
the
catchall
the
court
yes
mr
roth
the
catchall
requires
a
rule
making
it
by
rule
or
regulation
they
have
done
a
rule
making
and
so
that
they
could
rely
on
the
catchall
the
court
they
could
not
rely
on
the
catchall
mr
roth
yes
so
they
would
first
have
to
do
a
rule
making
to
determine
some
activity
is
similar
to
the
others
they
have
not
done
that
so
that
the
answer
to
that
the
court
thank
you
i
appreciate
that
mr
roth
on
unlawful
i
still
did
not
really
hear
a
theory
as
to
why
their
reading
does
sweep
in
everything
what
i
heard
was
you
do
have
to
worry
about
that
because
that
not
this
case
that
not
how
statutory
interpretation
works
we
need
to
understand
what
the
statute
means
counsel
admitted
that
a
de
novo
question
for
this
court
to
consider
and
of
course
in
considering
what
the
statute
means
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
how
it
would
apply
in
other
contexts
that
does
mean
you
need
to
figure
out
the
answer
to
every
other
hypothetical
case
that
might
exist
but
the
supreme
court
whenever
it
considering
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
looks
at
how
it
going
to
apply
elsewhere
and
if
it
going
to
be
absurd
in
a
wide
variety
of
other
cases
that
means
it
a
bad
interpretation
that
i
think
covers
unlawful
the
only
thing
i
say
about
gaming
to
add
to
earlier
your
honor
asked
if
their
interpretation
of
contests
would
sweep
in
anything
that
is
a
game
other
than
elections
and
counsel
response
was
potentially
awards
shows
like
who
going
to
win
the
emmy
or
the
oscar
which
i
thought
was
a
fascinating
example
because
kalshi
offers
those
and
has
offered
those
for
a
long
time
and
they
have
never
subjected
those
to
the
review
process
and
i
think
that
really
underscores
the
sort
of
outcome
driven
aspect
of
this
it
not
a
good
faith
statutory
interpretation
it
an
attempt
to
get
it
in
without
a
real
coherent
theory
of
what
the
statute
means
that
all
i
have
your
honor
unless
you
have
further
questions
the
court
no
thank
you
i
appreciate
the
briefs
were
very
good
and
helpful
and
i
appreciate
your
time
before
we
leave
i
going
to
embarrass
franklin
because
this
is
my
courtroom

in
person
