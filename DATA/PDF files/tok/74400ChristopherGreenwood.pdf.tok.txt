the
proposal
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
has
provided
several
questions
regarding
the
proposal
that
relate
in
large
part
to
the
public
interest
as
a
longstanding
market
maker
of
exchange
traded
derivative
instruments
we
believe
that
the
public
interest
would
be
very
much
served
by
the
exchange
providing
a
regulated
market
to
trade
the
contracts
in
the
proposed
manner
the
reasons
supporting
our
views
are
provided
below
as
an
initial
matter
several
of
the
cftc
questions
regarding
the
potential
listing
of
the
contracts
relate
to
whether
the
contracts
constitute
gaming
as
referenced
in
cftc
rule
while
we
defer
to
the
arguments
submitted
by
the
exchange
and
legal
experts
on
this
issue
we
would
note
that
our
understanding
of
gaming
is
that
it
involves
an
activity
wherein
a
person
typically
a
gambler
a
casino
or
a
sportsbook
takes
on
financial
risk
as
an
inherent
part
of
the
person
gambling
operations
and
unrelated
to
any
other
business
activity
by
contrast
the
contracts
at
issue
offer
genuine
hedging
opportunities
by
providing
persons
typically
businesses
involved
in
industries
unrelated
to
gambling
a
financial
market
solution
to
alleviate
financial
risk
and
uncertainty
arising
outside
of
their
day
to
day
operations
by
trading
that
risk
with
a
third
party
without
otherwise
affecting
those
day
to
day
business
operations
the
value
of
a
derivatives
product
stems
largely
from
its
ability
to
offer
a
hedge
against
unwanted
risk
when
a
regulated
derivates
market
makes
such
a
product
available
the
public
generally
benefits
in
this
case
the
listing
of
the
contracts
provides
significant
direct
and
indirect
benefits
to
the
public
as
it
offers
the
most
efficient
method
of
hedging
the
numerous
risks
associated
with
one
party
winning
control
of
congress
instead
of
another
the
most
efficient
method
of
hedging
the
numerous
risks
associated
with
one
party
winning
control
of
congress
instead
of
another
as
other
commentors
have
explained
market
participants
already
regularly
adjust
their
trading
strategies
in
response
to
electoral
outcomes
as
different
governments
have
substantially
different
policies
while
there
is
some
uncertainty
regarding
the
exact
manifestation
of
specific
policies
the
contracts
allow
a
market
participant
and
the
market
as
a
whole
to
forecast
the
implications
associated
with
one
party
political
agenda
and
then
react
to
the
possible
outcome
of
an
election
indeed
the
directional
effect
of
a
given
government
on
commodity
and
security
prices
can
be
and
is
predicted
for
example
one
political
party
with
a
majority
control
of
congress
may
be
more
likely
than
another
to
impose
either
more
strict
or
more
lenient
environmental
regulations
that
would
respectively
raise
or
reduce
operational
costs
associated
with
certain
energy
industries
if
the
risk
of
increased
regulatory
costs
is
great
enough
businesses
and
suppliers
in
the
energy
sector
could
alleviate
the
potential
cost
increase
by
trading
a
contract
with
a
party
more
willing
to
bear
that
risk
similarly
a
given
political
party
may
be
more
or
less
likely
to
approve
new
expenditures
such
as
infrastructure
projects
than
another
market
participants
relying
upon
congressional
spending
in
that
sector
could
use
the
contracts
to
hedge
the
risk
of
gaining
or
losing
this
anticipated
source
of
funding
plainly
changes
in
government
result
in
myriad
regulatory
consequences
which
in
turn
pose
a
quantifiable
risk
to
many
different
market
participants
our
experience
over
decades
in
the
financial
industry
suggests
that
traditional
instruments
are
insufficient
to
fully
hedge
the
risk
that
arise
from
these
fluctuations
in
federal
policy
many
products
do
not
have
future
markets
associated
with
them
for
example
in
the
agriculture
space
most
fruits
and
vegetables
do
not
have
a
futures
market
as
such
market
participants
that
face
idiosyncratic
policy
risk
are
forced
to
use
imperfect
exchange
traded
products
that
do
not
fully
reduce
their
unwanted
risk
the
contracts
on
the
other
hand
can
be
used
to
efficiently
hedge
business
risks
in
the
same
manner
as
other
successfully
listed
hedging
products
that
is
once
the
excess
business
risk
associated
with
one
party
political
agenda
has
been
identified
by
the
customer
it
can
be
efficiently
transferred
to
another
party
more
willing
and
able
to
manage
the
risk
indeed
when
a
farmer
uses
a
listed
future
to
hedge
a
crop
harvest
or
a
financial
institution
uses
a
listed
future
to
hedge
a
portfolio
of
investment
products
the
same
general
risk
management
goal
applies
to
those
instances
as
it
would
to
a
business
that
will
hedge
using
the
contracts
on
the
exchange
the
ability
to
hedge
risk
also
enables
market
participants
to
operate
steadier
businesses
for
instance
a
public
works
contractor
concerned
about
the
above
hypothetical
change
in
infrastructure
spending
could
alleviate
that
risk
and
for
example
potentially
avoid
preemptive
layoffs
the
availability
of
the
contracts
on
the
exchange
likely
has
an
equally
beneficial
impact
on
broader
financial
markets
specifically
because
election
results
already
influence
the
way
that
market
participants
trade
the
prices
of
certain
commodities
and
securities
necessarily
react
to
an
anticipated
election
result
as
well
as
such
we
believe
that
by
allowing
market
participants
to
trade
positions
on
upcoming
elections
the
market
will
naturally
and
efficiently
determine
the
most
accurate
underlying
prices
associated
with
one
party
winning
over
another
these
prices
in
turn
provide
the
most
accurate
indicator
of
the
outcome
of
the
upcoming
elections
market
participants
likely
react
to
that
data
and
the
market
adjusts
the
prices
of
commodities
and
securities
that
would
be
impacted
by
the
election
accordingly
thus
while
no
specific
outcome
may
be
guaranteed
the
availability
of
this
data
often
results
in
more
efficiently
priced
commodities
and
securities
for
consumers
while
allowing
for
less
fluctuation
and
speculation
stated
differently
by
allowing
market
participants
to
trade
on
the
outcome
of
elections
the
actual
outcome
of
those
elections
would
have
a
minimized
impact
on
the
volatility
of
the
market
as
a
whole
because
that
outcome
will
be
priced
in
the
resulting
predictability
of
prices
benefits
both
market
participants
and
the
general
public
the
final
set
of
questions
posed
by
the
cftc
with
respect
to
the
contracts
concern
whether
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
while
many
other
commenters
have
weighed
in
regarding
the
social
significance
of
these
contract
hedging
utility
and
their
resistance
to
market
manipulation
sig
would
emphasize
the
importance
of
bringing
this
valuable
activity
under
a
us
based
regulatory
framework
vast
amounts
of
election
related
trading
already
occur
in
the
status
quo
often
on
unregulated
platforms
that
do
not
have
the
robust
oversight
and
protections
that
american
consumers
have
come
to
expect
or
on
other
overseas
markets
this
fact
should
not
only
highlight
the
clear
demand
that
exists
for
these
products
but
also
underscores
the
benefit
to
citizens
and
businesses
by
bringing
this
activity
to
the
onshore
regulated
and
taxed
market
approval
of
the
contracts
and
the
resulting
ability
for
market
participants
to
manage
their
own
risk
in
a
regulated
environment
would
provide
much
needed
market
protection
for
the
many
that
already
avail
themselves
of
these
hedging
tools
in
conclusion
sig
strongly
supports
the
cftc
approval
of
the
listing
of
the
contracts
and
believes
that
the
contracts
are
in
the
public
interest
as
they
are
an
innovative
product
that
provide
an
active
competitive
hedging
market
to
the
benefit
of
a
multitude
of
stakeholders
