about
railbird
railbird
aims

adjacent

industry
and

unique

management

and

solutions
to
market
participants
although
railbird
intends
to
work
with
the
commission
to
offer
unique
event
contracts
it
has
no
plans
to
offer
contracts
related
to
political
outcomes
in
its
request
for
comment
the
commission
put
forth
a
list
of
17
questions
this
comment
addresses
many
of
the
questions
raised
in

but
is
primarily
intended
to
address
questions
1

7
and
8
those
specifically
related
to
the
hedging
potential
for
kalshi
congressional
control
contracts
question
1
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
gaming
as
described
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
question
6
do
the
contracts
serve
a
hedging
function
are
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
based
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedged
directly
by
the
contracts
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrates
the
hedging
utility
of
the
contracts
question
7
are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
question
8
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
in
reviewing
the
contact
hedging
function
is
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
used
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrated
need
by
likely
hedgers
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
used
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participants
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedging
use
event
contracts
provide
an
innovative
and
targeted
hedging
tool
for
market
participants
event
contracts
serve
as
an
innovative
novel
and
targeted
method
for
individuals
and
companies
to
hedge
economic
risks
importantly
event
contracts
allow
participants
a
means
to
hedge
risk
that
is
not
otherwise
addressed
by
more
traditional
financial
instruments
given
the
unique
hedging
opportunity
that
such
contracts
provide
the
commission
should
reassess
its
finding
in
the
nadex
order
from
2012
that
political
control
contracts
do
not
provide
hedging
utility
to
market
participants
see
in

that
political

the

there
are
myriad
individuals
and
companies
that
could
utilize
kalshi
proposed
contracts
to
offset
the
potential
economic
impacts
of
one
party
controlling
congress
for
example
a
person
could
utilize
the
contracts
to
hedge
the
risk
associated
with
the
potential
passage
or
failure
of
legislation
championed
by
a
certain
party
politicians
make
clear
their
public
policy
priorities
prior
to
being
elected
and
public
policy
decisions
like
industry
specific
investment
or
changes
in
tax
have
significant
economic
impacts
commercial
entities
and
the
broader
public
should
be
allowed
the
ability
to
hedge
the
risks
associated
with
these
public
policy
decisions
more
broadly
the
commission
should
consider
that
event
contracts
enable
commercial
entities
and
the
public
to
more
directly
hedge
certain
economic
risks
rather
than
rely
on
proxies
that
may
not
adequately
address
the
risk
underlying
nature
for
example
consider
a
wheat
farmer
who
is
concerned
about
diminished
production
resulting
from
reduced
rainfall
the
farmer
could
indirectly
hedge
this
risk
using
the
wheat
existing
futures
market
but
that
hedge
would
not
address
impacts
to
production
volume
from
inclement
weather
an
event
contract
based
upon
rainfall
quantity
could
benefit
the
farmer
by
providing
a
hedge
that
more
directly
addresses
the
risk
of
variable
weather
similarly
although
the
likelihood
of
one
party
controlling
congress
may
be
obliquely
factored
into
the
futures
market
the
price
of
commodities
in
the
futures
markets
may
not
address
the
specific
risk
to
a
company
of
one
party
controlling
congress
event
contracts
have
other
benefits
in
addition
to
generating
new
hedging
opportunities
event
contracts
have
other
economic
and
social
benefits
that
the
commission
should
consider
when
assessing
the
public
interest
of
listing
event
contracts
as
the
commission
itself
has
recognized
event
contracts
including
the
congressional
control
contracts
have
the
ability
to
further
an

and
gauge

the

railbird
supports
commissioner
pham
interpretation
of
cea
section
and
cftc
rule
set
forth
in
her
dissenting
statement
on
kalshi
proposed
contracts
when
determining
whether
the
provisions
of
cea
section
apply
the
commission
should
assess
whether
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
involves
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
here
the
contracts
are
based
upon
the
underlying
activity
of
political
control
in
turn
we
share
commissioner
pham
view
that
political
control
is
not
gaming
and
that
the
commission
has
not
otherwise
promulgated
a
rule
or
regulation
to
determine
that
political
control
is
similar
to
one
of
the
activities
enumerated
under
cea
section
accordingly
we
support
commissioner
pham
reasoning
that
rules
and
2
do
not
apply
to
kalshi

conclusion
the
commission
has
recognized
that

facilitate

and
thereby
provide
potential
benefits
to
the

advancing

purpose
to
