i
live
in
the
baltimore
washington
area
my
wife
and
i
are
blessed
with
young
children
my
wife
is
a
who
is
active
at
a
prominent
hospital
i
am
an
attorney
whose
practice
involves
civil
rights
litigation
there
are
of
course
many
events
that
would
impact
my
family
economically
here
are
some
of
them
climate
change
related
events
such
as
extreme
weather
impacting
our
daily
lives
would
increase
our
costs
and
impact
us
significantly
changes
in
healthcare
funding
will
impact
my
wife
remuneration
and
importantly
her
work
environment
changes
to
medicare
funding
for
example
will
have
a
big
impact
changes
to
the
way
that
new
treatments
and
medications
are
approved
will
also
impact
her
work
she
has
developed
expertise
and
will
continue
to
stay
at
the
cutting
edge
of
patient
care
general
policy
changes
that
impact
healthcare
and
medical
ethics
such
as
many
of
the
ongoing
discussions
regarding
abortion
access
and
gender
reassignment
have
significant
ramifications
for
my
wife
work
changes
to
the
tax
code
such
as
child
tax
credits
child
care
deductions
and
fsas
will
affect
us
economically
criminal
justice
reforms
will
impact
my
practice
this
includes
a
plethora
of
potential
changes
many
of
these
changes
have
impacts
that
are
measurable
in
dollars
and
cents
such
as
changes
to
funding
tax
policy
and
certain
criminal
justice
reforms
many
others
are
intangible
such
as
many
of
the
climate
change
impacts
however
it
is
patently
obvious
that
these
impacts
have
economic
impact
from
the
violence
against
woman
act
all
the
way
though
the
current
understanding
of
the
importance
of
esg
and
diversity
and
inclusion
something
does
not
require
a
dollar
sign
in
front
of
it
to
have
a
substantial
and
significant
economic
impact
we
assign
a
value
to
these
impacts
based
on
our
own
research
and
determinations
we
also
determined
that
the
likelihood
of
these
events
occurring
is
different
depending
on
whether
there
is
democratic
republican
or
split
control
of
congress
my
family
risk
exposure
to
negative
economic
events
changes
depending
on
which
party
controls
congress
we
could
use
kalshi
contract
to
manage
these
risks
while
it
is
unlikely
that
we
would
hedge
to
the
point
that
we
risk
neutral
we
could
hedge
the
outcome
of
the
elections
to
lower
our
risk
profile
in
line
with
our
risk
tolerance
this
directly
and
generally
addresses
your
questions
6
9
on
that
i
have
two
additional
points
the
first
is
regarding
question
9
are
very
small
dollar
value
contracts
targeted
at
individual
retail
customers
likely
to
have
hedging
utility
for
such
customers
when
the
contracts
offer
positions
on
macro
level
national
political
events
the
answer
is
a
resounding
yes
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
one
could
consider
the
possibility
that
elections
in
general
let
alone
control
over
congress
do
not
affect
individuals
does
the
cftc
consider
it
remotely
possible
that
elections
only
impact
big
businesses
i
am
concerned
that
this
question
may
reflect
an
unconscious
bias
against
retail
customers
from
the
nation
most
important
financial
regulator
my
second
point
is
related
to
the
first
it
is
clear
that
the
correct
standard
should
be
whether
a
contract
can
be
used
for
hedging
not
will
be
used
for
hedging
here
is
why
if
the
cftc
insists
on
a
will
be
used
standard
the
cftc
will
perforce
be
making
a
judgment
on
how
i
as
a
market
participant
will
be
using
the
contract
that
is
not
the
cftc
job
i
am
competent
at
assessing
my
own
risk
my
assessment
will
likely
be
different
than
the
cftc
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
cftc
does
not
think
that
its
assessment
is
better
or
more
valid
than
mine
i
am
confident
the
cftc
would
agree
that
i
should
have
a
voice
in
determining
how
i
assess
and
manage
my
risk
as
such
questions
6
10
should
not
be
the
cftc
concern
in
closing
it
surprises
me
than
an
historically
diverse
commission
with
an
emphasized
commitment
to
esg
diversity
and
increasing
minority
access
to
markets
would
suggest
a
we
know
your
risks
better
than
you
do
approach
as
a
minority
i
respectfully
request
that
you
let
my
family
access
the
markets
too
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
my
public
comment
