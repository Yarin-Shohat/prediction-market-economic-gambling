dear
chairman
behnam
we
write
to
express
concern
regarding
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
commission
consideration
of
a
rulemaking
proposal
that
would
ban
the
offering
of
broad
categories
of
contracts
including
political
and
sports
based
event
contracts
as
members
of
the
senate
committee
on
agriculture
nutrition
and
forestry
we
want
to
ensure
that
the
cftc
rulemaking
process
continues
to
be
guided
by
proper
market
oversight
and
integrity
without
stifling
innovation
since
its
inception
the
cftc
has
been
the
global
standard
for
sound
derivatives
market
regulation
providing
certainty
to
market
participants
and
allowing
for
agriculture
producers
and
commodity
traders
alike
to
hedge
risk
through
a
wide
variety
of
practices
the
cftc
based
on
its
congressional
mandate
has
long
fostered
innovation
by
allowing
the
offering
of
novel
products
and
allowing
the
market
to
evaluate
the
utility
of
such
products
even
while
other
government
agencies
fall
short
for
this
reason
we
are
concerned
about
the
commission
proceeding
with
a
rule
that
may
limit
the
use
of
a
critical
investment
tool
elections
have
tangible
impacts
on
markets
and
the
businesses
of
derivatives
markets
users
and
political
event
contracts
can
serve
as
a
valuable
tool
to
protect
against
these
risks
these
markets
also
provide
valuable
data
on
trends
in
the
sentiment
of
the
voting
public
with
legitimate
public
and
academic
utility
other
emerging
asset
classes
such
as
sports
related
interests
have
expressed
needs
for
similar
risk
management
products
and
your
rulemaking
would
seemingly
prejudge
the
validity
of
those
products
as
well
furthermore
american
investors
have
demonstrated
a
clear
desire
to
participate
in
these
markets
and
it
is
far
preferable
that
they
do
so
on
platforms
that
benefit
from
the
oversight
and
protections
provided
by
the
american
regulatory
structure
the
cftc
prohibiting
the
use
of
these
markets
in
the
will
only
serve
to
drive
american
investors
to
participate
in
offshore
markets
where
they
are
left
with
inadequate
safeguards
just
as
our
farmers
benefit
from
key
agriculture
futures
contracts
listed
on
exchanges
serving
as
global
benchmarks
event
contracts
particularly
on
elections
should
be
subject
to
regulation
this
benefits
the
cftc
as
well
as
market
activity
taking
place
on
a
exchange
improves
the
cftc
ability
to
facilitate
a
well
functioning
market
if
we
turn
a
blind
eye
to
these
markets
the
cftc
has
no
say
in
the
integrity
and
customer
protection
requirements
it
is
not
a
typical
occurrence
for
the
cftc
to
place
a
blanket
restriction
on
multiple
asset
classes
through
a
single
rulemaking
and
we
feel
that
should
the
cftc
move
forward
with
such
a
proposal
it
should
be
done
with
an
abundance
of
public
feedback
we
would
recommend
that
the
cftc
beyond
its
typical
open
meeting
process
consider
a
hearing
or
public
roundtable
to
allow
the
public
to
offer
views
on
the
value
of
event
contracts
in
addition
the
timing
of
this
rulemaking
is
especially
concerning
as
the
cftc
is
still
engaged
in
multiple
lawsuits
related
to
political
event
contracts
a
blanket
ban
on
such
contracts
has
the
potential
to
inappropriately
influence
the
judicial
branch
consideration
of
these
issues
which
we
feel
is
an
improper
use
of
the
commission
regulatory
authority
and
sets
a
concerning
precedent
of
influencing
the
courts
through
regulation
as
you
consider
any
rulemaking
proposal
we
urge
you
to
consider
the
value
of
these
innovative
contracts
and
the
negative
consequences
of
banning
entire
classes
of
products
instead
of
considering
contracts
by
their
individual
merits
the
cftc
has
developed
a
well
earned
and
admirable
reputation
both
for
transparency
in
its
dealings
with
congress
and
the
markets
it
regulates
and
for
openness
to
innovation
including
in
novel
products
in
carbon
and
digital
asset
markets
especially
amid
ongoing
litigation
we
urge
you
to
continue
this
trend
and
engage
with
the
public
before
considering
any
blanket
ban
on
products
that
hold
value
to
the
american
people
thank
you
for
your
consideration
of
this
matter
