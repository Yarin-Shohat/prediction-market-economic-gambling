our

the
2020
presidential
election
garnered
notable
global
attention
from
market
participants
which
was
reflected
to
some
degree
in
immediate
changes
in
asset
prices
since
financial
markets
respond
rapidly
to
new
and
diverse
information
it
is
difficult
to
disentangle
any
one
event
impact
however
the
election
offers
a
unique
opportunity
to
overcome
this
identification
obstacle
major
results
came
in
overnight
a
sufficiently
small
window
that
concurrent
events
were
limited
in
scope
using
a
novel
data
source
to
get
minutely
estimates
of
probabilities
for
the
presidential
outcome
we
examine
the
relationship
between
the
2020
election
and
various
financial
markets
we
find
striking
correlations
between
the
presidential
election
outcome
probability
and
major
financial
indicators
including
usd
currency
pairs
bond
prices
stock
index
futures
and
a
market
volatility
measure
the
correlations
are
consistent
with
risk
on
behavior
in
markets
a
term
which
describes
investors
moving
toward
riskier
asset
classes
as
the
election
results
became
clearer
further
we
decompose
the
market
reaction
into
a
reduction
in
uncertainty
component
and
a
probability
of
a
democratic
party
presidency
component
this
decomposition
reveals
how
markets
reacted
to
the
increasing
certainty
of
the
outcome
as
election
results
came
in
finally
we
analyze
the
differing
market
reactions
to
the
presidential
election
and
the
senate
election
including
data
from
the
unique
georgia
runoffs
and
demonstrate
that
bond
prices
were
particularly
sensitive
to
the
probability
of
a
combined
democratic
senate
and
presidency
background
and
data
prediction
markets
offer
a
unique
source
of
data
on
political
and
economic
events
betting
on
elections
has
been
commonplace
since
at
least
the
late
1800s
rhode

2004
wolfers
2009
and
the
advent
of
the
internet
in
the
1990s
introduced
centralized

markets
with
many
users

these
markets
match
two
users
to
purchase
a
yes
and
no

for
a
contract
that
is

candidate
x
be
elected
at
a
price
ranging
from
0
to
1
in
an
efficient
market
the
resulting
price
of
a
yes
share
can
be
interpreted
as
the
probability
of
the
event
x
happening
for
example
if
the
price
of
a
yes
share
was
and
a
user
predicted
the
true
probability
of
the
event
to
be
the
user
would
buy
a
yes
share
making
an
expected
profit
of

if
many
buyers
expected
the
same
probability
of
the
price
of
the
yes
share
would
rise
closer
to
with
enough
users
and
enough
information
the
market
price
converges
to
the
expected
probability
of
the
event
occurring
since
the
popularization
of
these
betting
markets
in
the
1990s
there
has
been
considerable
research
on
their
utility

and
the

over

there
was
a
remarkable
shift
in
the

the

ranged
from

to

at

the
democratic

probability
of
winning
the

was
close

as

were
published
the
probability
fell
all
the
way
to

before
steadily
rebounding
late
into
the
night
these
large
shifts
reflect
two
factors
1
the
variable
times
at
which

reported
results
and
2
the
realization
of
a
large

of

early
in

others

this
trickle
of

provides
ample
time
for

to
adjust
their
perceptions
of
the

of
the

in
addition
it
became
obvious
that
expectations
about
the
election
outcome
which
strongly
favored
democrats
based
on
polls
had
been
inaccurate
the
actual
election
results
had
a
much

forced

financial
markets
and
the

there
are
several
potential
explanations
for
the
observed
co
movements
between
asset
prices
and
the
changing
presidency
probability
one
possibility
is
an
increasing
risk
on
sentiment
where
investors
are
more
willing
to
own
riskier
assets
in
exchange
for
higher
expected
return
evidence
for
such
a
rotation
is
in
the
declining
vix
futures
the
eme

strengthening
more
than
those
of
afes
and
the
tech
focused
nasdaq
index
being
the
most
positively
correlated
of
any
of
the
assets
in
our
sample
however
a
countervailing
piece
of
evidence
against
such
risk
on
behavior
is
the
negative
coefficient
in
the
10
year
treasury
yield
a
typical
risk
on
rotation
would
involve
an
increase
in
treasury
yields
as
investors
sell
off
these
extremely
safe
assets
instead
we
observe
a
negative
correlation
between
treasury
yields
and
the
democratic
presidency
probability
a
reduction
in
uncertainty
it
is
possible
that
markets
were
not
only
pricing
in
a
democratic
or
republican
victory
for
the
presidency
but
also
the
uncertainty
of
the
election
outcome
in
face
of
a
large
uncertain
event
financial
markets
may
respond
with
a
risk
off
stance
putting
investments
into
safer
assets
until
the
uncertainty
is
concluded
after
the
event
has
resolved
markets
then
take
on
more
risk
and
lower
their
expectation
of
future
volatility
this
pricing
in
of
uncertainty
is
clear
in
the
vix
futures
price
plotted
against
the
democratic
presidency
probability
in
panel
a
of
figure
3
the
simple
linear
regression
in
blue
has
a
fairly
strong
fit
to
the
data
as
demonstrated
by
its
r
squared
value
of
about
plotted
in
panel
however
by
adding
an
additional
variable
capturing
the
certainty
of
the
election
outcome
calculated
as
the
absolute
value
of
the
distance
from
50
50
odds
the
model
fit
of
a
specification
we
label
linear
certainty
is
even
higher
the
strength
of
the
relationship
is
also
visually
convincing
in
panel
a
of
figure
3
with
the
linear
certainty
model
plotted
with
the
red
line
this
suggests
that
to
some
extent
market
participants
were
responding
to
the
level
of
certainty
of
the
presidential
outcome
instead
of
the
outcome
itself
controlling
for
other
elections
earlier
we
noted
that
by
narrowing
the
time
window
to
election
night
we
were
reducing
the
probability
that
other
events
could
be
affecting
financial
markets
our
analysis
so
far
however
abstracts
from
a
host
of
other
elections
that
take
place
at
the
same
time
as
the
presidential
election
there
are
two
other
crucial
outcomes
control
of
the
senate
and
of
the
house
of
representatives
democrats
were
the
favorites
to
win
control
of
the
house
and
the
probability
of
that
outcome
did
not
move
much
over
the
course
of
the
night
ranging
from
88
to
99
control
of
the
senate
on
the
other
hand
moved
substantially
favoring
democrats
heading
into

and
completely

the
end
of

an

what
the

was

two

senate

are
shown
in
figure

which
paints
the
most
complete
picture
of
how
the
various
elections
of
2020
were
priced
in
by
markets
for
the
purposes
of
our
analysis
the
inclusion
of
the
trifecta
is
similar
to
adding
an
interaction
term
between
the
democratic
presidency
and
democratic
senate
probabilities
looking
first
at
the
vix
we
can
see
that
the
coefficient
on
presidential
certainty
captures
the
largest
amount
of
movement
in
the
financial
market
dependent
variables
with
the
democratic
presidency
probability
still
having
a
large
negative
effect
and
the
democratic
trifecta
probability
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
vix
it
is
likely
that
the
shock
effect
of
one
party
controlling
all
three
institutions
which
was
a
surprise
outcome
led
to
expectations
of
responsive
volatility
in
equity
markets
in
the
near
term
in
contrast
the
10
year
treasury
shows
a
decrease
in
yield
from
both
of
the
presidential
variables
as
is
consistent
with
the
results
in
figure
2
but
it
has
an
implied
increase
in
yield
from
the
democratic
senate
and
trifecta
probabilities
this
is
a
possible
sign
that
markets
interpreted
a
democratic
senate
and
even
more
so
a
trifecta
as
a
precursor
of
a
larger
round
of
stimulus
owing
to
a
unified
government
being
more
easily
able
to
pass

legislation
in

while
the

the
strongest

is

potential

differences
between
the
two
presidential
outcomes
the

and
control
of

the

election
left
the
senate
split
with
50
republican
seats
to
48
for
the
democrats
this
includes
the
two
independents
who
caucus
with
the
democrats
in
the
democratic
total
the
final
two
seats
were
both
in
georgia
as
no
candidate
won
50
of
the
vote
triggering
automatic
runoffs
that
would
decide
control
of
the
senate
with
democrats
only
needing
50
seats
to
hold
a
majority
using
the
vice
president
vote
to
break
ties
we
repeat
the
analysis
above
focusing
instead
on
january
5th
from
to
midnight
as
the
final
results
of
the
election
came
in
this
time
there
truly
was
only
one
election
outcome
two
races
and
the
result
was
unexpected
causing
a
steady
shift
in
the
odds
as
the
votes
were
tallied
in
panel
a
the
strong
relationship
between
the
democratic
senate
probability
and
the
10
year
treasury
price
is
apparent
the
strong
increase
in
the
vix
paints
a
picture
of
the
surprise
outcome
introducing
volatility
into
the
market
as
prices
adjust
in
addition
the
movements
may
reveal
an
expectation
of
a
larger
stimulus
package
because
of
the
prospect
of
a
unified
government
being
able
to
pass
bills
more
easily
consistent
with
results
in
figure
4
most
notably
the
implied
increase
in
the
10
year
treasury
is
quite
significant
and
aligns
well
with
this
story
on
the
textbook

conclusion
we
use

for
any

throughout

the
striking

show
that
prediction

shows
the
importance
