dear
kirkpatrick
gemini

together
with
its
subsidiaries
gemini
respectfully
submits
the
following
comments
on
proposed
rule
pr
8907
24
proposal
which
pertains
to
the
regulations
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
commission
pursuant
to
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
we
urge
the
commission
to
withdraw
the
proposal
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
proposal
is
contrary
to
the
statutory
framework
of
the
cea
and
as
a
substantive
matter
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
there
are
numerous
problems
with
the
proposal
but
we
focus
on
the
aspect
of
the
proposal
that
would
define
ipso
facto
all
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
particular
we
highlight
the
adverse
impact
that
this
rule
would
have
on
prediction
markets
including
prediction
markets
used
to
forecast
elections
first
the
proposal
ignores
the
framework
congress
defined
in
the
cea
the
cea
by
its
plain
text
prohibits
a
designated
contract
market
dcm
from
using
the
self
certification
process
to
list
an
event
contract
if
that
contract
is
within
one
of
five
enumerated
activities
and
if
the
commission
determines
that
listing
that
specific
event
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
see
7
thus
the
statuterequires
the
commission
to
evaluate
event
contracts
on
a
case
by
case
basis
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
including
in
the
dodd
frank
provisions
relating
to
event
contracts
stating
that
all
event
contracts
in
the
enumerated
activities
are
by
definition
contrary
to
the
public
interest
89
fr
at
48978
in
this
regard
we
note
that
the
cftc
has
stated
the
commission
interprets
cea
section
to
authorize
categorical
public
interest
determinations
if
the
commission
determines
that
contracts
involving
an
enumerated
activity
or
prescribed
similar
activity
are
as
a
category
contrary
to
the
public
interest
respectfully
this
is
just
wrong
and
the
proposal
is
based
on
an
overly
expansive
erroneous
reading
of
the
cea
put
simply
the
text
just
does
not
support
the
commission
interpretation
quoted
above
if
the
proposal
were
adopted
the
commission
would
be
abandoning
the
task
assigned
by
congress
to
evaluate
individual
self
certifications
on
their
own
individual
merits
such
an
interpretation
and
approach
would
immediately
be
vulnerable
to
challenge
under
the
supreme
court
recent
decision
in
loper
bright
enterprises

rejecting
the
concept
of
deference
to
agency
determinations
of
ambiguous
statutory
language
second
the
proposal
gives
insufficient
weight
to
the
value
and
significance
of
prediction
markets
to
the
public
interest
such
markets
have
been
employed
for
decades
and
have
proven
extremely
reliable
tools
for
forecasting
future
events
this
is
true
for
contested
events
like
elections
but
also
for
matters
like
the
spread
of
infectious
diseases
patterns
of
migration
and
weather
among
many
others
one
way
to
improve
the
accuracy
of
prediction
markets
is
to
allow
people
to
put
something
of
value
a
stake
behind
their
prediction
so
that
they
achieve
a
return
if
their
prediction
proves
correct
put
simply
people
put
more
effort
into
making
accurate
predictions
when
they
have
something
to
gain
by
doing
so
a
related
point
is
that
the
accuracy
of
prediction
markets
improves
as
more
people
participate
the
cftc
is
appropriately
concerned
with
situations
where
markets
are
susceptible
to
manipulation
it
is
also
true
and
the
cftc
has
stated
publicly
that
the
susceptibility
to
manipulation
goes
down
as
the
liquidity
of
markets
increases
thus
the
cftc
should
not
be
taking
action
that
will
discourage
participation
in
any
legitimate
market
third
prediction
markets
for
elections
are
already
a
global
reality
right
now
people
around
the
world
can
bet
on
election
outcomes
while
americans
themselves
are
left
out
of
the
process
these
markets
are
some
fringe
activity
they
are
being
taken
seriously
major
news
outlets
frequently
cite
prediction
market
odds
alongside
of
and
in
some
cases
instead
of
traditional
polls
it
becoming
clear
that
these
markets
are
an
important
part
of
how
we
discuss
and
understand
elections
citizens
should
be
able
to
participate
in
something
that
already
shaping
the
conversation
about
their
own
electoral
process
fourth
the
proposal
appears
to
us
to
be
a
solution
in
search
of
a
problem
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
89
fr
48968
notice
does
not
provide
any
reasonable
basis
for
concluding
that
prediction
markets
relating
to
elections
or
other
unknown
events
are
in
any
way
a
problem
or
that
anyone
has
been
harmed
by
the
existence
of
such
markets
there
is
no
evidence
cited
of
any
actual
harm
to
anyone
indeed
what
is
cited
a
mere
two
speculative
articles
noted
in
footnote
125
of
the
notice
falls
far
short
of
the
sort
of
analysis
the
cftc
should
be
conducting
indeed
the
proposal
does
not
satisfy
the
commission
obligation
to
fully
evaluate
and
account
for
the
costs
and
benefits
to
market
participants
of
prohibiting
particular
event
contracts
see
7
s
fifth
we
are
concerned
that
the
proposal
is
an
example
of
the
commission
picking
winners
and
losers
if
adopted
the
proposal
would
clearly
benefit
some
participants
in
relevant
markets
to
the
detriment
of
others
we
highlight
two
examples
below
1
the
proposal
plainly
benefits
existing
market
research
and
political
polling
firms
by
excluding
direct
competition
from
prediction
markets
the
cftc
offers
no
justification
for
this
choice
nor
explains
why
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
favor
a
certain
way
of
gathering
information
about
the
public
expectations
of
future
events
over
another
moreover
we
believe
that
traditional
polls
are
extremely
susceptible
to
manipulation
very
likely
more
so
than
prediction
markets
if
the
cftc
is
going
to
determine
for
example
that
a
poll
of
a
few
thousand
self
identified
potential
voters
who
answer
a
call
from
an
unknown
telephone
numbe
is
somehow
superior
and
more
in
the
public
interest
than
the
output
of
a
liquid
prediction
market
it
should
provide
evidence
to
justify
that
conclusion
2
the
proposal
favors
traditional
financial
markets
and
impedes
innovation
gemini
operates
in
the
crypto
space
as
opposed
to
the
tradfi
markets
in
recent
years
the
use
of
decentralized
prediction
markets
in
the
crypto
universe
has
grown
significantly
people
use
them
and
trust
them
because
of
the
wisdom
of
crowds
with
skin
in
the
game
we
firmly
believe
that
prediction
markets
are
so
effective
because
they
combine
two
of
humanity
most
potent
innovations
markets
asthe
information
aggregators
and
financial
incentives
as
behavior
motivators
cftc
should
be
encouraging
innovation
like
this
not
restricting
them
since
its
founding
in
2014
gemini
has
advocated
for
sound
responsible
and
thoughtful
regulation
we
stand
by
that
commitment
in
this
instance
however
we
believe
that
the
proposal
misses
that
mark
and
is
a
mistake
the
cftc
should
withdraw
the
proposal
we
would
be
happy
to
discuss
these
important
issues
further
with
the
commission
or
the
staff
at
any
time
