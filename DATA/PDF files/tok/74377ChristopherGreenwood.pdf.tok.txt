the
five
conflict
handling
modes
the
thomas
kilmann
conflict
mode
instrument
tki
assesses
an
individual
behavior
in
conflict
situations
that
is
situations
in
which
the
concerns
of
two
people
appear
to
be
incompatible
in
conflict
situations
we
can
describe
a
person
behavior
along
two
basic
dimensions
1
assertiveness
the
extent
to
which
the
individual
attempts
to
satisfy
his
or
her
own
concerns
and
2
cooperativeness
the
extent
to
which
the
individual
attempts
to
satisfy
the
other
person
concerns
these
two
dimensions
of
behavior
can
be
used
to
define
five
methods
of
dealing
with
conflict
these
five
conflict
handling
modes
are
shown
below
competing
competing
is
assertive
and
uncooperative
a
power
oriented
mode
when
competing
an
individual
pursues
his
or
her
own
concerns
at
the
other
person
expense
using
whatever
power
seems
appropriate
to
win
his
or
her
position
competing
might
mean
standing
up
for
your
rights
defending
a
position
you
believe
is
correct
or
simply
trying
to
win
collaborating
collaborating
is
both
assertive
and
cooperative
when
collaborating
an
individual
attempts
to
work
with
the
other
person
to
find
a
solution
that
fully
satisfies
the
concerns
of
both
it
involves
digging
into
an
issue
to
identify
the
underlying
concerns
of
the
two
individuals
and
to
find
an
alternative
that
meets
both
sets
of
concerns
collaborating
between
two
persons
might
take
the
form
of
exploring
a
disagreement
to
learn
from
each
other
insights
resolving
some
condition
that
would
otherwise
have
them
competing
for
resources
or
confronting
and
trying
to
find
a
creative
solution
to
an
interpersonal
problem
compromising
compromising
is
intermediate
in
both
assertiveness
and
cooperativeness
when
compromising
an
individual
has
the
objective
of
finding
an
expedient
mutually
acceptable
solution
that
partially
satisfies
both
parties
compromising
falls
on
a
middle
ground
between
competing
and
accommodating
giving
up
more
than
competing
but
less
than
accommodating
likewise
it
addresses
an
issue
more
directly
than
avoiding
but
does
explore
it
in
as
much
depth
as
collaborating
compromising
might
mean
splitting
the
difference
exchanging
concessions
or
seeking
a
quick
middle
ground
position
avoiding
avoiding
is
unassertive
and
uncooperative
when
avoiding
an
individual
does
not
immediately
pursue
his
or
her
own
concerns
or
those
of
the
other
person
he
or
she
does
not
address
the
conflict
avoiding
might
take
the
form
of
diplomatically
sidestepping
an
issue
postponing
an
issue
until
a
better
time
or
simply
withdrawing
from
a
threatening
situation
accommodating
accommodating
is
unassertive
and
cooperative
the
opposite
of
competing
when
accommodating
an
individual
neglects
his
or
her
own
concerns
to
satisfy
the
concerns
of
the
other
person
there
is
an
element
of
self
sacrifice
in
this
mode
accommodating
might
take
the
form
of
selfless
generosity
or
charity

all
five

in

each

recognizes
for
example
that
often
two

the
effectiveness

using
all

conflict
handling

you
can

a

style
of
dealing
with
conflict
however
most
people
use
some
modes
more
readily
than
others
develop
more
skills
in
those
modes

therefore
tend
to
rely

them
more
