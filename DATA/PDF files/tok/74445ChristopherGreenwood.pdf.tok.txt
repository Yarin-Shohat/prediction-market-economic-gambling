dear
commissioner
behnam
we
write
to
reiterate
the
concerns
expressed
by
our
colleagues
in
a
letter
dated
may
3
2024
whereby
the
letter
stated
the
following
we
are
concerned
by
reports
that
a
draft
proposed
rule
that
would
restrict
event
contracts
is
being
considered
by
the
cftc
to
prohibit
certain
products
limiting
event
contracts
could
stifle
responsible
and
regulated
innovation
and
encourage
industry
participants
to
move
their
trading
overseas
to
work
under
the
watch
of
foreign
regulators
who
would
not
provide
the
level
of
safety
standards
customer
protections
and
market
oversight
as
the
cftc
instead
the
cftc
should
embrace
the
authority
congress
has
already
given
it
to
encourage
regulated
and
safe
market
activity
on
event
contracts
so
the
united
states
can
continue
to
be
a
leader
in
financial
market
innovation
we
echo
the
concerns
about
the
process
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
is
undertaking
to
propose
this
new
rule
regarding
event
contracts
markets
and
in
light
of
the
open
meeting
on
may
10
2024
encourage
the
commission
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
public
by
engaging
in
a
hearing
or
public
roundtable
before
making
a
final
determination
