congress
contracts
for
public
comment
honorable
chairman
and
commissioners
of
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
from
2017
to
2021
i
had
the
privilege
to
serve
as
a
commissioner
of
the
cftc
under
the
leaderships
of
former
chairs
christopher
giancarlo
and
heath
tarbert
and
then
acting
chair
rostin
behnam
before
my
time
at
the
agency
i
ran
my
own
investment
firm
worked
for
a
bank
focused
hedge
fund
during
the
financial
crisis
and
served
as
a
staffer
in
the
house
of
representatives
since
leaving
public
office
i
have
been
an
advisor
for
andreessen
horowitz
capital
management
and
sit
on
kalshi
board
of
directors
i
remember
fondly
a
saying
at
the
agency
every
day
is
a
good
day
at
the
cftc
indeed
it
was
that
was
the
case
however
not
because
the
commission
avoided
making
hard
decisions
or
taking
the
easy
route
on
difficult
issues
in
fact
it
was
true
because
we
dealt
with
those
things
and
did
so
in
an
honest
transparent
and
accessible
manner
with
decisions
and
statements
well
supported
by
legal
analysis
data
and
commenters
perspectives
in
fact
during
my
time
as
a
commissioner
the
agency
deliberated
and
decided
upon
many
philosophically
challenging
controversial
and
statutorily
confusing
matters
in
the
execution
of
my
role
i
found
the
best
way
to
address
such
issues
was
adhering
to
a
strong
regulatory
philosophy
combined
with
a
very
deliberate
reading
of
the
statute
and
weighing
the
appropriateness
of
any
existing
or
proposed
regulations
to
the
issue
risks
and
opportunities
i
commend
the
current
chair
and
commissioners
for
taking
a
similar
posture
towards
their
duties
i
also
believe
as
has
been
expressed
through
our
constitution
and
through
the
precedent
of
multiple
supreme
court
decisions
that
the
government
has
limited
authority
and
independent
agencies
can
not
assume
broader
authorities
than
the
statutes
passed
by
congress
and
signed
into
law
by
the
president
convey
to
them
such
an
outcome
would
put
into
question
the
checks
and
balances
of
the
separation
of
powers
as
well
as
the
ability
of
the
population
to
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
government
decisions
speaking
of
power
independent
agencies
have
a
significant
amount
of
it
commissioners
serve
for
staggered
terms
agencies
regulations
are
heavily
insulated
from
congressional
review
and
the
chairs
are
difficult
to
remove
if
not
debatably
irremovable
from
office
as
such
a
deliberate
and
concerted
focus
on
what
discrete
authorities
the
law
conveys
and
whether
the
agency
is
acting
in
accordance
with
those
powers
in
a
manner
that
is
justified
consistent
and
repeatable
is
what
the
american
public
and
our
derivatives
markets
deserve
throughout
my
time
at
the
commission
and
consistently
through
its
distinguished
history
the
cftc
has
been
at
the
forefront
of
market
led
innovation
see
for
instance
christopher
giancarlo
letter
to
the
senate
committee
on
agriculture
nutrition
and
forestry

available

it
is
precisely
because
of
this
history
the
united
states
enjoys
the
deepest
most
liquid
and
broadest
derivatives
markets
in
the
world
along
those
lines
during
my
time
as
a
commissioner
the
agency
dealt
with
event
contracts
on
a
number
of
occasions
through
discussions
with
aristotle
on
the
scope
of
predictit
activity
through
considering
and

to
operate
a

to

repeated
efforts
to
move
innovative
event

as
another

commend
you
for
undertaking

for

and
thoughtfulness
in

after

it

that

came
after
significant
engagement
over

last
year
with
the

oversight

introduction
kalshi
proposed
contracts
comport
with
the
law
would
provide
meaningful
economic
and
social
benefits
and
should
be
approved
further
because
it
is
critical
for
the

to
make
determinations
based
on
the
law
and
not
speculation
fear
or
comfort
the
commission
can
not
and
should
not
disapprove
these
contracts
such
reasoning
is
important
not
only
for
the
members
of
the
marketplace
and
registrants
but
for
the
commission
reputation
and
standing
itself
this
decision
will
have
significant
implications
for
the
future
of
the
marketplace
kalshi

presents
the
commission
with
an
opportunity
to
right
the
wrongs
of
nadex
and
make
a
decision
compliant
with
the
law
and
consistent
with
broad
segments
of

the

not

the

determined

public
interest
5
the
special
rule
includes
three
important
steps
for
a
contract
to
be
relevant
first
the
contract
in
question
must
be
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
in
other
words
an
event
contract
second
the
contract
event
must
involve
at
least
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
then
if
the
commission
finds
that
the
contract
does
involve
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
it
may
determine
the
contract
as
a
whole
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
nadex
concluded
that
participating
in
the
political
event
contracts
in
question
was
equivalent
to
wagering
or
betting
and
thus
gaming
to
trigger
the
special
rule
beyond
its
blatantly
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
this
is
a
shockingly
poor
and
vague
classification
of
activity
that
would
scope
in
common
and
vital
participation
in
the
futures
market
how
should
the
line
between
morally
dubious
gaming
activity
and
important
and
valuable
speculative
activity
be
drawn
gaming
describes
wagering
money
on
an
occurrence
that
has
no
inherent
economic
value
itself
other
than
the
money
wagered
on
its
outcome
for
instance
wagering
money
on
roulette
or
blackjack
should
be
considered
gaming
because
there
is
no
economic
significance
of
the
activity
apart
from
the
wager
itself
speculation
on
the
contrary
is
risking
value
where
the
underlying
activity
has
economic
consequences
which
then
means
the
speculative
activity
creates
valuable
societal
and
economic
benefit
from
a
price
discovery
and
risk
transfer
function
for
those
exposed
to
the
risk
of
that
underlying
activity
unbelievably
the
commission
never
concretely
defined
or
even
philosophically
stated
the
difference
between
gaming
as
represented
in
and
the
speculation
that
exists
every
day
in
derivatives
marketplaces
and
is
a
critical
component
of
their
purpose
but
yet
it
has
chosen
to
and
may
choose
to
again
here
apply
a
term
it
has
defined
to
an
activity
that
is
actually
more
similar
to
traditional
and
valuable
speculative
market
participation
multiple
esteemed
and
long
time
futures

and
former
cftc

are
also
included
in
kalshi
submission
the
commission
would
owe
them
a
strong
explanation
if
its
conclusion
on
this
point
has
not
changed
there
are
plenty
of
events
that
have
a
discernable
and
legitimate
economic
impact
and
whose
probabilistic
outcomes
can
be
estimated
through
an
analysis
of
relevant
factors
they
are
not
gambling
activities
nor
are
they
games
of
chance
that
is
just
as
true
for
election
outcomes
as
it
is
for
the
prices
production
and
demand
of
things
like
oil
corn
or
gold
hedge
funds
put
infrared
cameras
on
natural
gas
processing
facilities
to
know
the
minutes
they
are
operating
or
shut
down
so
they
have
an
edge
on
estimating
production
figures
some
investment
firms
have
micro
climate
weather
experts
so
as
to
more
accurately
predict
localized
rainfall
and
drought
conditions
to
get
a
better
estimate
on
crop
yields
those
same
firms
market
positions
then
also
provide
a
strong
economic
benefit
if
the
firms
are
confident
enough
in
their
predictions
they
will
move
the
equilibrium
price
and
provide
a
market
signal
to
any
business
involved
from
production
to
processing
to
distribution
of
the
economic
value
that
can
be
hedged
based
on
an
event
perceived
outcome
estimating
election
outcomes
and
expressing
that
view
through
a
market
mechanism
is
just
as
valuable
to
society
as
estimating
oil
corn
or
gold
fundamentals
and
expressing
those
views
through
existing
futures
contracts
as
a
case
in
point
the
demand
for
such
predictive
election
information
has
exploded
in
recent
years
and
has
been
the
basis
of
entire
publications
like
fivethirtyeight
or
the
new
york
times
needle
from
a
statutory
perspective
the
relevant
portion
of
the
cea
prohibits
registered
boards
of
trade
from
listing
event
contracts
whose
underlying
activities
reference
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
cea
did
not
give
the
commission
authority
to
conclude
that
participating
in
the
contract
could
constitute
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
statute
is
very
clear
on
this
matter
i
the
statute
limits
the
scope
of
the
commission
authority
to
activities
and
activities
only
the
commission
only
has
discretion
to
take
action
on
event
contracts
whose
event
involves
1
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
2
one
of
four
specifically
listed
activities
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
or
3
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
to
becontrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
itself
has
previously
acknowledged
that
the
special
rule
textual
focus
is
on
activities
the
underlying
conduct
in
describing
it
the
commission
stated
that
the
rule
applied
to
contracts
that
involve
one
or
more
activities
enumerated
in
the
dodd
frank
act
provisions
common
to
registered
entities
proposed
rule
75
fed
reg
2
2010
section
745
of
the
dodd
frank
act
also
authorizes
the
commission
to
prohibit
the
listing
of
event
contracts
based
on
certain
excluded
commodities
if
such
contracts
involve
one
or
more
activities
enumerated
in
the
dodd
frank
act
proposed
rule
see
17
at
if
the
commission
determines
that
such
product
may
involve
an
activity
that
is
enumerated
in
these
activities
are
not
the
contracts
themselves
they
are
the
events
that
create
the
basis
for
the
relevant
contract
ii
if
congress
assumed
as
the
commission
implies
through
nadex
that
the
act
of
participating
in
a
event
contract
could
itself
constitute
gaming
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contracts
upon
which
the
commission
could
make
a
public
interest
determination
since
they
would
already
fall
under
the
unlawful
activity
prong
iii
if
state
gambling
definitions
of
wager
and
bet
are
analogous
to
the
act
of
taking
a
position
in
the
political
event
contracts
as
nadex
argues
nadex
at
2
3
then
those
same
state
definitions
would
be
analogous
to
taking
a
position
on
any
event
contract
including
ones
whose
underlying
activity
is
an
economic
indicator
or
the
weather
the
commission
can
not
hold
that
participating
in
these
proposed
contracts
involve
gaming
without
also
implicating
participation
in
all
other
event
contracts
such
an
outcome
would
also
clearly
be
in
tension
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
which
is
to
carve
out
a
select
few
event
contracts
with
an
underlying
activity
that
is
specifically
referenced
or
subsequently
identified
by
the
commission
through
a
rulemaking
iv
this
interpretation
would
require
the
commission
to
interpret
involve
differently
across
the
enumerated
activities
since
participating
in
any
event
contract
itself
clearly
can
not
ever
constitute
an
act
of
assassination
war
or
terrorism
is
on
excluded
commodity
subject
to
the
commission
jurisdiction
and
being
vetted
through
the
v
the
statute
actually
prevents
events
with
no
financial
impacts
to
be
considered
as
excluded
commodities
in
order
for
the
special
rule
in
to
apply
to
kalshi
contracts
those
contracts
already
have
to
be
on
events
that
are
considered
excluded
commodities
the
statutory
definition
of
an
excluded
commodity
includes
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
that
is
1
beyond
the
control
of
the
relevant
parties
to
the
contract
and
2
associated
with
a
financial
commercial
or
economic
consequence
7
because
kalshi
contract
special
rule
then
by
the
very
definition
of
an
excluded
commodity
in
the
statute
the
event
contains
an
economic
risk
that
can
be
hedged
if
the
event
did
not
then
that
event
would
constitute
gaming
not
an
excluded
commodity
and
not
subject
to
the
commission
purview
questions
other
venues
offerings
in
the
second
question
posed
to
the
public
for
comment
the
commission
asked
whether
it
should
consider
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
whether
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
when
making
its
gaming
determination
it
is
difficult
to
understand
the
rationale
for
including
this
question
but
that
sentiment
is
not
unique
to
this
question
either
as
this
is
one
of
several
examples
of
arbitrary
standards
proposed
through
the
commission
questions
to
the
public
strikingly
this
specific
question
was
not
asked
of
the
public
when
it
was
considering
the
legality
of
erisx
proposed
nfl
futures
contracts
which
are
a
staple
of
such
venues
questions
on
the
eris
exchange
llc
erisx
rsbix
nfl
futures
contracts
for
public
comment
available
at
additionally
this
standard
is
not
found
in
law
or
in
commission
history
and
precedent
moreover
partisan
control
of
congress
is
not
a
bet
available
on
any
legal
american
sportsbook
that
it
is
sometimes
available
on
illegal
ones
can
not
be
held
against
kalshi
proposal
taking
a
possible
motive
of
this
question
to
its
potentially
backward
conclusion
it
would
be
challenged
regulatory
logic
to
allow
bucket
shops
illegal
venues
casinos
or
offshore
markets
to
preclude
a
cftc
registered
exchange
from
offering
a
contract
by
virtue
of
listing
that
contract
themselves
similarly
we
are
fortunate
the
agency
has
never
proposed
this
standard
in
the
past
as
it
would
have
likely
precluded
the
exchange
listing
of
many
new
derivatives
products
the
most
recent
example
of
such
is
the
agency
greenlight
for
cboe
and
cme
bitcoin

contracts
which
traded
in
some
form
or
fashion
in
many
unregulated
venues
before

registered

question
state
laws
the
commission
has
asked
whether
kalshi
proposal
involves
state
law
provisions
that
prohibit
wagering
on
the
outcomes
of
elections
in
addition
to
the
federal
prohibition
on
interstate
gambling
questions
three
and
four
as
discussed
at
length
above
the
statute
refers
to
the
underlying
activity
of
the
contract
not
the
contract
itself
the
contract
only
involves
obviously
legal
activity
the
partisan
affiliation
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
president
pro
tempore
however
even
if
the
commission
did
consider
the
contract
as
a
whole
instead
of
just
the
contract
underlying
event
against
state
laws
the
contract
nonetheless
does
not
involve
illegal
activity
because
of
preemption
a
contract
offered
by
a
registered
board
of
trade
otherwise
compliant
with
the
law
and
regulations
could
never
constitute
unlawful
state
activity
there
is
no
scenario
where
a
kalshi
member
would
be
illegally
trading
the
proposed
contract
on
the
exchange
from
a
state
law
perspective
in
addition
the
definition
of
gaming
cited
by
nadex
in
federal
law
had
a
carveout
specifically
for
regulated
derivative
products
like
kalshi
proposal
as
do
many
state
laws
regarding
gaming
similarly
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
explicitly
overrules
state
gaming
and
bucket
shop
provisions
state
laws
should
not
be
relevant
whatsoever
in
this
instance
and
should
not
be
considered
in
this
process

which
added

to

this

left

the

political
contracts
based
on
what
is
presumed
to
be
a
short
dialogue
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
the
congressional
record
turning
to
the
legislative
history
or
specifically
a
dialogue
between
only
two
of
the
535
members
of
the
house
and
senate
on
this
matter
is
a
reach
the
law
which
both
chambers
passed
and
the
president
signed
is
clear
and
congress
specifically
removed
the
economic
purpose
test
from
the
law
rather
than
re
enact
the
economic
purpose
test
congress
specifically
chose
instead
to
create
the
special
rule
to
target
contracts
whose
events
dealt
with
events
that
could
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
not
and
can
not
the
absence
of
this
provision
to
mean
congress
would
still
prefer
the
commission
had
that
narrow
tool
while
the
economic
purpose
test
might
be
a
good
test
it
is
not
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
require
here
and
at
this

without
a
change

9
the
commission
asks
if
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
are
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
based
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
it
further
asks
for
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
directly
hedged
via
the
proposed
contracts
again
the
commission
is
implementing
too
narrow
of
a
standard
for
hedging
utility
of
event
contracts
or
of
futures
contracts
writ
large
changes
in
general
risk
can
provide
a
strong
hedging
need
as
opposed
to
the
changes
in
risk
of
a
specific
outcome
if
one
party
were
to
take
over
complete
control
of
congress
there
is
likely
to
be
a
change
in
general
risk
on
carbon
based
energy
products
and
industries
and
an
opposite
change
in
general
risk
on
renewable
energy
products
and
industries
while
the
specific
policies
implemented
may
be
hard
to
know
in
advance
that
change
in
general
risk
has
been
discussed
at
length
in
comment

is
hedged
extensively
by

for
example
following
the
election
of
republicans
into
congress
in
2016
many
publications
speculated
that
trade
policy
would
become
more
restrictive
but
it
was
not
known
if
this
would
come
in
the
form
of
new
but
restrictive
trade
deals
re
negotiating
existing
trade
agreements
new
tarrifs
and
if
so
on
what
goods
and
at
what
level
international
lawsuits
and
more
the
general
risk
however
of
future
restrictive
trade
policy
to
those
industries
firms
and
individuals
heavily
exposed
to
foreign
trade
existed
concretely
and
directly
because
of
who
would
win
the
election
this
risk
is
exactly
what
kalshi
contracts
allow
traders
to
hedge
in
question
eleven
the
commission
makes
the
same
mistake
when
it
asks
if
the
contract
could
form
the
basis
of
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
not
only
is
this
language
from
the
discarded
economic
purpose
test
this
question
also
excludes
a
price
forming
impact
on
other
futures
contracts
such
as
other
event
contracts
themselves
if
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
list
an
event
contract
on
potential
tax
rates
two
years
from
now
that
contract
price
would
have
an
embedded
probability
of
which
parties
control
congress
at
that
time
eliciting
that
probability
through
a
market
based
event
contract
directly
on
the
political
control
of
each
chamber
would
serve
a
valuable
price
discovery
function
for
a
tax
rate
contract
as
well
as
other
policy
related
contracts
it
is
unfortunate
the
commission
discarded
this
valuable
price
basing
use
case
from
the
question
list
the
economic
purpose
test
represented
through
this
question
is
too
narrow
for
other
reasons
in
the
nadex
decision
the
commission
acknowledged
this
by
suggesting
it
could
consider
other
factors
in
its
decision
regarding
public
interest
these
other
factors
which
should
be
considered
here
as
well
are
actually
reasons
to
support
the
contract
not
oppose
it
a
market
based
probability
of
election
outcomes
would
provide
an
extremely
valuable
public
service
and
act
as
a
competitor
to
polls
and
paid
pundits
this
is
sorely
needed
in
american
politics
and
it
is
exactly
why
one

the

hedging

available
at
none
of
the
statutory
language
nor
the
commission
regulations
address
many
of
the
questions
the
commission
poses
here
in
evaluating
these
contracts
a
government
agency
can
also
not
deny
a
proposal
by
relying
on
authorities
or
frameworks
it
wishes
it
had
or
any
internal
or
external
promises
to
redo
any
existing
regulations
to
create
a
different
and
clearer
framework
in
the
future
the
commission
has
the
statute
at
hand
and
the
regulations
it
has
passed
to
deal
with
the
proposals
currently
before
it
a
credible
regulator
also
can
not
continue
to
rely
on
varying
and
disprovable
conjectures
to
impose
value
judgments
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
from
potential
cherry
picked
state
laws
which
are
inconsistent
broad
and
would
be
preempted
by
any
commission
action
to
an
improvised
imprecise

non

procedure
act
based
definition
of

which
if
applied
widely
would
cut
out
large
swaths
of

activity
to
imposing
a
narrow
and
changing
economic
purpose
standard
found
nowhere
in
the
statute
nor
ever
clearly
defined
by
commission
regulations
which
would
give
the
commission
unlimited
authority
over
major
questions
and
put
the
onus
on
exchanges
instead
of
the
agency
no
such
excuses
have
any
legal
merit
while
it
may
seem
difficult
to
overturn
prior
precedent
i
believe
the
analysis
is
actually
very
straight
forward
given
the
enormous
extant
evidence
provided
well
in
excess
of
legal
requirement
the
commission
needs
to
fully
engage
with
kalshi
proposed
contracts
and
approve
them
if
it
does
not
believe
that
the
market
would
find
these
to
be
useful
hedging
and
price
basing
tools
despite
market
participants
esteemed
academics
and
former
government
officials
repeated
testimony
it
should
provide
its
reasoning
in
detail
pursuant
to
its
existing
authorities
and
regulations
rather
than
dismiss
the
contract
out
of
hand
businesses
especially
ones
that
have
long
term
engagement
with
regulators
deserve
to
have
a
consistent
and
repeatable
framework
by
which
they
can
operate
their
firms
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
regulations

of
these

for

of
the
