dear

respectfully
requests
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
the
commission
proposed
amendments
to
regulation
which
aim
to
further
specify
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
respectfully
we
offer
the
following
comments
on
the
proposed
rule
we
commend
the
cftc
efforts
to
provide
clarity
regarding
event
contracts
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
however
we
urge
the
commission
to
reconsider
the
extent
of
its
interpretive
authority
in
light
of
the
recent
supreme
court
decision
in
loper

which

on

agencies
the
supreme
court
ruling
in
loper
bright
fundamentally
alters
the
legal
landscape
in
which
the
cftc
operates
the
court
held
that
matters
of
statutory
interpretation
are
to
be
resolved
de
novo
by
the
judiciary
thereby
eliminating
the
presumption
of
deference
that
agencies
like
the
cftc
previously
enjoyed
under
chevron

courts
must
now
use
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction
to
determine
the
best
reading
of
a
statute
and
ensure
the
agency
action
aligns
with
it
while
an
agency
opinion
can
still
be
considered
if
found
to
be
persuasive
any
ambiguities
in
statutes
must
now
be
addressed
by
congress
rather
than
agency
interpretations
this
shift
necessitates
that
an
agency
interpretations
align
closely
with
the
statutory
text
and
legislative
intent
of
the
relevant
statute
this
is
what
is
required
of
the
cftc
in
relation
to
the
cea
vis
à
vis
the
proposed
rule
the
proposed
rule
exceeds
the
agency
statutory
authority
and
requires
judicial
review
in
this
context
the
proposed
rule
categorical
rejection
of
event
contracts
betting
on
election
results
as
contrary
to
the
public
interest
equating
them
with
illicit
contracts
on
war
terrorism
and
assassination
demands
a
thorough
review
by
the
courts
specifically
our
concerns
are
the
following
1
definition
of
gaming
the
proposed
rule
seeks
to
define
gaming
under
cea
section
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
event
contracts

the
commission
has
made
clear
this
definition
would
include
political
contests
and
in
its
view
an
election
related
event
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
disagree
with
that
perspective
political
event
contracts
should
not
be
equated
with
gambling
on
games
of
chance
like
the
super
bowl
rather
elections
have
significant
economic
implications
these
contracts
were
designed
to
serve
crucial
risk
hedging
functions
aligning
with
the
requirements
of
the
cea
and
offer
valuable
predictive
data
to
the
public
for
these
reasons
they
should
not
be
considered
contrary
to
the
public
interest
furthermore
the
proposed
rule
exceeds
the
cftc
purview
by
partially
regulating
election
related
issues
in
violation
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
apa
5
c
2
public
interest
determination
the
cftc
categorical
determination
that
election
event
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
must
be
re
evaluated
in
light
of
the
supreme
court
ruling
in
loper
the
statutory
language
of
the
cea
does
not
explicitly
preclude
all
such
contracts
and
thus
each
category
should
be
examined
with
a
nuanced
understanding
of
its
potential
benefits
and
risks
instead
of
responsibly
regulating
these
new
markets
the
commission
plans
to
ban
a
broad
range
of
them
a
blanket
ban
on
certain
event
contracts
misinterprets
the
cea
which
requires
a
two
step
process
first
determining
if
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
and
second
assessing
whether
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
proposed
rule
bypasses
this
two
step
process
financial
regulation
should
rely
on
data
and
law
not
uninformed
preconceptions
7
such
sweeping
prohibitions
create
uncertainty
and
drive
individuals
needing
risk
management
tools
to
offshore
unregulated
venues
exposing
consumers
to
harm
moreover
the
united
states
risks
falling
behind
other
countries
the
proposed
rule
bans
most
event
contracts
without
i
reviewing
their
specific
terms
ii
understanding
their
hedging
utility
or
iii
evaluating
the
merits
of
prediction
markets
as
innovative
platforms
that
promote
democratic
values
3
judicial
interpretation
given
that
the
courts
are
now
the
final
arbiters
of
statutory
interpretation
with
the
overturning
of
the
chevron
doctrine
the
cftc
must
ensure
that
its
regulations
are
defensible
under
judicial
scrutiny
this
includes
providing
clear
evidencebased
justifications
for
why
certain
event
contracts
should
be
prohibited
and
demonstrating
how
such
prohibitions
align
with
the
cea
intent
and
objectives
the
cftc
is
neither
a
gambling
nor
an
election
regulator
and
is
not
equipped
to
regulate
this
market
whether
the
cftc
has
jurisdiction
over
election
events
contracts
requires
a
court
determination
as
such
we
recommend
that
the
commission
wait
for
the
conclusion
of
the
lawsuit
with
kalshi
kalshiex
llc
commodity
futures
trading
commission
so
that
a
judge
can
properly
rule
on
statutory
interpretation
thank
you
for
your
attention
in
considering
our
perspectives
on
the
proposed
rule
we
welcome
discussing
our
comments
with
the
cftc
and
its
staff
yours
sincerely
