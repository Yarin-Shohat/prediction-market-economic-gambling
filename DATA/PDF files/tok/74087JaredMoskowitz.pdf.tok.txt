dear
commissioner
behnam
we
write
to
express
concerns
regarding
the
process
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
is
undertaking
to
propose
a
new
rule
regarding
event
contract
markets
and
encourage
any
action
by
the
commission
be
undertaken
in
a
deliberate
and
transparent
manner
we
are
concerned
by
reports
that
a
draft
proposed
rule
that
would
restrict
event
contracts
is
being
considered
by
the
cftc
to
prohibit
certain
products
limiting
event
contracts
could
stifle
responsible
and
regulated
innovation
and
encourage
industry
participants
to
move
their
trading
overseas
to
work
under
the
watch
of
foreign
regulators
who
would
not
provide
the
level
of
safety
standards
customer
protections
and
market
oversight
as
the
cftc
instead
the
cftc
should
embrace
the
authority
congress
has
already
given
it
to
encourage
regulated
and
safe
market
activity
on
event
contracts
so
the
united
states
can
continue
to
be
a
leader
in
financial
market
innovation
during
a
house
agriculture
committee
hearing
on
march
6
2024
you
stated
it
was
your
goal
to
clarify
the
rules
derived
from
the
commodity
exchange
act
to
ensure
no
new
participant
or
company
lists
political
event
contracts
while
you
have
made
your
position
clear
we
want
to
ensure
that
any
rulemaking
undertaken
by
the
commission
properly
examines
all
facts
and
details
and
thoroughly
considers
the
potential
benefits
this
economic
activity
might
have
on
nontraditional
market
participants
rather
than
arrive
at
a
presupposed
position
you
further
stated
that
political
event
contracts
were
prohibited
due
to
them
being
classified
as
gaming
as
well
as
unlawful
under
state
law
and
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
the
commission
considers
future
action
we
would
encourage
the
commission
to
consider
if
its
reasoning
here
would
also
mean
that
other
contracts
currently
being
offered
such
as
contracts
on
market
volatility
digital
assets
oil
and
even
the
weather
are
equally
gaming
and
not
legitimate
economic
activity
in
previous
actions
taken
by
the
cftc
the
commission
stated
it
found
political
event
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
a
form
of
the
economic
purpose
test
that
was
removed
through
congressional
action
in
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
given
congress
has
determined
this
test
no
longer
serves
as
a
viable
evaluation
we
urge
the
commission
to
clarify
how
it
best
determines
these
contracts
run
contrary
to
the
public
interest
lastly
we
recognize
the
commission
is
involved
in
ongoing
litigation
related
to
event
contracts
we
urge
caution
that
this
rulemaking
or
any
future
rulemaking
does
not
influence
ongoing
legal
proceedings
given
that
this
action
has
the
potential
to
affect
a
large
set
of
products
we
believe
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
the
public
for
the
commission
to
engage
in
a
hearing
or
public
roundtable
before
making
a
final
determination
we
appreciate
the
commission
commitment
to
a
rules
based
process
and
encourage
you
and
your
fellow
commissioners
to
take
a
thoughtful
and
deliberate
approach
when
considering
event
contracts
it
is
vital
that
stakeholders
remain
involved
in
these
conversations
and
the
commission
provides
clear
reasoning
for
any
proposal
put
forward
sincerely
