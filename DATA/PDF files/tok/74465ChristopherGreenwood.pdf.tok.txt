re

proposed
congressional
control
contracts
commissioners
we
sincerely
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
submission
by
kalshiex
llc
of
its
proposed
congressional
control
contracts
for
commission
review
and
approval
the
question
of
election
event
contracts
raises
important
issues
of
both
law
and
public
policy
and
we
commend
the
commission
for
recognizing
their
importance
and
seeking
public
input
we
submit
this
comment
on
behalf
of
an
anonymous
client
with
a
deep
interest
in
the
lawfulness
of
election
event
contracts
we
believe
the
commission
has
a
sound
basis
in
law
and
policy
for
approving
kalshi
proposed
contracts
as
to
the
law
we
believe
that
election
event
contracts
like
kalshi
do
not
involve
gaming
under
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
or
rule
of
the
commission
regulations
and
so
are
not
proscribed
by
those
provisions
in
addition
we
believe
that
rule
properly
understood
in
light
of
the
cea
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
apa
affords
the
commission
discretion
to
approve
election
event
contracts
even
if
those
contracts
do
involve
gaming
finally
as
to
policy
we
believe
election
event
contracts
promote
the
public
good
by
among
other
things
enhancing
the
accuracy
of
political
predictions
promoting
new
forms
of
democratic
participation
and
serving
as
an
economic
hedge
for
both
firms
and
individuals
we
thus
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
proposed
contracts
section
and
rule
do
not
apply
to
election
event
contracts
under
the
cea
the
commission
must
approve
contracts
submitted
to
it
unless
the
commission
affirmatively
finds
that
they
violate
the
cea
or
the
commission
regulations

the
commission
has
expressed
concern
that
election
event
contracts
may
conflict
with
section
of
the
act
and
rule
which
together
prohibit
event
contracts
based
on
gaming
four
other
enumerated
activities
or
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
but
an
election
is
not
gaming
nor
any
of
the
other
four
prohibited
activities
nor
a
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
thus
kalshi
contracts
are
lawful
and
should
be
approved
the
commission
previously
found
an
election
event
contract
to
be
gaming

was

the

section

where
the
event
on
which
the
event

is
based
is
an

of

they
do
not
prohibit
event
contracts
simply
because
entering
into
the
contract
might
itself
be
construed
as
a
form
of
gaming
indeed
as
explained
below
all
event
contracts
involve
making
predictions
and
related
wagers
about
future
occurrences
that
are
outside

the

were
this
facial

with

a
plainly
untenable
result
moreover
even
if
considered
under

an

event

not

gaming
has
a
well
established

precise
meaning
betting
on

an
election

not
a

these
provisions
are
best
read
to
exclude
election
event
contracts
elections
are
not
games
and
so
can
not
be
seen
as
gaming
nor
can
the
election
event
contract
itself
supply
the
requisite
gaming
as
that
would
upend
the
statutory
scheme
by
converting
every
event
contract
into
gaming
after
all
every
event
contract
is
based
on
an
uncertain
future
occurrence
such
an
interpretation
of
gaming
would
thus
in
turn
read
out
of
the
statute
the
other
terms
in

because
each
would
be
gaming
under
that
view
such
an
interpretation
is
not

the
statutory
and
regulatory
text
shows
that
election
contracts
are
based
on
elections
rather
than
gaming
or
other
prohibited

an
election
for
public

is
not
any
of
the

enumerated
in

it
is
obviously
not
an

the

gaming
within
the

because
such
a

is
based

a

is
a

on

harvest
sector
of

or
election

does
not

because
that

of

is
not
based
on
a

contrary
to

reasoning
it
is

indeed
it

not

rationale
in

for

that
