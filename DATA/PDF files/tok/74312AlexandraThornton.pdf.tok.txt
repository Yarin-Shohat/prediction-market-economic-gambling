is
an

institute
that
is
dedicated
to
improving
the
lives
of
all
americans
through
bold
progressive
ideas
strong
leadership
and
concerted
action
we
strongly
support
the
commission
codification
of
its
position
that
contracts
based
directly
or
indirectly
on
election
outcomes
constitute
gaming
as
well
as
the
proposal
clarifications
and
non
exclusive
examples
of
enumerated
activities
and
its
helpful
discussion
of
how
it
will
assess
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
while
these
changes
are
welcome
we
are
concerned
that
the
proposal
may
inadvertently
help
to
promote
event
contracts
that
are
not
clearly
prohibited
but
are
nevertheless
likely
not
compliant
with
the
requirements
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
and
the
core
principles
indeed
the
proposal
highlights
the
need
for
the
commission
to
more
directly
exercise
its
responsibility
to
review
analyze
and
ensure
that
all
dcm
listings
and
rules
comply
with
the
law
and
core
principles
the
commission
appropriately
codifies
the
position
that
contracts
based
on
political
elections
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
are
prohibited
we
strongly
support
the
proposal
explicit
language
identifying
political
election
contests
as
a
gaming
activity
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
a
prohibited
basis
for
a
contract
the
commission
helpfully
codifies
its
position
that
contracts
based
either
directly
or
indirectly
on
election
outcomes
constitute
gaming
and
that
contracts
based
on
gaming
as
a
category
are
against
the
public
interest
and
thus
explicitly
prohibited
the
recognition
that
contracts
based
on
the
outcomes
of
political
elections
raise
unique
concerns
including
about
the
commission
appropriate
role
in
this
area
and
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
correct
for
all
the
reasons
identified
in
the
proposal
most
important
this
aspect
of
the
proposal
is
consistent
with
election
law
and
protects
the
public
interest
and
integrity
of
the
voting
process
as
the
commission
states
in
the

related
its
concerns
about

from

to
the

july

available

at
that
time
we
warned
that
allowing
contracts
based
on
election
outcomes
could
lead
to
election
interference
voter
manipulation
and
disinformation
campaigns
which
would
ultimately
erode
public
trust
in
the
democratic
process
these
contracts
cap
argued
pose
significant
risks
to
the
integrity
of
elections
by
introducing
financial
incentives
that
could
distort
voter
behavior
and
undermine
the
fundamental
principles
of
fair
and
free
elections
cap
recommended
that
the
commission
hold
to
its
longstanding
view
that
such
contracts
constitute
gaming
and
are
inherently
against
the
public
interest
and
we
were
pleased
that
it
did
so

while
the
commission
made
the
right
decision
in
the
case
it
was
then
challenged
in
court
this
episode
clearly
demonstrates
that
dcms
which
have
an
interest
in
listing
and
promoting
as
many
products
as
possible
will
continue
to
offer
strained
interpretations
of
the
law
and
core
principles
to
list
products
and
challenge
any
resistance
from
the
commission
in
court
the
agency
must
promulgate
a
strong
substantive
rule
and
clear
process
to
ensure
that
the
agency
is
able
not
just
to
come
to
the
right
conclusion
but
also
to
defend
its
decisions
in
court
we
also
commend
the
commission
for
clarifying
that
contracts
based
on
activities
and
outcomes
that
are
similar
to
or
a
proxy
for
political
contests
are
equally
prohibited
the
extensive
examples
of
this
in
our
digital
data
driven
economy
fully
warrant
this
approach
this
further
explanation
sends
a
clear
message
that
workarounds
are
also
prohibited
as
they
can
lead
to
harms
similar
to
those
that
could
occur
as
a
result
of
a
contract
that
is
directly
based
on
the
outcome
of
one
or
more
political
elections
the
proposal
expansive
view
of
public
interest
is
consistent
with
congressional
intent
we
agree
with
the
commission
interpretation
of
the
statutory
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
event
contract
prohibition
as
requiring
the
commission
to
take
a
broad
view
when
assessing
potential
public
interest
harms
the
commission
correctly
recognizes
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
even
where
such
contract
or
category
of
contracts
may
have
certain
hedging
or
price
basing
utility
proposal
at
48979
the
commission
appropriately
adopts
the
view
that
national
security
and
more
broadly
the
public
good
are
relevant
factors
for
consideration
in
an
evaluation
of
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
purposes
of
cea
section
proposal
at
48980
it
helpfully
provides
a
non
exclusive
list
of
other
factors
that
may
be
relevant
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
including
the
extent
to
which
the
contract
would
draw
the
commission
into
areas
outside
of
its
primary
regulatory
remit

the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
or
result
in
market
participants
profiting
from
harm
to
any
person
or
group
of
persons
proposal
at
48980
the
process
the
commission
relies
on
allows
for
easy
evasion
the
commission
is
statutorily
obligated
to
ensure
that
dcm
rules
comply
with
the
cea
and
core
principles
however
the
commission
has
adopted
internal
procedural
rules
that
are
excessively
deferential
to
self
interested
dcms
and
expose
the
commission
and
markets
to
significant
risks
while
also
constraining
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
intervene
nevertheless
the
proposal
would
expand
the
commission
reliance
upon
those
procedural
rules
in
fact
despite
the
commission
longstanding
failure
to
effectively
and
transparently
police

the

notes
that
they

that
are
not
readily
susceptible

but
what
if
a
dcm
or
sef
decides
to
list
and
trade
a
product
that
should
not
be
permitted
the
proposal
itself
exists
because
dcms
took
a
very
expansive
view
of
what
is
permitted
under
the
law
and
core
principles
and
the
commission
clearly
disagrees
with
that
view
and
while
kalshiex
involved
a
hot
button
issue
that
public
interest
groups
had
been
following
countless
other
listings
and
rule
changes
may
fly
under
the
radar
with
no
other
public
discourse
or
awareness
or
agency
action
the
need
for
the
proposal
is
a
direct
result
of
a
flawed
commission
process
for
ensuring
dcms
compliance
with
the
law
and
core
principles
today
commission

permit
dcms
to

inquiry

and
then

commission
rule
which
applies
more
broadly
to
rule

establishes
three
different
categories
of
rule
changes
and
sets
forth
different
requirements
for
each
first
there
are
dcm
rules
that
demand
full
self

and
formal

and

processes

next
there
are
dcm
rules
for
which
the
commission
only
requires
a
notice
but
there
are
no
formal
comment
periods
or
other
automatic
procedural
safeguards
finally
there
are
dcm
rules
for
which
the
commission
does
not
even
require
dcms
to
provide
timely
notice
to
the
commission
17
only
in
rare
circumstances
does
the
commission
ensure
that
the
public
is
afforded
the
opportunity
to
provide
comment
on
rule
filings
or
afford
itself
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
intervene
for
dcm
rules
that
are
self
certified
the
commission
has
a
nearly
impossible
to
meet
timeline
and
substantive
burden
to
intervene
ten
days
for
the
agency
to
effectively
drop
everything
else
undertake
a
deep
analysis
and
then
move
to
stay
the
rule
or
disapprove
of
it
is
simply
not
enough
time
if
the
commission
is
able
to
initiate
a
stay
then
it
may
undertake
a
notice
and
comment
process
but
that
process
also
is
subject
to
compressed
timelines
this
entire
process
stands
in
sharp
contrast
to
rule
changes
by
registered
securities
exchanges
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
rules
mandate
that
all
registered
securities
exchange
rule
changes
be
formally
filed
with
the
agency
all
exchange
filings
are
put
out
for
public
comment
and
the
sec
has
much
more
time
to
intervene
the
cftc
decision
to
simply
adopt
internal
rules
to
relieve
itself
of
its
burden
to
effectively
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
and
the
core
principles
is
inconsistent
with
its
mission
the
law
and
its
regulatory
peer
not
surprisingly
the
commission
has
thus
allowed
increasingly
complex
products
to
come
to
market
including
crypto
futures
products
without
any
meaningful
interventions
new
product
filings
and
rule
changes
are
rarely
challenged
by
the
agency
and
when
they
are
the
agency
is
likely
to
be
challenged
in
court
in
part
because
it
has
voluntarily
created
for
itself
a
nearly
impossible
standard
to
meet
within
the
time
allotted
thus
the
commission
own
rules
act
as
a
material
deterrent
to
its
own
exercise
of
authority
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
and
core
principles
despite
all
of
these
shortcomings
the
proposal
preserves
for
dcms
the
existing
lax
procedural
safeguards
which
will
allow
for
listing
contracts
that
could
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
or
otherwise
not
comply
with
the
core
principles
rather
than
ensuring
compliance
with
the
law
and
core
principles
the
commission
invites
further
expansion
of
non
compliant
contracts
it
seems
naïve
to
assume
for
example
that
market
participants
will
no
longer
try
to
find
innovative
means
of
speculating
on
various
aspects
of
political
elections
and
policy
outcomes
there
is
an
infinite
variety
of
such
possibilities
worse
because
the
agency
has
given
itself
such
little
advance
notice
it
likely
would
not
be
able
to
intervene
until
after
a
product
is
listed
and
traded
at
that
point
the
agency
would
be
faced
with
the
prospect
of
creating
new
investor
and
market
harms
by
moving
to
stay
or
delist
the
product
the
commission
should
be
empowered
to
protect
the
markets
before
harm
is
done
that
is
prior
to
listings
or
rule
changes
taking
effect
recommendations
reviewing
dcm
commissioned
listings
and
rule
changes
is
a
core
responsibility
of
the
commission
and
is
critical
to
ensuring
the
integrity
of
its
regulated
markets
the
commission
should
review
and
analyze
all
dcm
listings
and
rule
filings
to
ensure
they
comply
with
the
law
and
core
principles
while
the
cea
expressly
authorizes
the
self
certification
process
it
does
not
preclude
the
agency
from
adopting
more
rigorous
safeguards
including
advanced
filings
of
listings
and
rules
changes
with
the
agency
formal
review
and
public
comment
seeking
processes
and
lengthier
time
horizons
for
action
congress
should
provide
funding
for
this
essential
responsibility
of
the
commission
conclusion
we
strongly
support
the
proposal
codification
of
the
prohibition
of
contracts
that
are
directly
or
indirectly
based
on
the
outcome
of
political
elections
as
well
as
the
additional
clarifications
around
gaming
other
enumerated
activities
and
assessment
of
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
parts
of
the
proposal
should
be
finalized
at
the
same
time
we
doubt
that
these
changes
will
reduce
the
burden
on
the
agency
to
review
dcm
filings
we
remain
concerned
that
the
agency
will
continue
its
excessive
dependence
upon
the
self
interested
and
conflicted
judgments
of
the
dcms
in
determining
what
potential
listings
comply
with
the
law
and
core
principles
to
address
this
concern
we
recommend
that
the
commission
expand
its
review
and
analysis
of
dcm
listings
and
rule
changes
and
seek
the
congressional
funding
necessary
to
accomplish
