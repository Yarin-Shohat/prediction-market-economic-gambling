first
it

second
it
must
determine
that
the

are
contrary
to
the
public

importantly
the

the
cftc
to
find
that
a
contract
meets
both
prongs
of
the
test
before
the
cftc
may
prohibit
its
listing
the
cftc
found
that
the
proposed
contracts
relate
to
both
gaming
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
and
that
the
proposed
contracts
are
contrary
to
the

interest
the
commission
order
however
deviates
from
the
legal
requirements
found
in
the

fails
to
consider
arguments
and
evidence
presented
to
the

during

and
fails
to
demonstrate
that
it
seriously
considered

that

final

the

both

including
those
offered
by

kalshi
and
risks
creating
chaos
in

for
these
reasons
the
order
should
be
found
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
argument
election
contracts
are
not
gaming
according
to
the
cftc
kalshi
proposed
contracts
are
akin
to
a
spin
of
a
roulette
wheel
a
game
of
chance
with
no
economic
utility
this
characterization
of
the
proposed
contracts
is
both
unsupported
within
the
order
and
is
out
of
sync
with
market
realities
the
cftc
order
found
that
the
proposed
contracts
constitute
gaming
which
the
cftc
defines
as
being
synonymous
with
gambling
betting
or
wagering
the
cftc
broadly
defines
these
terms
to
mean
that
the
relevant
statute
prohibits
risking
something
of
value
based
upon
the
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
of
a
future
event
or
a
contest
of
others
order
at

noting
that
many
regulated
futures
contracts
would
potentially
fit
this
definition
the
cftc
adds
that
gaming
by
definition
does
not
correlate
to
the
price
of
commodities
and
other
financial
instruments
order
at
10
the
cftc
then
claims
that
the
economic
impacts
of
the
outcome
of
contests
for
congressional
control
are
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
serve
the
hedging
and
risk
management
functions
that
futures
contracts
have
traditionally
been
intended
to
serve
the
proposed
contracts
serve
an
economic
purpose

kalshi

thus
are
not

to
a

a

there
is
clear
evidence
which
the
cftc
failed
to
substantively
address
as
required
by
the
apa
that
the
proposed

have
serious
economic
value
yes
there
are
steps
between

and
the

no
these
steps
do
not
eliminate
the

of

the
cftc
conclusion
is
in
error
and
its
mishandling
of
record
evidence
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
all
in

of
the

ii
the
cftc
is
improperly
substituting
an
economic

test
for
the
statutorily
mandated
public

test
after
finding
that
the
proposed
contracts
constituted
both
gaming
and
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
the
commission
was
required
by
the
statute
to
proceed
to
an
analysis
of
whether
the
proposed
contracts
were
within
the
public
interest

the
cftcciting

a

proceeded
to
describe
the

test
as
a
form
of
the
economic

test
that
was
in

of

deliberately

that
the

could
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging

on
more
than

basis

that

could

to
be

order
at

as
discussed
above
this
conclusion
is
in
error
and
this
court
should
reject
it
iii
the
proposed
contracts
are
within
the
public
interest
as
described
above
the
economic
purpose
of
the
proposed
contracts
has
already
been
extensively
demonstrated
to
the
commission
which
has
not
seriously
grappled
with
the
evidence
put
before
it
the
proposed
contracts
also
pass
the
public
interest
test
that
the
statute
requires
the
cftc
to
follow
in
particular
the
proposed
contracts
would
serve
the
public
interest
through
their
ability
to
generate
probabilities
of
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
future
events
in
the
context
of
elections
the
general
public
has
already
demonstrated
a
significant
interest
in
these
probabilities
when
event
contract
markets
such
as
predictit
and
kalshi
offer
contracts
for
sale
they
are
initially
offered
without
any
sale
price
attached
the
contracts
generate
prices
when
traders
one
buying
the
yes
side
of
the
contract
option
and
the
other
buying
the
no
side
agree
on
a
price
this
price
then
repeatedly
changes
over
the
course
of
the
life
of
the
contract
as
traders
digest
new
information
these
prices
continuously
reflect
the
probability
of
the
specified
event
outcome
occurring
and
they
reflect
the
consensus
of
the
wide
diversity
of
opinions
and
worldviews
of
a
diverse
pool
of
traders
this
is
the
essential
public

that
prediction

offer

the

claims
that
the

that
the

purpose
is
one
of

the

cites

the

also
notes
that

prohibit

at

for
the
cftc
the
fact
that
an
election
is
a
contest
of

is
enough
to
define
the

as
both
impermissible

and
impermissible

in

the

the

do
not
merely
extend
to
what
people
are
trading
on
but
can
extend
to

this
reading
fundamentally
deviates
from
the
cftc
interpretation
of
the

in

the

available
at
the
commission
fails
to
acknowledge
or
grapple
with
the
fact
that
its
disapproval
of
the
proposed
contracts
differs
from
its
longstanding
practices
the
future
sale
price
of
a
traditional
commodity
is
clearly
a
contingent
event
not
in
the
control
of
the
parties
to
a
futures
contract
under
the
reasoning
the
cftc
advances
in
the
order
nearly
every
transaction
regulated
by
the
commodity
exchange
act
would
be
in
violation
of
some
state
gaming
laws
the
cftc
arbitrary
interpretation
of
the
relevant
statute
risks
creating
havoc
in
regulated
event
markets
if
the
cftc
were
serious
about
its
interpretation
of
the
legal
standard
articulated
in
the
order
and
applied
it
consistently
elsewhere
it
would
undermine
the
rationale
for
every
market
regulated
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
as
nearly
all
futures
markets
may
in
some
way
involve
gaming
or
risk
overlapping
with
state
laws
nowhere
in
the
order
does
the
cftc
address
the
sweeping
consequences
of
the
order
interpretation
of
the
act
nor
does
the
cftc
attempt
to
reconcile
this
interpretation
with
decisions
it
has
made
and
contracts
it
has
allowed
in
the
past
the
cftc
order
fails
to
adequately
explain
how
it
is
that
kalshi
proposed
contracts
constitute
gaming
but
other
contracts
offered
on
dcms
do
not
both
of
these
shortcomings
define
the
arbitrary
decisionmaking
prohibited
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
cftc
must
provide
the
public
with
a
definition
of
gaming
that
it
can
consistently
and
non
arbitrarily
apply
to
proposed
contracts
it
has
not
done
so
the
commission
misunderstands
the
nature
of
the
proposed
contracts
nor
does
the
commission
stated
concern
that
approval
of
the
proposed
contracts
could
require
the
commission
to
election
related
activities
potentially
including
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
support
the
commission
decision
order
at

the
concern
fundamentally
misunderstands
the
proposed
contracts
that
the
commission
rejected
is
at
odds
with
the
commission
current
practices
and
is
contrary
to
evidence
in
the
rulemaking
record
the
commission
reliance
on
this
reason
for
rejection
of
the
proposed
contracts
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
the

the

is
arbitrary
capricious
and
otherwise
contrary
to

the
order
is
an
anomaly
in
the
current
regulatory
environment

the

to
explain
why
its

of

deviates
so
substantially
from
that
of

conclusion
that
the
proposed
contracts
lack
an
economic
purpose
is
both
unexplained
and
out
of
line
with
the
evidence
put
before
the
commission
the
order
misapplies
the
statutemandated
text
and
proceeds
to
misunderstand
both
the
value
and
the
nature
of

for
these
reasons
the

should
determine
that
