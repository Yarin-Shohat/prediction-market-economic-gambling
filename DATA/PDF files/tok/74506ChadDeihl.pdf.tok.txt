that
definitional
flaw
is
at
the
core
of
the
commission
misinterpreting
dodd
frank
kalshi
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
appreciate
the
nuances
between
gaming
and
gambling
but
its
statutory
interpretation
also
fails
because
it
is
unwilling
to
admit
that
congress
meant
gambling
not
gaming
below

the

understanding
of

what
is
a
game
games
are
isolated
events
disconnected
from
the
rest
of
life
as
early
as
1950
a
dutch
historian
explained
that
play
is
distinct
from
ordinary
life
both
as
to
locality
and
duration

we
found
that
one
of
the
most
important
characteristics
of
play
was
its
spatial
separation
from

space

marked
out

off
from

surroundings

roger
caillois
a
french
sociologist
agreed
in
effect
play
is
essentially
a
separate
occupation
carefully
isolated
from
the
rest
of
life
and
generally
is
engaged
in
with
precise
limits
of
time
and
place
there
is
place
for
play
as
needs
dictate
the
space
for
hopscotch
the
board
for
checkers
or
chess
the
stadium
the
racetrack
the
list
the
ring
the
stage
the
arena
etc
nothing
that
takes
place
outside
this
ideal
frontier
is
relevant
in
every
case
the
game
domain
is
therefore
a
restricted
closed
protected
universe
a
pure
space

caillois
consistently
underlined
the
spatial
separation
as
a
foundational
characteristic
of
a

certainly
can
not

one
might
argue
that
with
the
advances
in
technology
games
do
have
to
be
played
in
a
confined
space
anymore
it
is
true
that
advances
in
technology
allow
two
people
to
play
a
game
say
chess
even
when
they
are
not
within
a
confined
space
however
the
technology
simply
adds
another
mode
of
play
by
allowing
players
to
play
even
if
they
are
not
in
the
same
physical
space
the
game
still
does
not
spread
beyond
the
playing
field
it
is
just
that
the
technology
allows
the
playing
field
to
be
virtual
sometimes
critically
however
if
the
players
wished
to
bypass
technology
and
play
the
game
the
old
fashioned
way
they
still
could
that
is
if
two
siblings
in
the
same
house
wanted
to
play
chess
they
could
go
to
different
rooms
and
play
online
or
they
could
get
the
chessboard
out
and
play
the
difference
between
a
game
and
contest
seems
structural
more
than
anything
else
a
contest
is
often
between
individuals
that
will
be
ranked
according
to
some
measure
whereas
a
game
can
also
be
played
between
teams
further
a
contest
is
generally
considered
to
be
a
one
shot
event
whereas
a
game
can
be
played
repeatedly
like
roulette
in
any
event
nfi
does
believe
the
precise
distinction
between
a
game
and
contest
is
critical
for
the
questions
posed
in
the
proposed
rulemaking
because
dodd
frank
is
intended
to
cover
all
contracts
that
are
based
on
future
contingent
events
what
is
critical
is
that
i
games
contests
happen
in
a
confined
space
and
ii
participants
have
control
over
the
game
they
play
or
the
contest
they
compete
in
they
can
choose
not
to
play
or
compete
and
even
after
they
do
they
stop
playing
or
competing
they
can
leave
the
field
drop
out
of
a
race
etc

what
is
a
claim
aswath
damodaran
professor
of
finance
at
nyu
stern
school
of
business
defines
a
contingent
claim
as
follows
a
contingent
claim
or
option
is
an
asset
that
pays
off
only
under
certain
contingencies

in
a
narrow
sense
whenever
a
payoff
is
tied
explicitly
to
an
event
or
a
set
of
events
the
arrangement
can
be
characterized
as
a
claim
examples
include
binary
options
insurance
and
sports
bets
clearly
event
contracts
are
claims
under
even
this
narrower
definition
more
broadly
any
contract
where
the
payoff
is
dependent
on
future
events
whether
or
not
they
are
explicitly
defined
can
be
considered
as
a
claim
for
example
one
can
characterize
stocks
as
a
claim
on
residual
cash
flows
of
the
business
however
for
the
purposes
of
this
rulemaking
how
broad
the
definition
of
a
claim
is
not
relevant
3
when
does
a
game
or
contest
become
gambling
generally
speaking
when
it
comes
to
games
contests
gambling
occurs
when
prize
chance
and
consideration
are
present
assuming
prize
and
consideration
are
present
the
analysis
often
turns
on
whether
the
game
is
a
game
of
chance
or
game
of
skill
it
makes
intuitive
sense
that
a
sound
policy
would
encourage
skill
based
games
and
contests
but
distinguish
them
from
chance
games
that
do
not
contribute
much
to
society
other
than
entertaining
the
players
this
policy
effectively
requires
two
things
i
every
game
contest
is
placed
somewhere
along
the
skill
chance
spectrum
and
ii
the
governing
authority
defines
a
boundary
between
skill
and
chance
generally
qualitative
so
games
that
are
characterized
to
involve
less
than
the
skill
level
mapped
to
the
boundary
are
characterized
as
gambling
for
example
if
a
skill
game
is
defined
as
one
where
skill
should
be
more
predominant
than
chance
it
becomes
rather
straightforward
to
conclude
that
chess
is
a
skill
game
and
roulette
is
not
4
when
does
a
contingent
claim
become
gambling
the
relevant
question
is
which
contingent
claims
do
we
want
to
allow
to
be
traded
as
a
society
and
how
will
we
measure
them
similar
to
games
contingent
claims
can
be
used
purely
for
entertainment
purposes
or
they
can
serve
the
public
interest
to
the
extent
the
trading
of
those
claims
results
in
publicly
useful
pricing
information
provides
risk
management
opportunities
the
history
of
insurance
is
illuminating
in
this
respect
as
it
has
roots
in
gambling
as
posner
and
weyl
observed
in
eighteenth
century
england
people
would
buy
life
insurance
on
politicians
and
other
celebrities
so
that
if
the
named
person
died
the
purchaser
of
the
insurance
would
receive
a
payout
british
government
enacted
a
statute
that
introduced
the
insurable
interest
rule
to
insurance
markets
the
main
purpose
of
the
insurable
interest
rule
was
to
prevent
people
from
using
insurance
contracts
to
gamble
see
eric
posner
and
glen

the
late
cftc
commissioner
bart
chilton
would
make
a
somewhat
similar
observation
some
two
hundred
years
later
in
his
dissent
from
approval
of
media
derivatives
exchange
opening
weekend
motion
picture
revenue
futures
and
binary
option
contracts
dated
june
14
2010
in
interpreting
the
cea
we
are
to
exercise
some
modicum
of
common
sense
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
a
public
interest
in
deeming
some
thing
a
commodity
for
purposes
of
federal
on
exchange
derivatives
regulation
otherwise
the
statute
is
meaningless
unless
some
sensible
judgment
is
exercised
we
could
approve
terrorism
contracts
or
contracts
on
whether
a
certain
movie
star
will
die
or
become
disabled
or
contracts
on
the
likelihood
of
ufos
hitting
the
white
house
each
of
these
events
could
have
economic
consequences
but
it
is
hardly
appropriate
under
the
act
to
deem
them
commodities
to
say
that
simply
because
one
can
develop
a
futures
contract
the
underlying
is
a
commodity
is
circular
reasoning
at
best
using
this
analysis
anything
under
the
sun
could
be
a
commodity
if
you
could
at
some
time
in
the
future
have
a
futures
contract
on
it
we
know
that
is
not
how
congress
intended
for
us
to
interpret
the
act
available
at
accessed
on
august
8
2024
commissioner
chilton
was
misreading
the
statute
that
the
trading
of
these
contracts
is
not
desirable
does
not
mean
that
the
underlying
is
not
an
excluded
commodity
it
simply
means
that
these
contracts
were
not
deemed
to
provide
sufficient
public
benefits
recognizing
that
insurance
products
once
properly
designed
serve
a
bona
fide
economic
purpose
the
state
of
new
york
would
exempt
insurance
from
the
statutory
prohibition
on
gambling
in
1889
appellant
brief
in
white
cuomo
limiting
the
contract
to
certain
participants
may
have
worked
for
insurance
because
a
multitude
of
speculating
counterparties
continuously
trading
the
contract
are
not
needed
for
the
main
benefit
to
accrue
to
the
participant
paying
out
the
claim
if
the
unwanted
event
materializes
a
car
accident
more
specifically
one
speculating
counterparty
the
insurance
company
and
one
contract
with
that
counterparty
is
sufficient
event
contracts
do
not
have
that
luxury
for
price
discovery
risk
management
to
happen
trade
needs
to
be
continuous
and
speculators
are
needed
for
liquidity
thus
contracts
on
contingent
claims
need
go
through
a
similar
analysis
as
games
i
every
contract
needs
to
be
placed
somewhere
along
the
entertainment
purpose
spectrum
and
ii
the
governing
authority
needs
to
define
a
boundary
between
purpose
and
entertainment
which
may
be
qualitative
so
claims
that
are
characterized
to
involve
less
than
the
requisite
purpose
mapped
to
the
boundary
are
characterized
as
gambling
that
framework
already
existed
in
the
now
repealed
economic
purpose
test
the
only
sensible
interpretation
one
that
is
fully
supported
by
legislative
history
as
well
as
the
commission
previous
positions
is
that
notwithstanding
the
repeal
it
still
exists
today
why
that
must
be
the
case
is
discussed
further
below
in
section
5
what
is
the
definition
of
gambling
the
threshold
question
is
is
the
activity
a
game
or
a
claim
once
that
determination
is
made
the
gambling
evaluation
follows
using
the
frameworks
explained
above
a
simple
five
word
definition
of
gambling
is
as
follows
chance
games
and
entertainment
claims
this
simple
definition
produces
four
possible
outcomes
skill
games
not
gambling
chance
games
gambling
purpose
claims
not
gambling
and
entertainment
claims
gambling
thus
there
is
gaming
that
is
not
gambling
skill
games
and
there
is
gambling
not
gaming
entertainment
claims
6
who
has
regulatory
authority
over
gaming
generally
states
regulate
gaming
under
their
police
powers
they
decide
on
i
how
much
skill
is
needed
for
a
game
to
be
characterized
as
a
skill
game
and
ii
to
the
extent
a
game
is
characterized
as
a
chance
game
whether
that
game
will
be
offered
to
its
citizens
for
money
and
if
so
under
what
conditions
venues
limits
etc
thus
casino
games
that
are
chance
based
for
example
can
still
be
offered
to
the
citizens
but
would
be
explicitly
characterized
as
gambling
there
is
an
intuitive
reason
as
to
why
this
power
is
reserved
to
the
states
gaming
is
limited
to
a
physical
space
at
a
casino
for
example
the
gambling
activity
happens
on
the
casino
floor
if
a
fight
breaks
out
only
the
people
on
the
casino
floor
are
impacted
that
locality
is
consistent
with
the
use
of
police
powers
only
people
that
are
within
that
state
borders
are
involved
with
that
gambling
activity
so
it
is
natural
for
the
state
local
police
or
tribal
law
enforcement
to
have
jurisdiction
7
who
has
regulatory
authority
over
claims
congress
established
the
cftc
in
1974
and
tasked
it
with
overseeing
commodities
supplying
it
with
preemptive
federal
powers
the
legislative
history
of
the
cftc
act
of
1974
also
makes
it
clear
that
congress
intended
to
preempt
state
jurisdiction
over
the
transactions
that
the
act
covers
purcell
and
valdez
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
act
of
1974
regulatory
legislation
for
commodity
futures
trading
in
a
market
oriented
economy
21
dakota
rev

1976
thus
the
cftc
does
have
preemptive
jurisdiction
over
all
contingent
claims
unless
another
federal
regulator
has
jurisdiction
like
the
sec
in
large
part
the
commission
has
been
granted
that
authority
because
states
were
encroaching
into
the
federal
territory
opining
on
for
example
whether
or
not
derivatives
contracts
constitute
gambling
see
conaway
holding
that
thus
this
court
finds
that
the
alabama
gambling
statutes
if
construed
to
require
actual
delivery
would
directly
conflict
with
the
federal
purpose
of
fostering
the
markets
in
that
they
would
destroy
the
markets
in
this
state
and
that
congress
has
preempted

the
critical
distinction
between
a
game
and
a
claim
is
that
the
former
is
local
and
the
latter
is
not
a
trader
in
new
york
manipulating
a
coffee
futures
contract
may
very
well
impact
a
farmer
in
california
whereas
a
gambler
in
a
new
york
casino
who
has
been
counting
cards
at
the
blackjack
table
impacts
only
the
players
sitting
at
that
table
and
the
local
operations
of
that
casino
contingent
claim
trades

borders

that
an
understanding
of
the
events
that

is

a

there
are

was

that

is
simply
inconsistent
with
what
congress
intended
with
dodd

amidst
one
of
the
most
notable

in
the

dodd

was
not

to

to
eschew
robust

it
was
intended
to
increase
accountability
and
transparency
making
fewer
contracts
available
for

can
not
be

with
that
goal

as
a

discretion

armed
with
the

that

nfi
now
offers
the
correct
statutory
interpretation
of
dodd
frank
critically
this
interpretation
is
substantially
different
from
both
cftc
and
kalshi
in
particular
nfi
disagrees
with
the
cftc
interpretation
that
cea
section
is
a
two
step
process
the
commission
states
the
commission
interprets
cea
section
to
contemplate
that
the
commission
engage
in
a
two
step
inquiry
first
the
commission
must
assess
whether
a
contract
in
a
specified
excluded
commodity
an
activity
enumerated
in
cea
section
v
each
an
enumerated
activity
or
other
similar
activity
as
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
prescribed
similar
activity
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
involves
such
activity
the
commission
must
assess
whether
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
rather
it
best
understood
as
a
three
step
process
as
the
commission
recaps
cea
section
provides
that
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon

of
a

described
in

of
this
title
by

the
commission
may
determine
that
such

contracts
or

are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreements

or
transactions
involve
i
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
ii
terrorism
iii

or
vi
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by

or

to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
first
step
near
prohibition
captures
items
it
enumerates
activities
that
are
unlawful
and
specifically
calls
out
three
such
activities
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
discretion
step
involves
evaluating
a
wide
variety
of
contracts
that
do
not
involve
unlawful
activities
through
the
lens
of
the
now
repealed
economic
purpose
test
this
is
where
the
bulk
of
the
commission
activity
can
be
expected
to
happen
the
third
and
final
step
involves
assessing
for
contracts
that
were
deemed
to
serve
the
public
interest
from
a
contract
design
perspective
by
virtue
of
having
economic
purpose
whether
there
are
enough
protections
built
into
the
contract
position
limits
limitations
on
who
can
trade
the
contract
etc
step
1
near
prohibition
as
discussed
above
the
darpa
contracts
created
a
political
backlash
when
they
were
first
introduced
at
the
turn
of
the
century
the
idea
as
kalshi
correctly
noted
during
oral
argument
was
that
congress
is
concerned
about
people
from
profiting
bad
things
and
about
incentives
to
do
bad

this
interpretation
is
entirely
consistent
with
legislative
history
statements
of
diane
feinstein
and
blanche
lincoln
available
at
hereafter
the
exchange
feinstein
and
does
the
senator
agree
that
this
provision
will
also
empower
the
commission
to
prevent
trading
in
contracts
that
may
serve
a
limited
commercial
function
but
threaten
the
public
good
by
allowing
some
to
profit
from
events
that
threaten
our
national
security
lincoln
i
do
national
security
threats
such
as
a
terrorist
attack
war
or
hijacking
pose
a
real
commercial
risk
to
many
businesses
in
america
but
a
futures
contract
that
allowed
people
to
hedge
that
risk
would
also
involve
betting
on
the
likelihood
of
events
that
threaten
our
national
security
that
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
feinstein
i
thank
the
senator
for
including
this
provision
no
one
should
profit
by
speculating
on
the
likelihood
of
a
terrorist
attack
firms
facing
financial
risk
posed
by
threats
to
our
national
security
may
take
out
insurance
but
they
should
not
buy
a
derivative
a
futures
market
is
for
hedging
it
is
not
an
insurance
market
the
first
enumerated
item
is
a
catch
all
with
the
idea
being
anything
unlawful
in
at
least
one
state
for
example
if
child
labor
is
unlawful
for
children
under
the
age
of
sixteen
a
contract
that
pays
out
whether
a
certain
business
would
employ
child
labor
would
incentivize
that
business
to
actually
employ
child
labor
or
a
child
who
might
find
it
financially
beneficial
to
fake
their
real
age
it
makes
intuitive
sense
that
the
financial
markets
should
not
be
providing
such
perverse
incentives
to
market
participants
the
second
third
and
fourth
enumerated
items
are
just
specific
examples
by
enumerating
items
congress
signaled
that
there
should
be
heightened
interest
for
these
categories
to
be
clear
congress
did
not
prohibit
contracts
involving
these
items
hence
nfi
use
of
the
term
near
prohibition
on
that
note
there
might
be
a
reasonable
policy
position
that
all
such
contracts
could
be
deemed
prohibited
in
its
proposed
rulemaking
the
commission
requested
comment
on
whether
there
are
contracts
that
may
involve
terrorism
assassination
or
war
that
do
not
raise
the
above
described
public
interest
concerns
one
example
could
be
a
contract
on
whether
a
particular
terrorist
would
be
captured
before
a
certain
date
the
contract
presumably
involves
terrorism
and
if
it
is
prohibited
directly
it
would
not
provide
an
additional
incentive
to
someone
in
the
organization
to
turn
in
a
terrorist
to
the
law
enforcement
that
said
there
may
be
other
incentives
to
encourage
this
type
of
activity
outside
of
regulated
event
contract
markets
rewards
for
justice
and
a
broad
ban
relating
to
these
categories
may
not
necessarily
result
in
a
significant
public
benefit
loss
if
adopted
the
amended
policy
would
effectively
move
enumerated
items
from
near
prohibition
to
a
prohibition
stage
step
2
discretion
to
the
extent
a
contract
does
not
involve
an
unlawful
activity
or
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
in
the
contract
does
not
pose
an
elevated
risk
but
they
can
still
be
made
subject
to
the
commission
review
in
other
words
step
1
is
about
bad
acts
and
step
2
is
about
gambling
bad
acts
pose
serious
incentives
issues
and
thus
come
with
elevated
risks
anything
else
including
election
contracts
may
not
have
incentives
issues
that
are
that
serious
but
they
may
still
be
contrary
to
public
interest
legislative
history
is
entirely
consistent
with
this
dichotomy
senator
lincoln
noted
the
exchange
chairman
dodd
and
i
maintained
this
provision
in
the
conference
report
to
assure
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
futures
and
swaps
markets
that
would
allow
citizens
to
profit
from
devastating
events
and
also
prevent
gambling
through
futures
markets
emphasis
added
the
key
insight
here
is
that
congress
did
not
request
that
the
commission
review
every
single
contract
in
painstaking
detail
industry
participants
can
still
self
certify
after
all
kalshi
statement
if
you
sort
of
adopted
and
imported
the
broader
definition
of
gambling
and
treated
any
contract
that
involves
staking
something
of
value
on
a
contingency
or
on
an
uncertain
outcome
then
you
covered
the
waterfront
of
event
contracts
is
disingenuous
see
transcipt
17
if
what
is
self
certified
is
a
rather
standard
event
contract
where
the
public
benefits
are
obvious
the
commission
can
simply
choose
not
to
disturb
that
contract
at
the
same
time
usurping
the
authority
to
review
any
contract
from
the
commission
that
does
not
involve
enumerated
items
which
is
precisely
what
kalshi
is
suggesting
is
equally
pointless
under
that
interpretation
the
cftc
with
respect
to
event
contracts
at
least
serves
no
real
filtering
function
it
just
becomes
a
rubber
stamp
regulator
that
would
be
forced
to
regulate
whatever
ingenious
product
people
come
up
with
regardless
of
whether
they
serve
a
public
interest
or
not
that
ca
be
the
law
certainly
not
one
that
is
intended
to
to
protect
consumers
from
abusive
financial
services
practices
the
optimal
level
of
regulation
instead
is
somewhere
in
between
the
objective
is
to
arm
the
commission
with
the
discretion
to
review
contracts
that
can
potentially
cross
the
line
toward
gambling
if
deemed
so
those
contracts
would
not
serve
the
public
interest
a
few
remarks
are
in
order
congress
meant
gambling
not
gaming
for
starters
in
the
legislative
exchange
regarding
event
contracts
the
word
gambling
is
used
more
three
times
than
gaming
two
times
the
exchange
further
neither
kalshi
nor
the
cftc
position
that
congress
meant
gaming
not
gambling
is
supportable
kalshi
adopts
a
very
restrictive
approach
and
argues
that
gaming
means
games
casino
games
and
perhaps
also
sports
games
however
as
the
cftc
rightfully
points
out
it
never
explains
why
congress
simply
did
not
say
chance
games
or
sports
games
or
even
games
and
rather
said
gaming
with
the
in
the
end
enumerated
activities
are
all
nouns
v
is
a
gerund
a
verb
form
that
functions
as
a
noun
that
grammatical
break
is
not
a
coincidence
it
actually
signals
congress
intent
that
the
cea
section
analysis
itself
moved
one
stage
to
a
different
stage
from
near
prohibition
to
discretion
contracts
in
this
group
are
not
at
an
elevated
risk
of
providing
perverse
incentives
that
would
allow
citizens
to
profit
from
devastating
events
but
they
can
still
enable
gambling
the
cftc
on
the
other
hand
extends
the
definition
of
gaming
just
enough
so
it
conveniently
includes
elections
and
since
elections
are
not
games
the
cftc
is
effectively
forced
to
bring
contests
into
the
definition
as
well
as
commissioner
mersinger
correctly
points
out
this
mental
gymnastics
produces
weird
outcomes
such
as
taylor
swift
attending
a
kansas
city
chiefs
game
being
gambling
commissioner
mersinger
used
the
word
gaming
not
gambling
it
rephrased
here
consistent
with
nfi
reading
of
the
statute
and
legislative
goals
but
taylor
swift
attending
a
beyonce
concert
is
not
what
makes
the
commission
position
even
less
plausible
is
that
taylor
swift
attending
a
kansas
city
chiefs
game
is
arguably
related
to
more
material
economic
activity
that
may
make
industry
participants
want
to
hedge
certain
risks
than
taylor
swift
attending
any
concert
see
for
example
news
of
the
week
taylor
swift
has
generated
330
million
for
the
nfl
available
at
accessed
on
august
8
2024
this
simply
can
not
be
what
congress
had
in
mind
on
a
similar
note
kalshi
and
cftc
apparently
both
agree
that
a
game
is
not
related
to
significant
economic
activity
a
position
that
is
not
aligned
to
economic
reality
that
statement
could
be
true
for
a
random
poker
game
at
a
casino
but
the
nfl
alone
is
a
20
billion
dollar
business
as
such
contracts
that
involve
sporting
events
to
the
extent
that
do
not
constitute
gambling
could
serve
public
interest
in
sum
kalshi
narrows
the
definition
of
gambling
so
it
can
argue
for
eschewing
a
robust
regulatory
review
and
the
cftc
extends
it
just
enough
so
it
can
assert
jurisdiction
over
election
contracts
both
views
seem
to
be
opportunistic
that
are
intended
to
serve
the
parties
own
agendas
rather
than
actually
protecting
the
public
nor
do
they
pass
the
logic
test
the
most
natural
interpretation
one
that
is
consistent
with
legislative
history
is
that
gambling
under
the
cea
can
involve
a
contract
with
any
underlying
event
including
elections
weather
sports
games
and
practically
everything
else
none
of
these
contracts
are
gambling
automatically
but
they
ca
just
reach
the
market
without
a
review
with
the
commission
having
the
authority
to
determine
how
much
review
is
needed
this
begs
the
question
how
does
one
determine
which
claims
are
gambling
and
which
ones
are
not
assessment
criteria
measurements
evaluations
and
assessments
are
a
fact
of
life
one
tangential
example
is
mentioned
earlier
in
this
comment
letter
assuming
prize
and
consideration
are
present
the
analysis
as
to
whether
a
particular
game
constitutes
gambling
often
turns
on
whether
the
game
is
a
game
of
chance
or
game
of
skill
that
scala
naturally
requires
certain
judgment
calls
decisions
become
harder
especially
around
the
boundaries
where
both
skill
and
chance
are
present
such
as
the
game
of
poker
another
broad
based
example
is
education
a
teacher
has
to
decide
which
students
will
pass
the
class
and
which
students
will
fail
an
exam
with
a
score
of
100
is
obviously
a
pass
and
an
empty
answer
sheet
is
clearly
a
fail
between
those
two
extremes
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
outcomes
just
like
gaming
decisions
become
harder
especially
around
the
middle
people
can
agree
to
disagree
whether
a
particular
game
is
a
game
of
skill
or
game
of
chance
or
whether
a
particular
student
deserved
a
passing
grade
or
not
for
borderline
games
or
student
performances
especially
two
reasonable
people
can
come
out
on
either
side
of
the
scale
that
said
nobody
has
ever
seriously
questioned
that
some
assessment
criteria
is
needed
to
make
a
choice
which
by
its
nature
has
to
be
binary
a
contract
is
either
gambling
or
it
is
not
the
inherent
tension
underlying
all
of
these
cases
is
that
a
continuous
scale
must
be
utilized
to
make
a
binary
choice
and
whatever
is
being
evaluated
games
exams
or
contracts
that
tend
to
cluster
around
what
must
be
a
rather
subjective
boundary
are
ripe
for
disagreement
as
anyone
who
has
ever
attended
a
performance
review
at
work
can
attest
the
star
employees
and
the
complete
failures
are
easy
consensus
decisions
the
majority
of
the
review
and
discussion
time
is
spent
on
borderline
cases
arguably
election
market
contracts
fit
squarely
into
this
category
admittedly
the
commission
finds
itself
in
a
very
difficult
position
because
the
economic
purpose
test
was
repealed
depriving
it
of
its
main
assessment
tool
as
the
senators
noted
the
commodity
futures
modernization
act
of
2000
stripped
the
cftc
of
this
authority
at
the
urging
of
industry
the
exchange
congress
took
away
the
only
sensible
scale
the
commission
had
if
state
governments
declared
that
skill
chance
can
not
be
considered
anymore
in
whether
or
not
determining
a
certain
game
is
gambling
or
not
gaming
regulators
would
be
helpless
similarly
if
congress
made
it
illegal
to
use
a
pass
fail
grading
system
teachers
all
around
the
country
would
throw
their
hands
in
the
air
or
create
picket
lines
what
is
the
commission
actually
supposed
to
do
when
it
has
the
mandate
from
congress
to
to
protect
consumers
from
abusive
financial
services
practices
but
is
not
given
a
tool
for
decision
making
if
congress
really
intended
to
momentarily
take
that
authority
away
from
the
commission
it
has
backfired
and
arguably
contributed
to
the
great
recession
in
response
congress
restored
the
authority
back
to
the
commission
and
did
so
pretty
quickly
by
legislative
standards
within
a
decade
it
is
inconceivable
to
think
that
congress
when

kalshi
position
that
the

does
not
even
reach
election
contracts
because
they
are
not
an
enumerated
activity
is
aggrandizing
and
self
serving
at
best
none
of
this
is
to
say
that

do
not
pose
difficult
questions
there
is
arguably
some
economic

in

nfi
does
not

serve
the
public

saying
that

not

assessment

makes

step

protection
hypothetically
speaking
let
assume
two
designated
contract
markets
seek
the
approval
for
or
self
certify
an
event
contract
as
to
which
country
will
host
the
olympics
as
commissioner
mersinger
rightfully
points
out
in
her
dissenting
statement
these
contracts
when
properly
designed
have
the
potential
to
serve
public
interest
let
further
assume
that
one
of
the
contract
proposals
have
limitations
on
who
can
trade
the
contract
and
prohibits
among
others
the
members
of
the
selection
committee
from
trading
the
contracts
whereas
the
other
imposes
no
such
restrictions
a
similar
hypothetical
was
posed
by
the
district
court
in
kalshiex
llc
cftc
but
under
your
argument
because
elections
do
fall
according
to
you
in
those
categories
there
no
occasion
for
cftc
to
even
reach
these
safeguards
so
presumably
someone
could
post
an
event
contract
similarly
to
what
your
client
does
another
dcm
could
do
this
without
any
of
those
safeguards
and
it
my
understanding
that
under
your
framework
cftc
would
not
have
any
interest
in
that
inconceivably
kalshi
agreed
and
casually
offered
that
there
may
be
other
provisions
that
may
come
into
play
transcript
5
when
the
court
cleverly
took
kalshi
position
to
its
natural
conclusion
all
kalshi
could
do
was
suggest
that
some
unknown
provisions
elsewhere
in
the
code
could
come
to
the
rescue
that
alone
is
a
strong
signal
that
kalshi
statutory
interpretation
that
turns
the
cftc
into
a
rubber
stamp
regulator
does
not
pass
muster
the
interpretation
advanced
in
this
brief
by
nfi
is
much
more
sensible
under
that
interpretation
this
final
step
not
only
makes
room
for
other
contracts
but
also
acts
as
a
final
catch
all
that
can
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
contracts
that
serve
public
interest
as
a
package
from
those
that
do
with
this
provision
the
commission
has
a
tool
right
in
the
middle
of
the
statute
and
not
in
some
unknown
corner
to
differentiate
contracts
that
come
with
different
safeguards
even
if
they
are
wrapped
around
what
is
otherwise
an
identical
contract
design
notwithstanding
the
traditional
view
that
commodities
markets
have
inside
information
there
is
a
fundamental
fairness
issue
it
is
an
open
question
whether
as
the
contracts
on
excluded
commodities
insider
trading
becomes
more
of
a
concern
similar
to
stock
market
intuitively
this
makes
sense
a
farmer
certainly
knows
more
about
the
status
of
his
orange
harvest
that
year
than
a
trader
sitting
at
a
desk
in
new
york
city
presumably
he
does
know
much
in
the
big
scheme
traditional
commodities
are
managed
locally
but
there
is
a
global
market
for
them
a
member
of
the
olympic
committee
however
has
both
local
and
global
knowledge
which
resembles
more
insider
information
that
may
be
possessed
by
a
few
insiders
c
suite
a
few
additional
remarks
are
offered
below
regarding
nfi
statutory
interpretation
of
dodd
frank
and
why
it
makes
more
sense
that
the
alternative
interpretations
offered
by
kalshi
and
the
commission
under
nfi
interpretation
the
statutory
analysis
follows
a
logical
funnel
like
process
in
the
first
step
any
contract
that
incentivizes
bad
acts
is
marked
as
having
an
elevated
risk
if
they
clear
step
2
and
step
3
they
can
still
reach
the
market
but
it
is
clear
that
the
bar
is
much
higher
again
this
makes
sense
in
the
context
of
the
political
backlash
around
the
darpa
contracts
any
other
contract
is
a
potential
candidate
to
reach
the
market
provided
that
they
are
deemed
to
serve
public
interest
by
i
possessing
enough
economic
purpose
through
an
application
of
the
economic
purpose
test
and
ii
by
having
the
proper
safeguards
essentially
the
commission
is
entitled
to
two
bites
of
the
apple
analyzing
not
just
the
contract
design
itself
but
also
the
trading
design
this
interpretation
is
consistent
with
legislative
history
and
is
perfectly
aligned
with
the
economic
circumstances
congress
launched
in
the
form
of
the
dodd
frank
act
it
is
one
where
the
public
interest
determination
is
naturally
weaved
into
the
statute
as
opposed
to
being
a
secondary
step
it
also
one
where
the
determination
of
public
interest
for
both
contract
design
and
trading
design
can
be
accomplished
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statute
not
buried
within
some
unknown
alley
of
a
separate
statute
kalshi
interpretation
does
not
work
because
it
turns
the
commission
into
a
helpless
rubber
stamp
regulator
a
perfect
example
is
when
a
dcm
self
certifies
a
contract
that
is
contingent
on
what
color
dress
taylor
swift
will
wear
next
week

under
kalshi
interpretation
the
commission
simply
ca
reach
this
event
contract
the
commission
interpretation
does
not
fare
any
better
its
response
is
essentially
admitting
that
it
has
no
say
on
the
taylor
swift
dress
color
event
contract
unless
taylor
swift
wears
that
dress
to
a

city
chiefs

in

case
the

therefore
gaming
therefore
the
commission
has
the
authority
to
review
and
presumably
prohibit
the
dcm
from
listing
and
trading
that
contract
alternatively
if
some
state
gaming
regulator
disallows
the
taylor
swift
dress
contract
worn
anywhere
the
commission
regains
the
authority
to
review
because
the
activity
now
involves
an
unlawful
activity
effectively
one
funny
state
law
has
the
potential
to
impact
what
the
cftc
can
or
can
not
do
more
so
than

telling

much
more
sensible
outcome
what

dress
taylor
swift
wears
regardless
of
where

wears
it
serves
no
economic

and
falls
much
closer
to
the

of
the
spectrum
assuming
the

unprincipled

commissioner

the
proposal
sweeps
in
the
universe
of

in

broadly
define
as

every

of
whether
it
has
any
bearing
on
the
outcome

or
the
performance
of

in

is
wholly
unwarranted
nfi
that
a
particular

has
no
bearing
on

not

every

should
be
evaluated
on

hard
work
needed
commissioner
mersinger
i
recognize
that
a
contract
specific
approach
to
making
public
interest
determinations
regarding
event
contracts
may
be
difficult
and
resource
intensive
for
the
cftc
but
aside
from
my
view
that
a
contract
specific
approach
is
required
by
the
cea
it
also
is
a
better
approach
from
a
policy
perspective
precisely
because
it
would
permit
the
cftc
to
consider
these
practical
questions
in
the
context
of
the
specific
circumstances
applicable
to
a
particular
event
contract
we
do
not
get
to
override
a
requirement
under
the
law
because
it
will
be
hard
or
require
more
work
for
us
nfi
the
commission
is
tasked
with
executing
on
the
mandate
from
congress
consumers
from
abusive
financial
services
practices
is
meant
to
be
hard
work
congress
asked
for
it
and
if
the
commission
needs
more
resources
then
asking
congress
for
additional
resources
would
be
a
much
better
approach
than
interpreting
the
statute
narrowly
despite
congress
not
prescribing
that
narrow
view
to
optimize
its
existing
resources
nfi
strongly
disagrees
with
commissioner
mersinger
on
the
following
points
how
to
interpret
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
enumerate
elections
commissioner
mersinger
congress
easily
could
have
included
elections
and
awards
as
enumerated
activities
but
it
did
not
confronted
with
this
congressional
silence
i
do
not
believe
the
commission
can
simply
decree
that
elections
and
awards
are
enumerated
activities
nfi
perhaps
the
commission
can
not
enumerate
an
activity
but
it
does
not
need
to
instead
it
can
simply
issue
a
scorecard
on
election
contracts
as
it
would
for
any
other
contract
by
relying
on
the
economic
purpose
test
and
determine
whether
or
not
such
contracts
constitute
gambling
congress
silence
means
only
one
thing
that
congress
trusts
the
cftc
to
do
the
job
in
simple
terms
one
can
hypothesize
that
congress
mandate
was
rather
simple
and
intuitive
we
can
visualize
congres
saying
pay
attention
to
terrorism
assassination
and
war
and
for
any
other
contract
where
the
payout
is
contingent
on
an
unlawful
activity
we
do
want
to
provide
the
wrong
incentives
anything
else
you
should
take
a
look
and
feel
free
to
review
more
thoroughly
if
there
are
borderline
cases
finally
please
make
sure
there
are
safeguards
in
place
even
when
the
contracts
have
economic
purpose
commissioner
mersinger
there
is
no
basis
to
resurrect
the
repealed
economic
purpose
test
which
should
be
applied
to
event
contracts
in
any
event
nfi
this
is
our
biggest
disagreement
with
the
commissioner
commissioner
mersinger
denounces
the
economic
purpose
test
by
arguing
i
lack
of
congressional
intent
ii
difference
in
kind
iii
government
paternalism
and
iv
application
to
categories
of
contracts
we
address
each
point
in
turn
i
perhaps
congressional
intent
could
have
been
clearer
but
there
are
certainly
strong
signs
of
it
even
more
importantly
what
is
the
alternative
the
commissioner
does
not
really
offer
any
other
than
pointing
to
a
separate
process
of
detailed
rulemaking
down
the
road
but
the
restoration
of
the
economic
purpose
test
offers
a
much
simpler
solution
it
implies
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
here
and
now
within
the
four
corners
of
the
dodd
frank
act
as
mentioned
earlier
the
commission
not
having
access
to
the
economic
purpose
test
is
akin
to
a
teacher
not
having
the
ability
to
issue
pass
fail
grades
ii
that
event
contracts
are
different
from
traditional
futures
contracts
is
not
a
reason
to
eliminate
the
best
tool
the
commission
had
it
is
true
that
the
application
of
it
may
be
a
little
different
perhaps
price
discovery
rather
than
price
basing
becomes
more
important
in
the
case
of
excluded
commodities
as
opposed
to
the
traditional
ones
and
perhaps
the
potential
hedger
populations
look
slightly
different
that
does
mean
that
one
ca
still
broadly
look
to
the
fundamental
principle
of
public
interest
iii
it
is
true
that
participants
should
be
permitted
to
make
their
own
choices
about
what
financial
products
meet
their
hedging
needs
but
we
disagree
that
it
is
not
the
cftc
role
to
deny
them
that
choice
altogether
because
we
feel
a
given
product
hedging
value
is
limited
if
it
not
the
cftc
whose
role
is
it
should
all
products
simply
allowed
to
trade
because
there
might
be
a
few
hedgers
in
a
pool
of
million
speculators
and
there
is
no
meaningful
price
discovery
in
any
event
there
is
evidence
of
industry
participants
advocating
for
their
needs
and
making
a
difference
when
a
hearing
was
held
for
the
box
office
movie
futures
nfi
recalls
that
there
was
a
film
financier
who
passionately
argued
why
such
contracts
should
be
allowed
despite
strong
opposition
by
the
mpaa
those
contracts
were
voted
to
reach
the
market
3
2
with
then
chair
gary
gensler
being
the
deciding
vote
ironically
they
were
later
outlawed
by
congress
in
short
there
can
be
other
ways
for
true
hedgers
to
advocate
for
their
needs
and
make
a
difference
iv
nfi
agrees
with
commissioner
mersinger
that
making
public
interest
determinations
for
event
contracts
by
category
does
not
make
sense
in
sum
if
the
commission
is
going
to
do
the
hard
work
it
should
also
be
afforded
the
tools
to
do
the
hard
work
the
economic
purpose
test

pham
dissent
commissioner
pham
states
i
certainly
do
want
the

and
other

commissioner
pham
seems
to
have
it
backwards
and
seems
to
be
conflating
regulation
with
asserting
jurisdiction
nobody
perhaps
other
than
erisx
which
effectively
tried
to
backdoor
sports
gambling
through
the
cftc
by
disingenuously
arguing
that
the
contracts
have
economic
purpose
is
suggesting
that
the
commission
should
register
las
vegas
sportsbooks
and
other
betting
venues
instead
the
commission
should
evaluate
whether
sports
betting
contracts
should
be
characterized
as
swaps
event
contracts
nfi
believes
that
is
the
case
for
both
however
a
detailed
analysis
of
why
sports
betting
contracts
and
even
daily
fantasy
sports
should
be
characterized
as
swaps
is
beyond
the
scope
of
this
comment
letter
and
if
it
believes
it
does
should
assert
jurisdiction
from
a
layman
perspective
it
does
not
make
intuitive
sense
why
the
commission
could
have
such
strong
opinions
and
clear
jurisdiction
on
whether
a
particular
candidate
will
win
the
elections
but
not
on
whether
a
particular
team
will
win
the
super
bowl
if
the
mere
answer
is
that
the
cftc
is
not
willing
to
take
a
stance
against
a
powerful
sports
betting
lobby
the
answer
seems
political
not
principled
core
to
commissioner
pham
thesis
seems
to
be
the
premise
that
gaming
is
a
power
reserved
to
the
states
as
mentioned
earlier
we
fully
agree
where
we
disagree
is
the
characterization
of
sports
betting
as
gaming
it
gambling
not
gaming
and
that
subtle
but
crucial
distinction
flips
who
has
jurisdiction
is
football
an
excluded
commodity
at
least
one
cftc
commissioner
thought
so
when
we
think
of
commodities
we
think
of
tangible
things
oil
corn
gold
there
are
intangible
commodities
too
most
of
which
have
a
connection
to
the
financial
system
like
a
broad
stock
index
500
or
a
borrowing
rate
libor
but
what
about
an
event
an
election
whether
the
summer
olympics
will
occur
in
japan
a
football
game
those
too
are
commodities
statement

brian
quintenz
on
erisx
rsbix
nfl

and
certain

are
sports
bets
claims
on
future
contingent
events
they
certainly
are
that
puts
them
squarely
within
the
cftc
jurisdictional
perimeter
at
times
the
commission
seems
to
suggest
that
it
only
cares
about
sports
betting
contracts
not
trading
on
registered
exchanges
as
opposed
to
any
venue
certainly
that
creates
the
wrong
incentives
to
market
participants
all
kalshi
would
need
to
do
is
create
a
new
entity
and
offer
election
contracts
trading
at
least
in
states
that
do
not
disallow
it
that
simply
ca
be
an
outcome
the
commission
would
be
comfortable
with
in
addition
the
commission
has
already
taken
action
against
various
unregistered
exchanges
in
the
past
and
to
not
do
so
against
sport
betting
platforms
seems
to
be
a
selective
enforcement
activity
thus
the
fact
that
the
cftc
picked
a
battle
with
election
contracts
but
not
sports
betting
or
daily
fantasy
sports
operators
appears
to
be
guided
by
political
choices
not
by
principles
if
trading
entertainment
contracts
on
a
dcm
is
the
problem
then
market
participants
can
simply
go
elsewhere
and
offer
the
contracts
that
the
cftc
does
not
like
if
the
commission
attacks
that
structure
the
operators
can
then
argue
rightfully
that
election
markets
at
least
offer
some
benefits
and
sports
betting
and
daily
fantasy
sports
do
the
hard
work
that
commissioner
pham
mersinger
point
to
is
not
just
in
reviewing
every
contract
it
is
also
in
enforcing
the
law
uniformly
anything
short
of
that
will
likely
accelerate
a
heavy
litigation
cycle
where
the
american
public
will
become
the
biggest
losers
