re
public
comment
on
kalshi
proposed
will
be
in
control
of
the
of
contracts
pursuant
to
commission
regulation
dear
commissioners
i
am
writing
to
strongly
support
the
approval
of
congressional
control
contracts
by
kalshi
ex
llc
as
lecturer
in
the
mathematics
department
at
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
i
teach
financial
mathematics
and
statistics
courses
the
contribution
of
the
kalshi
exchange
trading
in
event
contracts
is
highly
significant
in
providing
the
public
and
financial
markets
with
explicit
wisdom
of
crowds
participants
choosing
to
trade
contracts
based
on
their
price
is
the
scientific
way
to
communicate
their
beliefs
concerning
the
likelihood
of
the
associated
events
in
addition
to
providing
direct
value
to
traders
in
the
contracts
the
public
and
financial
markets
benefit
from
the
information
conveyed
by
the
dynamics
of
trading
and
prices
in
the
contracts
such
activity
supports
efficiency
in
financial
markets
with
the
enhanced
information
flow
of
trading
on
a
regulated
exchange
i
have
been
registered
with
the
cftc
for
many
years
as
commodity
pool
operator
and
now
as
a
commodity
trading
adviser
the
importance
of
regulated
exchanges
to
ensure
the
integrity
and
fairness
of
trading
in
financial
markets
is
highly
significant
i
have
been
a
long
term
advocate
for
kalshi
in
their
pursuit
of
registering
the
exchange
with
the
cftc
in
that
capacity
i
am
an
outside
independent
director
on
the
company
risk
oversight
committee
based
on
my
experience
and
perspective
i
offer
below
comments
on
several
of
the
public
questions
posted
in
support
of
congressional
control
contracts
yours
truly
peter
kempthorne
comments
on
selected
public
questions
posted
concerning
the
congressional
control
contracts
1
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
gaming
as
described
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
comment
the
underlying
activity
of
the
contracts
is
political
control
this
activity
is
not
one
of
the
excluded
activities
in
regulation
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
or
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
while
such
contracts
involve
betting
on
an
event
outcome
the
outcomes
of
such
bets
are
not
purely
random
as
in
casino
games
or
akin
to
sports
betting
for
which
the
public
interest
could
be
challenged
instead
the
congressional
control
contracts
provide
a
way
for
the
public
to
communicate
and
share
their
expectations
about
congressional
control
such
contract
trading
would
have
no
direct
impact
on
the
outcome
but
indirectly
the
wisdom
of
crowds
would
serve
the
public
interest
by
helping
to
anticipate
congressional
composition
and
prepare
for
the
impact
of
alternate
outcomes
2
should
the
commission
consider
whether
similar
offerings
are
available
in
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
whether
taking
a
position
on
elections
or
congressional
control
is
defined
as
gaming
under
state
or
federal
law
comment
while
traditional
gaming
venues
such
as
casinos
or
sports
books
might
allow
similar
offerings
these
do
not
serve
the
public
interest
allowing
congressional
control
contracts
on
the
kashi
exchange
would
serve
the
public
interest
by
providing
a
completely
equitable
transparent
market
for
such
contracts
moreover
providing
such
contracts
on
a
central
exchange
where
the
public
can
know
and
research
the
trading
activity
would
support
increasing
the
liquidity
of
such
contracts
enabling
the
public
with
contract
positions
to
adjust
or
close
their
contract
positions
efficiently
in
both
time
and
cost
such
public
interest
features
are
not
available
at
casinos
or
sports
books
6
do
the
contracts
serve
a
hedging
function
are
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
based
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedged
directly
by
the
contracts
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrates
the
hedging
utility
of
the
contracts
comment
these
contracts
definitely
serve
a
hedging
function
for
individuals
and
investors
their
employment
circumstance
and
opportunities
can
depend
significantly
on
the
political
side
with
congressional
control
providing
the
ability
to
hedge
alternate
outcomes
could
have
significant
value
to
affected
individuals
also
the
investment
prospects
of
stocks
or
bonds
in
companies
can
depend
significantly
on
congressional
control
renewable
vs
fossil
fuel
energy
companies
electronic
vehicle
and
battery
manufacturers
the
congressional
control
contracts
would
provide
additional
investment
options
to
individuals
which
could
diversify
and
lower
their
exposures
to
identifiable
financial
risks
7
are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
comment
the
traditional
derivative
products
focus
on
the
risks
of
existing
underlying
assets
of
the
derivatives
the
impact
of
congressional
control
is
more
broad
based
with
a
congressional
control
contract
such
risks
would
be
directly
tradable
making
the
amorphous
impact
direct
and
tradable
8
what
standard
should
the
commission
use
in
reviewing
the
contact
hedging
function
is
it
sufficient
that
a
contract
could
theoretically
be
used
for
hedging
or
should
an
exchange
provide
evidence
of
demonstrated
need
by
likely
hedgers
in
the
market
how
often
must
a
contract
be
used
for
hedging
or
what
percentage
of
market
participants
or
open
interest
must
represent
hedging
use
comment
the
hedging
function
of
congressional
control
contracts
can
only
be
determined
through
their
use
as
actively
traded
contracts
the
proof
of
demonstrated
need
by
likely
hedgers
would
likely
not
come
until
the
active
and
liquid
market
for
such
contracts
is
available
to
the
general
public
while
premature
an
interesting
question
is
whether
the
position
limits
for
such
contracts
could
be
raised
for
participants
self
designating
themselves
as
hedgers
such
market
activity
would
be
feasible
when
trading
in
such
a
contract
reaches
maturity
with
sufficient
liquidity
11
do
the
contracts
serve
a
price
basing
function
for
example
could
they
form
the
basis
of
pricing
a
commercial
transaction
in
a
physical
commodity
financial
asset
or
service
comment
as
noted
in
question
6
the
investment
potential
of
stocks
and
bonds
of
companies
can
be
significantly
affected
by
the
outcome
of
the
congressional
control
contract
the
risks
of
which
political
party
is
in
congressional
control
could
have
an
important
impact
on
pricing
commercial
transactions
in
such
assets
or
of
related
commodities
in
addition
to
the
direct
payoffs
of
such
contracts
their
information
value
in
terms
of
market
insight
sentiment
wisdom
would
contribute
to
pricing
and
trading
in
these
other
assets
12
are
the
proposed
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
why
or
why
not
comment
the
congressional
control
contracts
are
definitely
in
the
public
interest
they
provide
two
key
contributions
1
the
ability
to
trade
contracts
on
event
outcomes
for
individuals
directly
affected
by
the
event
and
2
the
information
content
of
informed
active
traders
about
the
likelihood
of
the
contract
event
for
use
and
consumption
by
the
general
public
16
should
campaign
committees
political
action
committees
candidates
for
the
house
and
senate
and
other
entities
involved
in
political
fundraising
and
expenditures
or
likely
to
hold
non
public
information
or
subject
to
federal
election
commission
oversight
be
prohibited
from
participating
in
the
contracts
would
such
a
prohibition
help
address
federal
campaign
law
or
manipulation
and
surveillance
concerns
how
would
such
restrictions
impact
the
commission
determination
of
whether
the
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
comment
these
possible
prohibitions
could
be
important
in
maintaining
the
integrity
of
the
market
in
such
contracts
i
would
support
such
prohibitions
as
supporting
the
public
interest
objectives
of
the
commission
