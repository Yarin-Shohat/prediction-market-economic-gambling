event
contracts
nprm
as
further
explained
herein
paradigm
has
significant
concern
that
the
event
contracts
nprm
represents
a
broad
and
untethered
ban
on
a
wide
variety
of
products
that
could
further
the
goals
of
the
cea
to
promote
responsible
innovation
see
cea
section
unfortunately
the
approach
set
forth
in
the
event
contracts
nprm
is
to
ban
most
types
of
event
contracts
without
conducting
any
review
of
the
terms
of
the
particular
event
contracts
developing
an
understanding
of
the
hedging
utility
of
the
products
or
otherwise
evaluating
the
merits
of
prediction
markets
as
innovative
derivatives
platforms
that
further
democratic

the

instead
chooses

as
further
explained
below
paradigm
urges
the
cftc
to
withdraw
the
event
contracts
nprm
and
reconsider
its
approach
for
the
following
reasons
1
the
event
contracts
nprm
would
outlaw
a
broad
class
of
innovative
derivatives
products
before
market
participants
have
had
an
opportunity
to
fully
realize
their
benefits
the
cftc
decision
to
exile
these
products
to
minimally
regulated
offshore
and
over
the
counter
markets
will
impair
opportunities
for
financial
innovation
domestically
2
the
cftc
proposal
is
less
motivated
by
an
earnest
desire
to
protect
the
public
than
an
aversion
to
event
contracts
generally
as
further
explained
below
the
cftc
misinterprets
a
senate
colloquy
addressing
cea
section
in
a
manner
that
is
at
odds
with
the
plain
language
and
purpose
of
the
statute
moreover
the
cftc
failed
to
perform
the
analysis
required
under
section
in
excess
of
the
agency
statutory
jurisdiction
3
the
cftc
proposal
adopts
a
definition
of
the
term
gaming
that
is
profoundly
unclear
and
does
not
provide
any
articulable
standards
that
would
allow
for
a
market
participant
to
determine
whether
or
not
an
event
contract
involves
such
activity
this
level
of
regulatory
vagueness
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
4
political
event
contracts
offer
a
plethora
of
concrete
benefits
that
the
event
contracts
nprm
fails
to
adequately
consider
broadly
these
types
of
event
contracts
can
encourage
participation
in
the
democratic
process
and
promote
trust
in
its
legitimacy
additionally
political
event
contracts
allow
businesses
to
hedge
risks
associated
with
a
wide
range
of
political
and
electoral
factors
should
the
cftc
decide
not
to
withdraw
the
event
contracts
nprm
it
should
at
the
very
least
narrow
the
scope
of
the
definition
of
gaming
as
explained
below
and
remove
any
public
interest
determination
from
the
rule
the
single
worst
move
the
cftc
could
make
is
to
let
this
rule
proceed
without
changes
that
is
the
definition
of
a
risky
gamble
the
event
contracts
nprm
is
a
value
based
subjective
regulation
that
would
outlaw
innovative
products
and
drive
burgeoning
financial
technology
businesses
offshore
the
event
contracts
nprm
proposes
to
interpret
section
of
the
cea
which
provides
that
the
cftc
may
determine
that
an
event
contract
that
involves
an
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
enumerated
activities
listed
in
the
statute
include
an
activity
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
and
other
similar
activities
determined
by
the
cftc
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
event
contracts
nprm
the
cftc
concluded
that
any
contract
that
involves
an
enumerated
activity
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
can
not
legally
be
offered
for
trading
or
cleared
on
a
cftc
registered
platform
as
explained
further
herein
the
cftc
interpretation
of
cea
section
is
inconsistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
not
provide
sufficient
analysis
to
allow
the
public
to
provide
informed
comment
and
is
excessively
broad
so
as
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
structure
of
the
cea
prior
to
addressing
the
numerous
deficiencies
with
the
event
contracts
nprm
paradigm
submits
that
it
is
important
for
the
cftc
to
recognize
its
role
in
regulating
markets
the
cftc
is
not
a
value
based
regulator
as
a
general
matter
the
cea
does
not
authorize
the
commission
to
impose
its
value
judgements
on
whether
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
rather
congress
generally
saw
fit
for
the
financial
markets
the
exchanges
in
particular
to
determine
those
products
that
furthered
the
public
interest
by
virtue
of
being
consistent
with
regulatory
core
principles
promoting
price
discovery
risk
management
and
other
considerations
in
this
regard
cea
section
should
be
read
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
overarching
statute
an
overly
broad
reading
of
this
section
authorizing
the
cftc
to
make
a
public
interest
determination
would
circumvent
the
intent
of
congress
for
the
markets
to
generally
determine
whether
a
contract
is
in
the
public
interest
moreover
the
event
contracts
nprm
is
inconsistent
with
the
cftc
stated
pro
innovation
agenda
in
cftc
chairman
behnam
recent
testimony
to
the
senate
committee
on

subcommittee
on
financial

yet
the
cftc
proposal
would
effectively
outlaw
some
of
the
most
innovative
financial
markets
in
the
united

and
drive
a
burgeoning
industry
of
financial
technology
businesses
and
entrepreneurs
offshore
such
a

would
take
place
without
the
cftc
or
its

evaluating
the

of
a

as
contemplated
in
the

the

may
determine
that
such

or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the

emphasis
added
cea

indeed
the
cftc
seeks
to
dictate
the
types
of
financial

and

that
are
suitable
for
it
to
regulate
and
therefore
be
permitted
to
exist
in
the

those
financial
markets
and
businesses
that
the

does
not
wish
to

be

the
cftc
complains
that
it
does
not
have
the
specialized

it

that

urges
the

to
reconsider
this
flawed
approach
that
as
set
forth
below
lacks
meaningful
analysis
as
we
have
seen
with
crypto
asset

a
failure
on
the
part
of
regulators
to
meaningfully
engage
with
innovative

businesses
will
simply
cause
these

to
move
offshore
outside
of
the
reach
of
the
commission
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
american
public
the

would
cede
this

to
offshore
jurisdictions
over

to
hedge

risk
associated
with

consequence

as
the
result
of
a
political

the
cftc
proposal
to

will
simply
mean
that
the
cftc
has
no
influence
upon
the
global
regulatory
framework
for

paradigm
submits
that
congress
intended
for
cftc

to
have
the
freedom
to
offer
innovative
financial
products
involving
any

under
the
regulatory
supervision
of

factual
record
and
reasoned
analysis
that

does
not
authorize
the
cftc
to
ban
certain
event
contracts
without
reviewing
the

understanding
the

section
to
prohibit
an

from

a

organization
from

any

that
involves
an

activity
because
those

are
by

contrary

this
proposed

conflicts
not

with
the

indeed
the

that

instead
of

critical
reasons
first
the
cftc
misreads
the
2010
colloquy
because
the
focus
of
the
discussion
is
on
contracts
that
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
so
it
is
the
economic

this
careful
reading
of
the

is
consistent
with
the
language
of
the
cea
which
states
that
if
a

then
the
cftc
may
prohibit
listing
the
contract
if
it
determines
the
contract
or
group
of

be
contrary
to
the

interest
by
contrast
reading
the
2010
colloquy
to
prohibit
listing
contracts
that
involve
an

activity
would
render
the
2010
colloquy
at
odds
with
the
plain
language
of
the

if

intended
to

all
contracts

it

why

the

should
view

the

does
not

it
hates

the

limiting

or
framework
to
understand
what
it
means
to
be
in

with
a

or

as
a
result
the
public
can
not
provide
meaningful
comment
to
the

regarding
the
scope
of

rather
the

must
look
to

what

furthermore
the

basis
for

is
because

an

much
of

respectfully
requests
that
the

consider
revising

withdrawing

account
for
the
positions
discussed
herein
if
the

chooses
to
revise
rather
than

we
recommend
that

adopt
an
interpretation
of

that
accurately
tracks
the
legislative

of

and

definition
of

and
does
not
broaden
the
scope
of

to
include

paradigm
recommends
that
the
cftc
continue
with
its
established
practice
of
conducting
contract
specific
case
by
case
review
under

and
not
adopt
a
blanket
and
possibly
unlawful
determination
that
all
contracts
involving

are
not

recommends
that
the

propose
the
contemplated

providing
guidance
as
to
the
factors
it
would
consider
when
making
a
determination
that
an
additional
activity
is

activity
for

notice
and

before
