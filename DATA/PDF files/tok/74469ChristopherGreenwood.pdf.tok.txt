ice
respectfully
offers
the
following
comments
on
the
proposed
review
ice
supports
product
innovation
in
the
futures
markets
america
financial
markets
have
thrived
through
innovation
and
regulated
exchanges
develop
new
products
to
meet
market
demand
and
to
allow
market
participants
to
hedge
risks
to
that
end
it
is
crucial
that
the
cftc
establish
a
transparent
accountable
and
consistent
process
for
new
products
so
that
regulated
exchanges
have
certainty
regarding
regulatory
requirements
in
the
case
of
the
kalshiex
contracts
there
appears
to
be
confusion
on
the
application
of
the
cftc
regulations
and
the
standards
implemented
cftc
rule
sets
forth
a
prohibition
on
the
trading
and
clearing
of
any
event
contract
that
involves
relates
to
or
references
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
or
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
an
activity
enumerated
in
of
this
part
and
that
the
commission
determines
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
kalshiex
congressional
control
contract
does
not
appear
to
be
captured
by
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
in
congressional
elections
are
not
terrorism
assassination
war
or
gaming
ice
supports
and
agrees
with
commissioner
pham
dissent
and
analysis
on
this
point
her
dissent
is
available
at
the
commission
should
also
apply
its
rules
uniformly
and
fairly
across
its
contract
markets
ice
notes
the
disparate
treatment
between
the
kalshiex
event
contracts
which
were
put
out
for
a
90
day
review
and
cme
recently
launched
event
contracts
which
were
allowed
to
be
self
certified
because
of
the
different
approach
taken
with
the
cme
questions
regarding
the
advisability
of
a
contract
that
invites
retail
speculation
on
the
settlement
price
of
an
exchange
own
futures
contracts
will
be
left
for
determination
by
the
marketplace
precisely
the
opportunity
that
kalshiex
was
denied
with
respect
to
its
contracts
when
the
commission
incorrectly
invoked
regulation
ice
believes
it
is
imperative
that
the
commission
implement
clear
processes
and
consistently
apply
regulation
ice
understands
the
specific
consideration
given
to
election
contracts
however
the
length
of
time
for
the
cftc
to
decide
on
kalshiex
political
event
contracts
is
concerning
a
prolonged
delay
in
receiving
clarity
on
listing
new
products
is
a
disservice
to
the
regulated
exchange
and
market
participants
in
addition
a
prolonged
delay
impedes
the
exchange
ability
to
be
competitive
in
this
situation
an
extended
review
period
by
the
commission
will
take
kalshiex
beyond
the
event
to
which
the
contract
relates
the
mid
term
elections
the
process
to
list
new
products
including
staff
review
should
be
completed
within
a
timeframe
that
fosters
innovation
and
should
not
delay
new
products
coming
to
market
ice
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposal
ice
shares
the
commission
goals
of
promoting
transparency
accountability
and
predictability
and
facilitating
effective
oversight
ice
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
consider
its
comments
in
light
of
those
goals
