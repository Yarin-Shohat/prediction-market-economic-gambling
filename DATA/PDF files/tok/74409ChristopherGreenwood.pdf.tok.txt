is
grateful
to
the

for
its
consideration
of

the
exchange
welcomes
the
opportunity
to
address
the
commission
questions
this
comment
addresses
the
first
question
and
the
third
question
that
the
commission
asked
1
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
gaming
2
as
described
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
3
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
this
comment
is
divided
into
two
parts
part

cea

the
cea
section
designations
do
not
align
with
the
section
designations
in
the
united
states
code
because
this
is
a
public
comment
the
exchange
will
generally
use
citations
to
the
united
states
code
as
opposed
to
the
cea
which
will
enhance
the
public
ability
to
research
and
analyze
the
issues
presented
at
7
the
exchange
will
address
the
applicability
of
the
regulations
at
17
in
a
separate
comment
and
also
in
the
appendix
to
this
comment
in
the
counsel
analyses
however
the
exchange
notes
here
that
the
regulation
can
not
exceed
the
authority
in
the
statute
that
the
regulation
implements
this
is
axiomatically
true
even
under
the
chevron
deference
from
chevron
natural
resources
defense
council

1984
indeed
step
one
of
chevron
is
to
determine
whether
congress
expressed
intent
in
the
statute
and
if
so
whether
or
not
the
statute
intent
is
ambiguous
it
is
black
letter
law
that
if
the
statute
is
clear
the
regulating
agency
can
not
regulate
contrary
to
the
statute
indeed
earlier
this
year
in
empire
health
justice
kagan
writing
for
the
court
held
that
the
government
regulation
was
valid
only
because
the
regulation
correctly
construes
the
statutory
language
at
issue

had
that
not
been
the
case
justice
kagan
and
the
court
would
have
held
the
regulation
invalid
of
particular
importance
part
1
is
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
statute
irrespective
of
any
rule
including
which
the
commission
has
issued
or
may
in
the
future
promulgate
to
implement
this
statutory
provision
as
a
threshold
matter
the
exchange
notes
that
the
majority
of
the
commission
questions
for

comment
assume
that
the

in

question
that
the

questions

and

if
the
answers
to
questions
1
and

are
no
many
of
the
other

become
moot
at

in

to
the

the

matter
under
consideration
in
this

specifically
if
the

there
are
several

that
are

to

are

a

a

a
broad
view
of
a
contract
and
all
factors
that
surround
or
are
a
part
of
the
contract
for
example
this
would
include
the
activity
of
buying
and
selling
the

ie
the
activity
of

the

embedded
in

and
in

of
an

the

accordingly
any
suggestion
that
the
commission
regulation
which
implements
the
statute
at
7
applies
to
a
contract
to
which
the
statute
itself
does
not
apply
is
specious
if
the
regulation
did
it
would
be
invalid
regardless
a
careful
reading
of
the
regulation
shows
that
the
regulation
does
not
apply
to
any
contract
to
which
the
statute
does
not
apply
we
address
the
regulation
in
more
depth

the
statute

of

focuses
on
the
correct
interpretation
of

is
set
forth
in

general
background
on
the
cea
special
rule
under
the
cea
contract
listing
is
not
a
permission
regime
contracts
do
not
need
commission
approval
to
be
listed
and
although
the
cea
provides
a
mechanism
that
exchanges
may
utilize
to
put
a
contract
before
the
commission
for
approval
whether
or
not
to
utilize
that
method
is
solely
in
an
exchange
discretion
this
process
is
set
forth
in
17
which
the
commission
titled
voluntary
submission
of
new
products
for
commission
review
and
approval
indeed
the
overwhelmingly
vast
majority
of
contracts
are
never
presented
to
the
commission
for
approval
under
this
mechanism
even
in
those
rare
instances
when
the
commission
is
formally
presented
with
a
contract
for
approval
the
commission
discretion
over
whether
to
grant
or
withhold
approval
is
limited
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations
the
commission
must
approve
every
contract
that
does
not
violate
the
cea
or
the
regulations

17
the
commission
was
not
granted
authority
to
conduct
a
is
this
a
contract
that
i
am
comfortable
with
analysis
and
the
commission
was
not
granted
authority
to
disapprove
a
contract
because
it
does
not
like
it
the
commission
was
also
not
granted
the
authority
to
prohibit
any
contract
on
the
grounds
that
it
violates
the
public
interest
there
is
one
exception
to
this
rule
where
congress
did
give
the
commission
the
authority
to
prohibit
a
contract
that
the
commission
determines
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as
explained
below
and
in
a
second
comment
letter
even
if
argunedo
the
special
rule
applied
to
the
contract
which
it
does
not
the
special
rule
would
still
not
prohibit
the
contract
because
it
is
in
the
public
interest
and
therefore
certainly
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
exception
is
the
special
rule
in
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
7
this
special
rule
gives
the
commission
discretion
to
consider
for
very
specific
types
of
contracts
whether
a
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
special
rule
the
first
is
the
special
rule
eligibility
requirements
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
all
contracts
it
only
applies
to
a
specifically
defined
subset
of
contracts
identified
through
a
two
step
process
described
below
that
are
eligible
for
the
special
rule
if
a
contract
is
determined
to
be
eligible
for
the
special
rule
it
is
not
automatically
prohibited
the
special
rule
only
prohibits
contracts
that
are
eligible
for
the
special
rule
al
rule
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
second
aspect
of
the
special
rule
thus
is
determining
whether
the
contract
that
is
eligible
for
the
special
rule
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
congress
laid
out
the
process
for
the
special
rule
in
three
steps
the
three
steps
of
the
special
rule
there
are
three
steps
in
the
special
rule
step
one
of
the
special
rule
step
one
is
to
determine
if
the
contract
is
eligible
for
the
special
rule
the
statute
limits
the
scope
of
the
special
rule
to
contracts
that
are
based
upon
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
collectively
event
in
other
words
to
be
eligible
for
the
special
rule
a
contract
must
be
based
on
an
event
the
contract
must
be
an
event
contract
if
a
contract
is
not
an
event
contract
it
is
not
eligible
for
the
special
rule
and
the
contract
fails
step
one
the
analysis
then
terminates
and
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
that
contract
if
the
contract
is
an
event
contract
the
analysis
proceeds
to
step
two
step
two
of
the
special
rule
step
two
is
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
please
see
infra
the
a
further
look
at
step
two
of
the
special
rule
for
more
discussion
on
the
correct
interpretation
of
step
two
and
why
step
two
is
limited
to
the
contract
event
certain
activities
that
were
listed
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
these
activities
are
1
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
2
terrorism
3
assassination
4
war
5
gaming
in
addition
to
these
five
specific
activities
congress
included
a
sixth
activity
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
7
this
sixth
activity
gives
the
commission
discretion
to
identify
other
similar
activities
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
event
contract
event
does
not
involve
any
of
the
six
activities
that
are
listed
in
the
special
rule
the
event
contract
is
not
eligible
for
the
special
rule
the
analysis
terminates
and
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
prohibit
the
contract
if
the
event
contract
event
does
involve
at
least
one
of
these
activities
the
analysis
continues
to
step
three
step
three
of
the
special
rule
step
three
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
the
contract
itself
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
phrase
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
used
three
times
in
the
special
rule
it
is
used
in
clause
i
in
reference
to
the
sixth
activity
in
the
list
of
activities
congress
included
in
step
two
of
the
special
rule
in
this
context
it
is
the
contract
event
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
not
the
contract
itself
it
is
also
used
in
clause
i
in
step
three
and
in
the
prohibition
in
clause
ii
in
reference
to
the
contract
itself
if
the
commission
does
not
determine
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
contract
is
not
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
if
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
special
rule
applies
and
the
contract
is
prohibited
7
no
agreement
contract
or
transaction
determined
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
clause
i
may
be
listed
or
made
available
for
clearing
or
trading
on
or
through
a
registered
entity
the
three
steps
that
the
commission
follows
in
applying
the
special
rule
are
therefore
step
1
is
the
contract
an
event
contract
if
no
stop
if
yes
continue
to
step
2
step
2
does
the
event
contract
event
involve
an
activity
that
was
included
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
if
no
stop
if
yes
continue
to
step
3
step
3
is
the
contract
itself
considered
as
a
whole
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
no
the
contract
is
not
prohibited
if
yes
the
contract
is
prohibited
graphically
the
flow
of
the
three
steps
looks
like
this
step
one
and
step
two
limit
the
scope
of
contracts
to
which
the
special
rule
applies
step
one
limits
the
special
rule
only
to
event
contracts
step
two
limits
this
scope
further
step
two
provides
that
the
special
rule
does
not
apply
to
all
event
contracts
but
only
to
those
contracts
whose
events
involve
one
of
the
activities
congress
listed
in
the
statute
step
three
provides
that
even
a
contract
that
passes
steps
one
and
two
is
not
prohibited
unless
the
commission
determines
that
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
following
graphic
illustrates
how
each
step
of
the
special
rule
functions
to
narrow
the
scope
of
the
contracts
that
are
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
all
contracts
step
1
is
the
contract
anevent
contract
does
the
event
contract
event
involve
an
activity
that
was
included
by
step
2
congress
in
the
special
rule
step3
is
the
contract
itself
considered
as
a
whole
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
further
explain
the
role
of
step
three
congress
did
not
prohibit
an
event
contract
whose
event
involves
an
activity
listed
in
the
special
rule
it
is
possible
that
an
event
contract
event
involves
an
activity
listed
in
the
special
rule
but
the
commission
does
not
determine
that
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
contract
would
not
be
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
for
example
an
event
contract
on
the
invasion
of
ukraine
would
satisfy
steps
one
and
two
because
it
is
an
event
contract
step
one
and
the
event
contract
event
involves
war
one
of
the
activities
that
is
listed
in
the
special
rule
step
two
that
does
not
mean
that
the
contract
is
prohibited
it
moves
to
step
three
for
the
commission
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
may
determine
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
which
case
the
event
contract
would
be
prohibited
by
the
special
rule
7
and
the
commission
may
determine
that
it
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
as

accordingly
the
commission
may
find
that
the
event
contract
has
hedging
utility
other
economic
utility
or
benefits
and
thus
could
not
determine
that
the
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
point
that
a
contract
event
can
involve
an
activity
listed
in
the
statute
and
still
be
allowed
because
the
contract
itself
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
was
made
by
then
commissioner
berkovitz
in
his
statement
on
erisx
rsbix
contracts
commissioner
berkovitz
statement
is
available
here
commissioner
berkovitz
concluded
his
statement
by
noting
that
if
sporting
event
contracts
with
an
economic
purpose
such
as
hedging
are
allowed
to
be
traded
on
a
dcm
the
general
public
must
be
able
to
access
and
trade
those
contracts
on
the
exchange
the
public
can
not
be
barred
from
trading
a
contract
listed
on
a
dcm
however
gaming
contracts
without
any
economic
purpose
should
not
be
permitted
on
a
dcm
a
further
look
at
step
two
of
the
special
rule
once
an
event
contract
passes
step
one
the
analysis
moves
to
step
two
of
the
special
rule
step
two
is
to
determine
if
the
event
contract
involves
an
activity
that
was
listed
by
congress
in
the
special
rule
for
the
purposes
of
step
two
of
the
special
rule
an
event
contract
only
involves
an
activity
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
that
activity
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
in
step
three
is
different
from
step
two
the
analysis
in
step
three
considers
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
and
is
not
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
conversely
the
analysis
in
step
two
is
limited
to
what
activities
the
event
contract
event
involves
for
example
an
event
contract
can
only
involve
war
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
war
conversely
if
the
event
contract
event
does
not
involve
war
then
the
event
contract
does
not
involve
war
similarly
an
event
contract
will
involve
gaming
only
if
the
event
contract
event
involves
gaming
for
the
purposes
of
step
two
it
is
irrelevant
if
something
else
surrounding
the
event
contract
such
as
the
market
activity
of
trading
the
contract
involves
a
listed
activity
the
only
relevant
factor
for
step
two
is
whether
the
event
contract
event
involves
the
listed
activity
not
whether
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
involves
the
listed
activity
there
are
many
reasons
why
the
analysis
of
whether
an
event
contract
involves
a
listed
activity
in
step
two
is
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
and
does
not
include
the
consideration
of
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
many
of
these
reasons
are
stated
in
the
letters
in
part
2
of
this
comment
as
well
as
by
other

the
exchange
provides
two
reasons
here
for
convenience
this
comment
refers
to
the
incorrect
reading
that
the
analysis
under
step
two
includes
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
and
is
not
limited
to
only
the
event
contract
event
as
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
wrong
an
event
contract
can
not
be
considered
to
involve
a
listed
activity
based
on
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
and
not
only
the
event
contract
event
if
step
two
were
so
broad
it
would
1
defeat
congress
intended
narrowing
function
and
2
render
the
statute
internally
inconsistent
the
sixth
activity
illustrates
the
flaw
in
applying
step
two
broadly
ie
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
congress
included
as
the
sixth
activity
a
similar
activity
to
the
first
five
activities
that
is
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
the
sixth
activity
means
that
the
commission
can
determine
that
any
factor
that
is
part
of
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
is
because
under
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
step
two
is
not
limited
only
to
looking
at
the
event
contract
event
the
analysis
in
step
two
looks
at
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
accordingly
the
activities
included
in
the
list
in
step
two
are
not
confined
to
the
event
contracts
events
and
can
include
anything
related
to
the
event
contract
for
example
the
commission
can
determine
that
trading
contracts
on
a
certain
event
is
a
similar
activity
to
the
listed
activities
and
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
these
contracts
would
satisfy
step
two
even
though
the
event
contracts
are
based
on
events
that
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
the
trading
on
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
per
the
commission
determination
and
trading
on
the
contract
is
part
of
the
contract
when
considered
as
a
whole
the
analysis
would
then
move
to
step
three
but
step
three
calls
for
a
public
interest
analysis
of
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
where
it
has
already
been
determined
under
step
two
that
the
trading
itself
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
that
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
this
results
in
two
consecutive
steps
that
do
the
exact
same
thing
step
two
the
commission
determines
that
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
step
three
the
commission
determines
that
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
again
this
illustrates
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
what
congress
clearly
designed
is
a
statute
that
allows
the
commission
to
apply
special
scrutiny
to
contracts
based
on
particular
events
that
congress
identified
as
problematic
congress
did
not
shut
the
door
to
such
contracts
but
recognized
that
trading
on
an
event
contract
whose
event
is
a
problematic
activity
that
involves
say
assassination
or
terrorism
might
neverthless
have
redeeming
features
such
as
hedging
utility
that
would
justify
the
conclusion
that
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
this
way
congress
clearly
differentiated
the
event
contract
event
which
may
be
disfavored
and
trading
in
the
event
contract
permitted
where
trading
on
the
disfavored
activity
offers
economic
and
other
societal
benefits
when
trading
in
the
event
contract
itself
is
included
in
the
analysis
at
step
two
the
distinction
congress
sought
to
draw
between
the
underlying
event
and
trading
in
the
contract
is
obliterated
this
defect
in
the
statute
that
emerges
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
from
the
sixth
activity
the
fact
that
the
defect
stems
from
the
sixth
activity
does
not
mean
that
defect
is
limited
to
the
sixth
activity
and
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
fine
with
regard
to
activities
one
through
five
that
would
misapprehend
the
way
that
statutes
work
once
it
is
demonstrated
that
step
two
can
not
be
about
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
for
even
one
activity
that
view
is
proven
wrong
therefore
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
an
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
regardless
of
the
activity
additionally
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
actually
renders
all
of
the
first
five
activities
in
step
two
superfluous
once
a
contract
passes
step
two
no
matter
which
activity
the
contract
involves
it
must
pass
step
three
to
be
prohibited
by
the
special
rule
the
analysis
in
step
three
is
for
the
commission
to
determine
whether
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
any
event
contract
that
the
commission
determines
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
step
three
necessarily
would
also
satisfy
the
sixth
activity
in
step
two
for
example
an
event
contract
that
involves
war
will
pass
step
two
the
analysis
of
the
event
contract
will
then
move
to
step
three
and
assume
that
the
commission
finds
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
at
that
point
the
event
contract
actually
involves
two
of
the
listed
activities
i
it
involves
the
activity
of
war
and
ii
it
also
involves
an
activity
that
the
commission
has
determined
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
it
is
impossible
for
an
event
contract
to
pass
step
three
and
not
involve
the
sixth
activity
in
step
two
accordingly
there
is
no
point
in
the
first
five
activities
listed
in
step
two
only
the
sixth
activity
in
fact
there
would
be
no
point
in
step
two
at
all
as
noted
the
sixth
activity
in
step
two
and
step
three
are
identical
accordingly
if
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
correct
congress
would
have
just
skipped
step
two
altogether
the
special
rule
would
have
been
a
simple
six
line
statute
that
said
only
in
connection
with
the
listing
of
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
other
than
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
levels
of
a
commodity
described
in
section
of
this
title
by
a
designated
contract
market
or
swap
execution
facility
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
inevitable
collapse
of
all
of
the
step
two
activities
into
the
sixth
activity
and
the
collapse
of
the
sixth
activity
into
step
three
under
this
expansive
interpretation
of
step
two
shows
that
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
is
wrong
the
correct
view
of
step
two
is
that
it
like
step
one
simply
describes
what
the
contract
is
based
on
and
the
analysis
in
step
two
is
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
accordingly
there
is
a
big
difference
between
step
two
including
the
sixth
activity
and
step
three
step
two
is
focused
only
on
the
event
contract
event
if
an
event
contract
passes
step
two
because
the
event
contract
event
involves
any
of
the
listed
activities
even
the
sixth
activity
the
analysis
under
step
two
will
always
be
different
from
the
analysis
under
step
three
the
analysis
under
step
two
will
be
whether
the
event
contract
event
involves
the
activity
the
analysis
under
step
three
is
very
different
step
three
does
not
only
consider
the
event
contract
event
alone
it
considers
the
event
contract
considered
as
a
whole
thus
all
of
the
anomalies
that
directly
stem
from
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
disappear
under
the
view
that
the
analysis
in
step
two
like
step
one
considers
only
the
event
contract
event
the
correct
reading
of
the
statute
is
that
the
analysis
in
step
two
like
step
one
is
limited
to
the
event
contract
event
steps
one
and
two
work
in
concert
to
create
the
eligibility
requirements
for
the
type
of
contract
that
the
special
rule
applies
to
an
event
contract
whose
event
involves
a
listed
activity
and
step
three
serves
as
an
independent
step
whose
analysis
considers
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
together
all
three
steps
form
a
coherent
and
cohesive
statutory
rule
that
implements
congress
intent
to
have
the
commission
review
a
narrow
subset
of

whose
underlying
events

such
as

and
assasination
congress
did
not
want
to
automatically
legitimize
via
futures
and
swaps
trading
on
them
congress
nevertheless
gave
the
commission
discretion
to
allow
such
contracts
to
be
listed
if
trading
them
would
not
be

the
commission
applied
the
special
rule
to
contracts
on
the
occurrences
of
political
control
and
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
these
occurrences
do
not
involve
any
of
the
activities
in
step
two
of
the
special
rule
despite
this
the
nadex
order
concluded
that
the
special
rule
applied
and
prohibited
the
contracts
the
nadex
order
adopted
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
and
assumed
that
the
analysis
in
step
two
considers
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
not
just
the
event
contract
event
the
nadex
order
found
that
the
election
contracts
involved
the
activity
of
gaming
even
though
the
contract
event
did
not
because
the
act
of
trading
on
the
contract
was
gaming
and
therefore
those
contracts
considered
as
a
whole
satisfied
step
two
this
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
that
the
nadex
order
adopted
is
wrong
and
should
be
rejected
as
discussed
at
length
it
violates
the
structure
and
the
framework
of
the
statute
and
it
leads
to
absurd
results
the
correct
view
of
the
statute
is
that
step
two
like
step
one
relates
to
what
the
contract
is
based
on
or
the
contract
event
the
nadex
order
misreading
of
the
statute
would
apply
to
every
futures
and
swap
contract
on
an
occurrence
the
consequence
of
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
that
the
nadex
order
adopted
is
that
the
special
rule
applies
to
all
futures
commodity
options
and
swap
contracts
that
are
based
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
the
nadex
order
found
that
the
contracts
at
issue
there
were
gaming
because
the
act
of
trading
the
contracts
would
fit
within
state
law
and
federal
law
definitions
of
gaming
that
same
reasoning
would
apply
to
all
futures
commodity
options
and
swaps
that
are
based
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
because
the
act
of
trading
these
contracts
would
also
fit
within
definitions
of
gaming
for
example
the
nadex
order
cited
the
law
in
north
dakota
that
gambling
means
risking
any
money
upon
the
happening
or
outcome
of
an
event
including
an
election
over
which
the
person
taking
the
risk
has
no
control
nadex
order
fn
1
the
nadex
order
also
cited
the
new
hampshire
law
that
wager
means
a
monetary
agreement
between
2
or
more
persons
that
a
sum
of
money
shall
be
paid
to
one
of
them
on
the
happening
or
not
happening
of
an
uncertain
event
it
is
true
that
the
nadex
order
also
cited
state
laws
that
were
more
tailored
to
elections
specifically
but
that
does
not
negate
the
point
that
there
are
also
state
laws
that
define
gaming
broadly
that
would
include
trading
any
futures
commodity
options
or
swap
contracts
that
pass
step
one
picking
and
choosing
which
state
statutes
to
consider
informative
in
a
manner
that
is
expedient
for
a
desired
outcome
is
not
the
proper
way
for
the
commission
to
adopt
its
definitional
framework
the
approach
the
commission
adopted
in
the
nadex
order
expands
the
scope
of
the
special
rule
far
beyond
what
congress
intended
under
the
nadex
order
and
in
light
of
the
breadth
of
some
definitions
of
gaming
activity
the
commission
could
deem
the
staking
of
value
on
any
type
of
future
event
gaming
alternatively
the
commission
could
determine
via
the
authority
granted
in
the
sixth
activity
that
trading
on
any
type
of
future
event
is
similar
to
the
other
enumerated
activities
the
vast
breadth
of
such
discretion
can
not
be
squared
with
the
specific
enumeration
of
activities
which
congress
clearly
designed
to
cabin
the
special
rule
scope
this
reality
illustrates
the
nadex
order
flaw
in
going
beyond
the
event
underlying
the
contract
elections
to
determine
whether
the
contract
was
gaming
this
argument
is
addressed
in
greater
detail
in
part
2
of
this
comment
however
the
exchange
notes
here
that
this
overbreadth
is
a
problem
exclusive
to
the
approach
to
the
contract
as
a
whole
view
of
step
two
adopted
in
the
nadex
order
under
the
more
tailored
approach
where
step
two
of
the
special
rule
is
limited
to
the
contract
event
this
overbreadth
disappears
applying
the
three
steps
of
the
special
rule
to
kalshi

applying
the
three
steps
to
kalshi

that
the
contract
is
not
subject
to
the
special
rule
kalshi

one
it
is

proceeds
to
step
two
step
two
is
whether
the
event
contract
event
involves
an
activity
that
was
listed
in
step
two
the
contract
event
is
political
control
specifically
the
dual
occurrences
of
the
party
membership
of
the
speaker
of
the
house
and
the
president
pro
tempore
these
do
not
involve
any
of
the
listed
activities
the
occurrence
of
political
control
does
not
involve
activity
that
is
illegal
under
either
federal
or
state
law
the
occurrence
of
political
control
does
not
involve
the
activity
of
terrorism
the
occurrence
of
political
control
does
not
involve
the
activity
of
assassinations
the
occurrence
of
political
control
does
not
involve
the
activity
of
war
the
occurrence
of
political
control
does
not
involve
the
activity
of
gaming
the
commission
has
never
stated
or
even
implied
that
the
occurrence
of
elections
involves
gaming
in
the
commission
nadex
order
the
commission
stated
that
taking
a
position
in
a
political
event
contract
is
gaming
because
elections
are
a
a
contest
between
electoral
candidates

however
the
commission
was
careful
to
not
suggest
that
elections
themselves
the
very
bedrock
and
foundation
of
our
democracy
are
a
game
the
occurrence
of
political
control
does
not
involve
an
activity
that
the
commission
has
determined
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
contract
event
therefore
does
not
involve
an
activity
that
was
included
by
congress
in
the
list
of
activities
in
step
two
of
the
special
rule
and
therefore
the
contract
fails
the
step
two
eligibility
requirements
the
analysis
therefore
terminates
and
does
not
proceed
to
step
three
and
congress
did
not
authorize
the
commission
to
apply
the
special
rule
to
prohibit
the
contract
conclusion
to
part
1
congress
granted
the
commission
in
the
special
rule
the
authority
to
prohibit
certain
contracts
this
grant
of
authority
is
subject
to
the
rules
that
congress
created
congress
included
three
distinct
steps
to
determine
if
a
contract
is
prohibited
under
the
special
rule
the
commission
must
abide
by
these
rules
step
two
is
clear
the
analysis
only
considers
whether
the
event
contract
event
involves
a
listed
activity
and
it
does
not
consider
the
event
contract
as
a
whole
the
kalshi
contract
event
is
political
control
political
control
does
not
involve
any
of
the
activities
that
congress
included
in
step
two
accordingly
the
contract
fails
step
two
and
the
special
rule
can
not
prohibit
the
contract
as
required
by
the
cea
in
7
the
commission
should
approve
the
contract

the
many
reasons

the
spirit
of
building
upon

in

of

of

we
wanted
to
elaborate
on
why
section
of
the

act

and
cftc

together
the

provisions
do
not
provide
a
legal
basis
for
the

or
the
commission
to
impede
self
certification
of
the
contracts
as
further
explained
below
section
of
the
cea
does
not
hinder
self
certification
of
the
contracts
because
the
activity
on
which
they
are
based
does
not
involve
any
of
the
enumerated
event
categories
in
the
provision
although
the
commission
previously
determined
that
other
political
event
contracts
that
were
self
certified
by
a
different
exchange
the
north
american
derivatives

nadex
were
subject
to
the
event
contracts
provisions
that
determination
was
based
on
a
misinterpretation
of
the

provisions
therefore
the
commission
previous
determination
on
nadex
proposed
contracts
should
not
be
followed
here
with

to
the

political

contracts
nadex
order
which
determined
that
the
trading
of
contracts
based
on
the
outcomes
of

constituted
gaming
activity
the
commission
must
consider
whether
the
occurrence
or
contingency
on
which
the
contracts
are
based
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
because
elections
do
not
fit
within
any
of
the
enumerated
event
categories
the
event
contracts
provisions
provide
no
basis
to
delay
selfcertification
cftc

calls
for
the
same
result
accordingly
even
if
arguendo
cftc
regulation
contains
language
that
could
be
construed
to
support
a
different
result
the
commission
should
read
cftc
regulation
to
be
consistent
with
section
and
accordingly
the
contracts
should
be
self
certified
without
delay
or
encumbrance
as
explained
in
greater
detail
below
because
the
event
contracts
provisions
do
not
establish
any
legal
or
regulatory
basis
for
impeding
the
contracts
the
commission
should
take
no

that
would
delay

certifying
them
pursuant
to

section
of

thus
the
cea
through
this
provision
establishes
a
clear
framework
under
which
the

can
but
is
not
obligated
to
review
an

that
is
based
upon
an

extent
of
an

be

a
commission
determination
that
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
would
render
its
listing
prohibited
in
short
through
section
congress
granted
the
commission
the
discretion
to
determine
that
a
given
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
thereby
prohibited
only
when
the
event
underlying
that
contract
involves
one
of
the
statute
specifically
enumerated
activities
congress
did
not
grant
the
commission
the
authority
to
prohibit
a
contract
based
upon
an
event
that
involves
an
unenumerated
activity
on
the
grounds
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the

this

sixth
enumerated
activity
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the

that

requires
the

to
conduct
a
rulemaking
to
determine
that
another

and
then
only

explained
available
at
the
plain
language
and
structure
of

make
clear
that
the
scope
of
the
commission
discretionary
review
is
narrowly
focused
on
the
nature
of
the
contract
underlying
event
not
of
trading
in

itself

in

that
are
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
emphasis
added
thus
at
the
outset
of
the
controlling
provision
the
statute
establishes
that
the
distinguishing
feature
of
the
contract
is
the
nature
of
the
occurrence
or
contingency
the
final
clause
of
section
immediately
prior
to
the
provision
enumeration
of
the
covered
activities
refers
back
to
the
first
clause
of
the
provision
when
it
says
the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
involve
the
enumerated
activities
emphasis
added
when
the
clauses
are
read
together
section
grants
the
commission
only
limited
authority
to
review
a
contract
that
is
based
upon
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
that
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
plain
language
of
the
enumerated
events
themselves
bolsters
this
interpretation
as
kalshi
has
pointed
out

section
first
and
sixth
categories
are
defined
respectively
as
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
and
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
emphasis
added
the
inclusion
of
the
noun
activity
and
the
reference
in
the
sixth
category
to
all
five
preceding
similar
makes
clear
that
congress
intended
the
underlying
activity
not
the
contract
itself
to
be
the
subject
of
review
and
scrutiny
and
it
must
be
assumed
that
decision
was
intentional
the
scant
legislative
history
a
colloquy
between
senators
diane
feinstein
and
blanche
lincoln
during
the
senate
consideration
of
dodd
frank
regulation
of
event
contracts
does
not
change
the
analysis
the
colloquy
did
not
address
whether
the
underlying
event
rather
than
trading
in
the
contract
itself
is
the
proper
subject
of
analysis
instead
the
senators
discussed
the
distinction
in
economic
purpose
between
contracts
that
serve
hedging
utility
and
contracts
that
are
designed
predominantly
for
speculation

statements
of
diane
feinstein
and
blanche
lincoln
available
at
in
any
event
the
language
and
structure
of
the
statute
are
clear
so
resorting
to
legislative
history
is
unnecessary
the
sixth
enumerated
activity
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
commission
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
further
highlights
that
congress
intention
was
for
the
commission
to
analyze
the
activity
underlying
the
contract
rather
than
trading
in
the
contract
itself
this
final
enumerated
activity
provides
the
commission
a
sort
of
catchall
to
determine
whether
the
event
involves
similar
activity
to
the
preceding
categories
and
thus
might
be
inappropriate
for
listing
since
terrorism
assassination
war
and
activity
unlawful
under
state
or
federal
law
unquestionably
refer
to
the
occurrence
or
contingency
underlying
the
contract
the
sixth
catch
all
category
must
be
read
consistently
with
the
rest
of
the
enumerated
list
apples
must
be
compared
to
apples
we
explain
below
why
notwithstanding
the
commission
nadex
order
the
gaming
provision
must
also
refer
to
the
underlying
activity
and
not
trading
in
the
contract
itself
another
reason
that
section
must
be
read
as
focusing
on
the
underlying
activity
is
that
such
focus
is
congruent
with
the
nature
of
event
contracts
themselves
if
congress
was
concerned
about
trading
in
the
contract
itself
there
is
no
indication
why
it
would
have
limited
the
provision
to
event
contracts
rather
than
establishing
a
general
rule
that
would
have
authorized
the
commission
to
prohibit
any
derivatives
contract
that
the
trading
in
is
for
example
unlawful
under
state
law
in
the
nadex
order
see
supra
note
1
the
commission
did
not
interpret
section
as
focusing
on
the
underlying
activity
instead
the
commission
appears
to
have
read
the
gaming
provision
the
fifth
enumerated
activity
to
refer
to
trading
in
the
contract
itself
accordingly
the
commission
determined
that
the
gaming
provision
applied
to
nadex
political
event
contracts
because
the
contracts
involved
a
person
staking
something
of
value
upon
a
contest
of
others
nadex
order
at
3
internal
quotation
marks
omitted
the
commission
likened
this
trading
activity
to
activity
prohibited
by
state
anti
gambling
laws
the
commission
interpretation
in
this
instance
ran
counter
to
the
plain
language
and
structure
of
the
statute
as
explained
above
other
principles
of
statutory
construction
also
undercut
the
application
of
the
event
contracts
provisions
in
the
nadex
order
under
the
commission
interpretation
a
person
trading
a
political
event
contract
is
engaged
in
gaming
staking
something
of
value
upon
a
contest
of
others
by
parallel
reasoning
a
person
trading
a
terrorism
contract
is
engaged
in
terrorism
and
a
person
trading
a
war
contract
is
engaged
in
war
that
is
not
a
tenable
interpretation
of
the
statute
if
congress
intended
the
commission
to
focus
on
the
underlying
event
for
some
of
the
enumerated
categories
but
to
focus
on
trading
in
the
contract
itself
for
others
it
would
have
said
so
it
certainly
can
not
be
presumed
or
inferred
from
silence
that
congress
intended
the
commission
to
apply
disparate
analytical
approaches
to
the
single
list
of
enumerated
activities
when
the
correct
interpretation
of
section
is
applied
to
the
contracts
the
result
is
clear
elections
are
not
illegal
under
state
or
federal
law
are
not
gaming
and
are
not
similar
to
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
federal
or
state
crimes
terrorism
assassination
war
and
gaming
all
of
which
are
activities
that
congress
did
not
want
to
legitimize
or
encourage
via
event
contracts
without
careful
consideration
by
the
commission
the
commission
should
therefore
not
impede
kalshi
from
self
certifying
the
contracts
and
lacks
a
legal
basis
to
invoke
section
to
do
so
while
we
could
stop
here
we
believe
it
is
worth
pointing
out
that
the
nadex
order
not
only
contravenes
the
language
and
structure
of
section
but
also
threatens
to
upend
the
cea
itself
virtually
every
futures
or
swaps
contract
can
be
described
as
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
some
future
event
this
overly
broad
interpretation
of
the
term
gaming
would
threaten
to
render
other
enumerated
provisions
superfluous
given
that
as
explained
above
virtually
all
event
contracts
could
potentially
qualify
for
that
categorization
as
the
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
observed
there
is
a
canon
against
interpreting
any
statutory
provision
in
a
manner
that
would
render
another
provision
superfluous

yet
the
cftc
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
derivatives
markets
means
that
the
cea
preempts
any
state
law
that
would
attempt
to
regulate

holding
that
when
application
of
state
law
would
directly
affect
trading
on
or
the
operation
of
a
futures
market
it
would
stand
as
an
obstacle
to
the
accomplishment
and
execution
of
the
full
purposes
and
objectives
of
congress
and
hence
is
preempted
quoting

therefore
regulated
futures
and
swaps
contracts
can
not
be
illegal
gambling
under
state
law
in
fact
many
states
ban
gambling
not
just
on
elections
but
more
generally
on
the
outcomes
of
future
events
these
laws
would
prohibit
the
entire
category
of
event
contracts
at
a
minimum
which
both
congress
and
the
cftc
have
expressly
permitted
to
be
listed
on
dcms
some
of
these
states
provide
carve
outs
for
cftc

or
otherwise
for

however

it

but

all
of
these
various
provisions
illustrate
the
flaw
in
evaluating
whether
trading
a
futures
or

contract
constitutes
gaming
or
gambling
activity
as
the
commission
did
in
the
nadex
order
or
whether
trading
a
futures
or
swaps
contract
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
instead
to
maintain
the
structural
integrity
of
section
and
the
cea
itself
the
commission
should
evaluate
whether
the
contracts
involve
an
underlying
activity
elections
that
fits
into
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
of
activities
in
section
because
elections
do
not
fit
within
any
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
commission
should
not
impede
self
certification
of
the
contracts
ii
cftc
regulation
calls
for
the
same
result
a
determination
that
section
does
not
present
an
obstacle
to
kalshi
self
certification
of
the
contracts
should
be
dispositive
because
cftc
regulation
which
the
cftc
adopted
to
implement
section
should
likewise
be
read
to
allow
only
for
the
commission
consideration
of
the
contract
underlying
activity
rather
than
its
consideration
of
trading
in
the
contract
itself
while
the
language
of
the
rule
is
not
identical
to
the
statute
there
is
no
reason
to
read
the
language
of
cftc
regulation
to
require
an
analysis
of
trading
in
the
contract
rather
than
the
contract
underlying
activity
that
constitutes
the
event
the
scope
of
cftc
regulation
should
not
be
read
to
go
beyond
the
scope
of
the
special
rule
in
the
statute
by
using
the
words
relates
to
or
references
in
addition
to
involves
the
regulation
only
reinforces
that
the
relevant
activity
is
the
underlying
event
not
trading
on
the
underlying
event
it
would
not
make
sense
for
a
futures
contract
or
swap
to
reference
trading
in
the
contract
to
the
contrary
the
word
reference
is
a
clear
direction
to
focus
on
the
underlying
event
that
the
contract
references
thus
under
the
regulation
like
the
statute
the
relevant
activity
for
purposes
of
the
commission
event
contract
analysis
is
the
activity
on
which
the
contract
is
based
or
to
which
the
contract
refers
rather
than
the
contract
itself
because
the
contracts
are
not
based
on
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
does
not
need
to
consider
undertaking
a
public
interest
analysis
if
the
commission
were
to
conclude
otherwise
however
the
commission
could
either
permit
the
contracts
to
be
listed
the
statute
authorizes
prohibition
only
upon
a
commission
determination
that
the
contract
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
determination
that
the
commission
may
undertake
or
conduct
a
public
interest
analysis
cftc
regulation
should
not
be
read
to
constitute
a
blanket
prohibition
as
that
reading
could
not
be
squared
with
the
statute

the

must
resort
to

at

including
a
careful
consideration
of
the
text
structure
history
and
purpose
of

at

to
determine
whether
a
rule
has

or
can
at

establish
the
outer
bounds
of
reasonable
interpretation
at

the
kisor
court
goes
on
to
explain
that
an
agency
interpretation
of
an
ambiguous
regulation
may
still
not
receive
deference
the
court
must
then
determine
if
the
character
and
context
of
the
agency
interpretation
entitles
it
to
controlling
weight
in
discussing
this
approach
to
regulatory

the

relied
heavily
on
the

application
to

to
help
frame
the
matter
the
key
question
here
requires
understanding
the
limitations
on
the
scope
of

rule
is
the
scope

limited
to

when
the

do

include
the
act
of

is
itself
applying
the
principles
of

and
regulatory
construction
shows
that
section
and
rule
are
limited
to
only
the
underlying
activity
not
participating
in
the

itself
and
because
kalshi

not

any
of

which
the

is
expressly
limited
to
those
contracts

implementing

section
and
rule
apply
only
to
event
contracts
where
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
plain
text
of
section
demonstrates
that
congress
limited
the
statute
scope
to
instances
where
the
underlying
activity
of
an
event
contract
is
one
of
the
enumerated
events
if
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
does
not
involve
one
of
the

activities
the
listing
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute
and
rule
regardless
of
how
the
act
of
participating
in
the
event
contract
itself
is
classified
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
extends
the
applicable
scope
to
also
include
contracts
where
the
underlying
activity
is
not
one
of
the

events
is
overbroad

incorrect
first

at

the

added
these

are
not
the
contracts
themselves
they
are
the

that
create
the
basis
for
the
relevant
contract
to
give
but
one
straightforward
example
in
the
statute
events
two
through
four
are
terrorism
assassination
and
war
the
inclusion
of
these
activities
clearly
demonstrates
that
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
includes
contracts
when
the
activity
underlying
the
event
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
act
of
participating
in
a
contract
is
not
itself
an
act
of
terrorism
assassination
or
war
to
illustrate
this
point
consider
hypothetical
contracts
on
whether
a
foreign
leader
will
be
assassinated
how
many
russian
planes
will
be
shot
down
by
ukrainian
forces
or
how
many
murders
will
occur
in
a
given
city
over
a
certain
time
period
section
and
rule
would
apply
to
these
hypothetical
contracts
because
the
activities
underlying
the
contracts
in
these
hypothetical
examples
are
the
enumerated
activities
of
assassination
war
and
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
the
purchasing
of
the
contract
itself
however
is
not
an
activity
of
assassination
war
or
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
the
same
analytical
approach
by
extension
should
apply
to
each
of
the
items
on
the
list
including
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal

additional
key
limitation
on

contracts

within

of

those

that
are

upon
the

extent
of
an

the
reference
to
occurrence
or
contingency
can
only
mean
to
the
underlying
event
of
the
contract
not
the
contract
itself
the
contract
can
not
reasonably
be
described
as
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
indeed
the
headings
of
the

for

and

of

and
swap
contracts
section
and
event
contracts
section
congress
focus
on
the
event
or
occurrence
not
the
trading
of
the
contract
thus
the
text
and
structure
of
section
clearly
and
meaningful
limit
the

reach
regarding
event
contracts
because
the
text
and
structure
is

there
is
no
need
to
resort
to
legislative
history
that
is
a
bedrock
principle
of

nevertheless
the
sparse
legislative
history
regarding

the
only
legislative
history
that
has
been
cited
by

rank
among
the
least
illuminating
forms
of

the
text
is
by
far
the
more
probative
evidence
of
congress
meaning
the
nadex
order
extensive
reliance
on
this
sparse
legislative
history
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
interpretive
approach
laid
out
in
kisor
and
provides
an
additional
reason
why
kalshi
can
self
certify
the
contracts
notwithstanding
the
nadex
order
in
any
event
none
of
the
short
legislative
history
specifically
addresses
the
question
about
whether
section
applies
only
to
the
underlying
events
or
the
trading
of
the
contracts
as
well
so
it
has
nothing
to
add
to
this
analysis
provides
no
guidance
as
to
whether
congress
intended
the
commission
to
limit
the
scope
of
section
to
instances
where
the
underlying
activity
of
an
event
contract
is
one
of
the
enumerated
events
this
reading
of
section
is
consistent
with
the
terms
used
by
the
commission
in
rule
rule
borrows
heavily
from
the
terms
used
in
the
statute
including
multiple
uses
of
activity
in
both
subsections
the
regulation
also
uses
the
same
term
involves
which
appears
in
the
statute
but
also
adds
the
phrase
relates
to
or
references
when
describing
enumerated
activities
because
involves
is
the
only
statutory
authority
provided
by
congress
the
commission
can
not
expand
upon
the
scope
of
that
term
thus
the
only
way
to
read
relates
to
or
references
consistent
with
the
commission
authority
is
that
they
are
the
specific
meanings
of

that
the
commission
adopted
rule
can
not
exceed
the
scope
of
section
any
interpretation
of
rule
that
views
it
as
expanding
the
scope
delineated
in
section
would
run
afoul
of
the
constitution
separation
of
powers
and
the
administrative
procedure
act
the
terms
relates
to
and
references
in
turn
clearly
describe
the
underlying
activity
upon
which
the
event
contract
is
based
it
would
be
nonsensical
to
interpret
relates
to
and
references
as
describing
the
act
of
participating
in
the
event
contract
itself
to
be
clear
congress
could
certainly
promulgate
a
law
that
covers
the
participation
in
an
event
contract
but
section
is
not
that
law
instead
applying
the
traditional
tools
of
construction
congress
enacted
section
to
prohibit
a
narrow
group
of
contracts
whose
underlying
activities
are
the
enumerated
activities
and
the
cftc
has
determined
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
those
limitations
apply
to
rule
if
the
underlying
activity
of
a
contract
is
not
an
enumerated
event
it
is
outside
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
the
nadex
order
incorrectly
interprets
and
applies
section
and
rule
to
apply
to
political
control
contracts
like
kalshi
as
described
above
section
and
rule
apply
only
to
the
listing
of
event
contracts
whose
underlying
activity
involves
one
of
the
six
enumerated
activities
they
do
not
apply
to
event
contracts
whose
underlying
activity
does
not
involve
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
this
key
distinction
between
the
activity
itself
or
a
contract
on
the
activity
is
of
particular
importance
for
the
kalshi
contracts
at
issue
here
the
underlying
activity
of
kalshi
contracts
is
political
control
of
the
chambers
of
congress
political
control
of
congress
is
none
of
the
activities
identified
in
section
and
as
such
kalshi
political
control
contracts
are
not
subject
to
the
special
rule
the
nadex
order
contrary
conclusion
was
incorrectly
reasoned
and
misapplied
in
several
aspects
as
noted
previously
see
supra
nn

the
commission
adopted
the
nadex
order
prior
to
the
supreme
court
decision
in
kisor
wilkie
and
thus
the
order
did
not
use
the
framework
now
required
by
the
supreme
court
for
evaluating
the
scope
and
implications
of
rule
first
contrary
to
the
above
explanation
the
nadex
order
incorrectly
expanded
the
scope
of
the
statute
and
regulation
to
include
the
act
of
participating
in
the
contract
and
not
just
the
underlying
activity
second
the
nadex
order
incorrectly
includes
election
contracts
in
the
enumerated
activities
of
illegal
under
state
law
and
gaming
the
nadex
order
incorrectly
expanded
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
to
include
the
act
of
participating
in
the
contract
and
not
just
the
underlying
activity
the
first
enumerated
activity
of
section
is
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
the
underlying
activity
of
kalshi
contracts
is
political
control
of
the
chambers
of
congress
there
is
no
federal
or
state
law
that
makes
political
control
of
congress
illegal
there
is
also
no
federal
or
state
law
that
prohibits
elections
or
voting
in
elections
which
result
in
the
political
control
of
congress
accordingly
political
control
contracts
would
not
fall
under
the
special
rule
enumerated
act
of
illegal
activity
to
be
sure
27
states
do
prohibit
in
one
form
or
another
betting
on
elections
and
the
nadex
order
incorrectly
stated
that
state
gambling
definitions
of
wager
and
bet
are
analogous
to
the
act
of
taking
a
position
in
the
political
event
contracts
nadex
order
at
2
as
a
justification
for
prohibiting
those
contracts
listing
in
this
regard
however
the
nadex
order
overextended
section
is
limited
to
the
activity
underlying
the
contract
not
the
participation
in
the
contract
itself
the
nadex
order
also
misapplies
the
enumerated
activity
of
gaming
there
are
at
least
two
fundamental
differences
between
the
relevant
state
gaming
or
gambling
laws
and
event
contracts
as
commissioner
brian
quintenz
described
with
regards
to
the
withdrawn
erisx
sports
event
contract
trading
an
event
contract
with
a
binary
outcome
is
not
automatically
considered
a
gamble

the
many
other
distinctions
between
an
event
contract
and
a
gamble
include
the
fact
that
betting
is
a
game
of
pure
chance
without
any
economic
utility
while
event
contracts
are
non
chance
driven
outcomes
with
economic
utility
indeed
if
section
had
assumed
that
participating
in
any
event
contract
involved
making
a
wager
or
gamble
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
individually
enumerate
gaming
as
a
distinct
category
of
event
contracts
upon
which
the
commission
could
make
a
public
interest
determination
the
fact
that
congress
separated
gaming
from
other
event
contracts
is
a
clear
indication
that
congress
did
not
intend
for
all
event
contracts
to
be
considered
gaming
in
fact
the
statutory
definition
of
bet
or
wager
used
by
the
nadex
order
itself
in
the
same
statute
clearly
indicates
that
not
all
cftc
regulated
products
are
gaming
the
statute
cited
by
the
nadex
order
nadex
order
at
3
for
defining
bet
or
wager
is
31
a
part
of
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
of
2006
that
definition
of
bet
or
wager
however
includes
two
relevant
exclusions
first
the
term
bet
or
wager
does
not
include
any
transaction
conducted
on
or
subject
to
the
rules
of
a
registered
entity
or
exempt
board
of
trade
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
31
the
term
also
does
not
include
any
other
transaction
that
is
excluded
or
exempt
from
regulation
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
the
statute
cited
by
the
nadex
order
itself
demonstrates
that
the
nadex
order
expansive
application
of
section
and
rule
is
incorrect
the
nadex
order
broad
interpretation
of
gaming
under
the
statute
and
rule
would
result
in
prohibiting
much
of
the
legally
registered
activity
that
the
cftc
has
previously
approved

on

to

guidelines
a
contrary
interpretation
would
lead
to
the
undesirable
result
that
if
one
state
prohibited
a
specific
kind
of
contract
then
the
commission
could
use
the
special
rule
to
ban
that
contract
in
all
states
under
the
nadex
order
reasoning
because
rule
prohibits
the
listing
of
contracts
that
involve
gaming
laws
like
these
would
prohibit
all
event
contracts
for
example
event
contracts
on
the
weather
and
various
economic
indicators
would
be
considered
risking
something
of
value
upon
a
future
contingent
event
not
under
one
control
or
influence
and
yet
not
only
are
these
event
contracts
a
staple
of
cftc
regulated
dcms
but
the
commission
core
principles
require
that
event
contracts
be
specifically
outside
the
control
or
influence
of
a
market
participant
and
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation
the
nadex
order
application
of
rule
would
therefore
preclude
the
cftc
from
regulating
any
event
contract
because
event
contracts
are
considered
gambling
under
some
state
laws
on
this
point
it
seems
that
at
the
very
least
rule
would
be
an
apa
violation
or
even
unconstitutional
if
the
analysis
in
nadex
order
was
taken
to
its
logical
conclusion
because

in
this
regard
consider
for
example
the
small
cannabis
equity
index
futures
contract
listed
by
the
small
exchange
the
cannabis
index
involves
the
stock
prices
of
companies
in
the
cannabis
industry
that
produce
and
distribute
cannabis
for
consumption
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
law
and
many
state
laws
the
contract
is
dependent
on
the
occurrence
nonoccurrence
or
the
extent
of
the
occurrence
of
an
event
with
potential
financial
economic
or
commercial
consequence
see

definition
of
excluded
commodity
namely
the
value
of
the
cannabis
index
the
activities
of
these
companies
are
production
and
distribution
of
cannabis
for
consumption
which
are
all
activities
that
are
unlawful
under
federal
and
many
state
laws
and
should
otherwise
fall
under
the
purview
of
section
and
rule
certainly
if
section
was
given
the
same
broad
reading
that
the
commission
gave
to
it
in
the
nadex
order
the
cannabis
equity
index
would
certainly
involve
an
enumerated
activity
and
be
subject
to
section
and
rule
yet
the
cannabis
index
contract
was
self
certified
and
the
commission
did
not
invoke
section
or
rule
therefore
it
is
clear
that
the
commission
has
not
maintained
the
nadex
order
overbroad
and
incorrect
reading
of
the
statute
and
rule
even
if
the
proposed
kalshi
contracts
somehow
came
within
the
scope
of
section
and
rule
that
does
not
preclude
them
from
being
listed
i
understand
that
kalshi
has
made
submissions
to
the
commission
demonstrating
offering
the
contracts
would
be
in
the
public
interest
a
full
discussion
of
those
points
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
letter
i
do
note
however
that
the
commission
is
not
limited
to
using
an
economic
purpose
test
for
determining
whether
a
contract
is
within
the
public
interest
that
test
is
found
nowhere
in
the
text
of
section
or
rule
one
reference
to
the
economic
purpose
test
between
two
senators
in
a
brief
discussion
of
what
would
become
section
is
insufficient
to
bind
the
commission
to
that
test
see
supra
note

discussing
limitations
of
floor
statements
as
persuasive
evidence
of
a
statute
meaning
the
commission
recognized
as
much
in
the
nadex
order
itself
stating
the
commission
has
the
discretion
to
consider
other
factors
in
addition
to
the
economic
purpose
test
in
determining
whether
an
event
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest

order

furthermore
as
a
procedural
matter
there
is
nothing
in
the
cea
or
rule
requiring
the
commission
to
act
on
kalshi
self
certification
of
the
political
control
contracts
discussed
in
this
letter
both
section
and
rule
speak
in
terms
that
the
commission
may
determine

the
commission
may
determine
that
such
agreements
contracts
or
transactions
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
emphasis
added
7
the
commission
may
determine
that
a
contract
be
subject
to
the
90
day
review
emphasis
added
at
the
end
of
the
day
kalshi
has
various
arguments
to
justify
the
self
certification
of
the
contracts
described
above

let
me
know
if
you
need
anything
