to
whom
it
may
concern
my
name
is
sam
steyer
and
i
writing
on
behalf
of
myself
and
greenwork
where
i
co
founder
and
ceo
greenwork
is
a
software
company
that
helps
clean
energy
companies
build
their
installation
and
construction
capacity
we
offer
our
customers
tools
to
hire
skilled
tradespeople
build
a
network
of
local
contractors
and
ensure
compliance
with
labor
regulations
i
writing
in
support
of
kalshi
political
control
contracts
which
would
greatly
help
mitigate
risk
and
provide
accurate
information
for
businesses
like
ours
that
engage
in
politically
sensitive
sectors
energy
as
a
sector
has
always
been
deeply
tied
with
policy
and
regulation
from
the
earliest
days
electric
utilities
have
operated
under
a
government
granted
monopoly
and
been
subject
to
a
regulated
rate
of
return
model
the
us
government
has
been
deeply
involved
in
ensuring
access
to
oil
at
reasonable
prices
through
the
strategic
petroleum
reserve
and
negotiation
with
foreign
parties
like
opec
most
recently
we
have
been
thrilled
to
watch
the
passage
of
the
landmark
inflation
reduction
act
which
invests
369b
in
clean
energy
and
climate
work
over
10
years
and
we
view
as
foundational
to
bringing
about
a
zero
carbon
energy
transition
greenwork
has
already
experienced
the
importance
of
government
policy
very
directly
much
of
this
experience
has
been
very
positive
we
are
members
of
the
department
of
energy
better
buildings
workforce
accelerator
and
have
applied
to
both
california
and
federal
grants
policies
like
the
investment
tax
credit
and
california
net
metering
rules
are
fundamental
to
the
success
of
many
of
our
customers
in
the
solar
industry
one
early
potential
greenwork
cofounder
did
not
join
the
company
in
part
out
of
concern
that
if
an
administration
that
was
skeptical
of
clean
energy
was
elected
in
2020
it
would
undermine
our
customers
and
our
business
to
be
clear
election
risk
was
a
major
concern
for
a
co
founder
who
would
have
greatly
helped
our
business
and
will
remain
a
clear
and
tangible
risk
that
our
business
faces
going
forward
this
is
a
great
example
of
exactly
the
use
case
of
kalshi
contract
and
the
fears
that
market
participants
have
not
just
that
a
particular
policy
will
be
enacted
but
rather
that
a
government
hostile
to
our
interests
could
be
elected
who
could
implement
myriad
such
policies
through
regulation
subsidy
judicial
nominations
taxation
departmental
appointments
and
more
such
an
election
would
deter
not
just
cofounders
but
investors
and
partners
as
well
the
election
risk
is
the
thing
we
wish
to
hedge
uniquely
in
addition
decisions
like
those
would
be
made
with
more
confidence
and
certainty
if
kalshi
contracts
were
permitted
for
approval
a
market
on
election
outcomes
would
be
a
better
prediction
tool
than
current
polling
and
modeling
by
aggregating
all
information
and
having
people
put
their
personal
wealth
on
the
line
we
gladly
use
this
information
in
order
to
inform
company
decisions
as
would
others
in
the
industry
the
2022
midterms
are
no
different
the
inflation
reduction
act
of
2022
is
the
most
important
climate
and
clean
energy
legislation
ever
passed
in
the
united
states
the
way
that
it
is
implemented
over
the
coming
months
and
years
will
have
a
very
meaningful
effect
on
our
business
for
example
if
the
prevailing
wage
and
apprenticeship
requirements
in
the
bill
are
robustly
supported
as
we
expect
they
will
be
under
a
pro
labor
government
that
will
create
demand
for
hr
services
like
ours
that
help
companies
invest
in
worker
training
and
well
being
paying
more
to
provide
a
better
worker
experience
and
creating
a
market
for
greenwork
i
believe
that
small
businesses
such
as
ours
should
have
tools
to
hedge
against
political
outcomes
impacts
on
their
businesses
in
the
same
way
that
large
companies
in
practice
already
do
to
that
end
i
encourage
the
commission
to
approve
kalshi
contracts
before
the
october
28th
stated
deadline
if
at
all
possible
