cdna
is
the
doing
business
as
name
of
the
north
american

nadex
in
addition
nadex
predecessor
company
hedgestreet
was
the
first
dcm
dedicated
to

cftc
in

and

lists
products
including
event

on

and
traditional

such
as
foreign

equity
indices
and
commodities
cdna
is
a
part
of
which
was
founded
in
2016
on
a
simple
belief
it
is
a
basic
human
right
for
everyone
to
control
their
money
data
and
identity
with
over
100
million
users
on
its
platform
today
provides
a
powerful
alternative
to
traditional
financial
services
turning
its
vision
of
cryptocurrency
in
every
wallet
into
reality
one
customer
at
a
time
as
stated
in
the
event
contracts
nopr
the
cftc
is
attempting
to
make
its
event
contract
product
listing
procedures
more
efficient
and
provide
clarity
to
industry
participants
however
in
doing
so
the
cftc
takes
an
overly
prescriptive
approach
that
is
both
unnecessary
and
an
overreach
of
its
statutory
authority
as
discussed
herein
commodity
exchange
act
cea
section
unambiguously
creates
a
three
step
process
for
the
cftc
to
determine
whether
certain
event
contracts
may
be
listed
for
trading
on
or
clearing
at
cftc
registered
entities
the
commission
current
approach
to
reviewing
and
approving
event
contracts
for
listing
or
clearing
under
cftc
regulation
comports
with
this
statutory
mandate
subject
to
our
points
below
related
to
the
definition
of
excluded
commodity
the
review
process
set
forth
in
existing
cftc
regulation
does
not
require
modification
and
should
not
be
modified
we
urge
you
not
to
finalize
this
proposed
rule
as
written
and
to
consider
withdrawing
it
altogether
we
appreciate
the
commission
thoughtful
approach
to
fostering
growth
by
appropriately
tailoring
its
regulation
in
the
derivatives
markets
including
providing
meaningful
opportunities
for
industry
participants
to
engage
with
the
cftc

1
the
cftc
is
required
to
follow
the
cea
three
step
approach
to
evaluating
event
contracts
cea
section
establishes
a
three
step
inquiry
first
the
cftc
must
determine
that
the
contract
being
listed
by
the
relevant
dcm
or
swap
execution
facility
sef
is
in
an
excluded
commodity
and
is
based
on
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
this
first
step
was
barely
addressed
in
the
event
contracts
nopr
and
deserves
emphasis
it
is
unequivocal
under
the
commodity
exchange
act
that
the
cftc
can
not
use
its
authority
under
section
to
prohibit
certain
types
of
event
contracts
where
the
contract
in
question
involves
an
exempt
or
agricultural
commodity
for
this
reason
we
believe
that
the
cftc
must
articulate
its
justification
for
determining
that
a
given
contract
has
an
underlying
excluded
commodity
this
should
not
be
a
foregone
conclusion
as
an
example
if
the
cftc
believes
that
an
event
contract
based
on
the
outcome
of
a
senate
race
involves
an
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
a
contingency
under
cea
section
the
cftc
must
also
articulate
how
that
contract
is
associated
with
a
financial
commercial
or
economic
consequence
to
be
clear
cdna
expresses
no
view
as
to
whether
any
such
political
event
contract
is
based
on
an
underlying
excluded
commodity
but
urges
the
cftc
to
transparently
justify
its
conclusion
on
this
point
to
ensure
that
it
is
complying
with
its
statutorily
mandated
review
process
second
the
cftc
must
examine
whether
an
event
contract
in
a
specified
excluded
commodity
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
the
enumerated
activities
under
the
cea
are
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
terrorism
assassination
war
gaming
or
other
similar
activity
determined
by
the
cftc
by
rule
or
regulation
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
once
the
cftc
determines
that
the
contract
involves
such
activity
the
commission
must
assess
whether
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
cea
section
under
the
event
contracts
nopr
the
cftc
would
categorically
conclude
that
any
event
contract
involving
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
thereby
eliminating
one
step
in
the
three
step
inquiry
that
is
required
under
the
cea
the
commission
is
correct
that
it
has
statutory
authority
to
make
this
public
interest
determination
but
it
is
incorrect
that
it
can
do
so
categorically
for
entire
classes
of
event
contracts
if
congress
had
wanted
to
prohibit
entire
swaths
of
event
contracts
based
on
the
enumerated
activities
without
any
further
analysis
then
it
could
have
done
so
congress
had
the
ability
to
draft
much
more
simply
the
following
types
of
event
contracts
are
prohibited
but
it
did
not
a
plain
reading
of
the
statute
suggests
that
the
cftc
is
required
to
undergo
some
review
of
each
individual
contract
that
fits
within
the
realm
of
cea
section
and
in
fact
this
section
of
the
cea
is
titled
special
rule
for
review
and
approval
of
event
contracts
and
swaps
contracts
we
urge
the
cftc
not
to
sidestep
its
obligations
to
undergo
a
three
step
review
process
with
respect
to
these
types
of
event
contracts
and
to
eliminate
this
aspect
of
the
event
contracts
nopr
2
the
existing
product
certification
process
serves
as
an
effective
control
on
listing
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
we
believe
that
the
cftc
process
for
certification
of
listing
products
for
trading
and
clearing
is
sufficient
to
protect
the
public
interest
cftc
regulations
and
establish
the
rules
a
dcm
swap
execution
facility
sef
or
dco
must
follow
to
list
a
product
for
trading
or
clearing
on
its
platform
to
list
a
new
contract
a
dcm
sef
or
dco
must
provide
the
cftc
with
a
concise
explanation
and
analysis
of
the
product
and
its
compliance
with
applicable
provisions
of
the
cea
including
core
principles
and
the
commission
regulations
thereunder
cftc
regulation
as
self
regulatory
organizations
dcms
are
well
equipped
to
promulgate
and
enforce
rules
that
limit
the
risks
contemplated
by
the
event
contract
nopr
as
the
event
contract
nopr
notes
nadex
has
a
long
history
of
listing
event
contracts
that
conform
to
the
cea
and
cftc
regulations
as
they
exist
the
same
listing
standards
that
have
supported
a
healthy
event
contract
market
for
15
years
apply
to
established
and
emerging
exchanges
alike
even
those
that
are
interested
in
listing
novel
event
contracts
3
the
cftc
should
seek
clarity
from
congress
regarding
cea
section
as
noted
in
the
event
contracts
nopr
there
is
no
section
in
the
cea
despite
the
fact
that
this
section
is
referenced
in
cea
section
the
cftc
can
speculate
about
congress
intended
meaning
but
it
should
not
it
is
for
congress
to
decide
what
the
correct
reference
was
intended
to
be
it
seems
quite
possible
that
this
was
a
drafting
error
when
the
statute
was
amended
and
congress
is
the
appropriate
body
to
clarify
this
point
and
identify
the
correct
reference
in
cea
section
not
the
cftc
cdna
is
supportive
of
well
crafted
effective
regulation
of
derivatives
markets
and
supports
the
cftc
goal
to
ensure
that
event
contracts
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
are
within
the
public
interest
the
cftc
can
accomplish
this
through
a
principles
based
approach
and
without
modifying
cftc
regulation
or
its
interpretation
of
cea
section
unless
directed
to
do
so
by
congress
we
welcome
the
opportunity
to
discuss
our
comments
in
further
detail
sincerely
