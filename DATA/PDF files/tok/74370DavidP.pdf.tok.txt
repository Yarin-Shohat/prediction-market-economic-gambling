i
am
writing
to
express
my
concern
regarding
the
proposal
to
ban
election
contracts
and
prediction
markets
instead
of
an
outright
ban
i
believe
there
should
be
a
robust
regulatory
framework
to
ensure
these
markets
operate
safely
and
transparently
within
the
united
states
banning
election
markets
risks
pushing
this
valuable
activity
to
offshore
and
unregulated
platforms
where
there
is
no
consumer
protection
or
oversight
this
could
lead
to
increased
risks
of
fraud
and
market
manipulation
undermining
the
very
integrity
the
ban
seeks
to
protect
proper
regulation
can
address
potential
concerns
while
preserving
the
benefits
these
markets
offer
prediction
markets
provide
valuable
insights
into
public
sentiment
and
can
serve
as
important
tools
for
hedging
against
political
risks
by
establishing
clear
guidelines
and
oversight
mechanisms
the
cftc
can
ensure
that
these
markets
contribute
positively
to
the
financial
ecosystem
i
urge
the
cftc
to
reconsider
its
proposal
and
focus
on
developing
a
regulatory
framework
that
allows
election
markets
to
operate
legally
and
effectively
this
approach
would
support
innovation
enhance
market
efficiency
and
protect
participants
ensuring
that
the
remains
a
leader
in
financial
market
innovation
