are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
while
the
term
event
contract
is
not
defined
in
the
cea
or
the
cftc
regulations
event
contracts
are
generally
understood
to
be
a
type
of
derivative
contract
typically
with
a
binary
payoff
structure
based
on
the
outcome
of
an
underlying
occurrence
or
event
most
event
contracts
that
have
traded
or
are
currently
trading
on
cftc
registered
exchanges
are
structured
as
binary
options
which
are
generally
understood
as
a
type
of
option
whose
payout
is
either
a
fixed
amount
or
zero
a
registered
entity
that
seeks
to
list
event
contracts
for
trading
or
make
event
contracts
available
for

must
comply

the
substantive
and
procedural
requirements
that
apply
more
generally
to
the
listing
for
trading
or
making
available
for
clearing
of
derivative
contracts
for
example
cftc
registered
exchanges
namely
dcms
and
sefs
are
subject
to
statutory
requirements
to
only
list
or
permit
trading
in
derivative
contracts
that
are
not
readily
susceptible
to
manipulation

and

in
addition
to
the
more
generally
applicable
requirements
to
which
registered
entities
are
subject
when
listing
derivative
contracts
for
trading
or
making
such
contracts
available
for
clearing
cea
section
grants
the
commission
the
authority
to
prohibit
registered
entities
from
listing
for
trading
or
making
available
for
clearing
particular
types
of
event
contracts
if
the
commission
determines
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
since
2021
the
commission
has
observed
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
of
event
contracts
listed
for
trading
by
cftc
registered
exchanges
as
well
as
in
the
diversity
of
occurrences
and
events
underlying
such
contracts
from
2006
2020
dcms
listed
for
trading
an
average
of
approximately
five
event
contracts
per
year
in
2021
this
number
increased
to
131
and
the
number
of
newly
listed
event
contracts
per
year
has
remained
at
a
similar
level
in
subsequent
years
since
2021
dcms
also
have
listed
for
trading
a
substantial
number
of
event
contracts
not
associated
with
traditional
commodities
financial
indices
or
economic
indicators
these
have
included
event
contracts
based
on
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
international
events
natural
disasters
in
specific
cities
heating
cooling
degree
days
and
cumulative
average

and
the

before
a
certain
date
the
commission
has
also
observed
recent
applications
for
exchange
registration
and
expressions
of
interest
regarding
exchange
registration
from
entities
that
have
indicated
that
they
are
interested
primarily
or
exclusively
in
listing
event
contracts
for
trading
as
of
february
12
2024
commission
staff
were
reviewing
several
pending
applications
for
contract
market
designation
from
entities
with
a
stated
interest
in
offering
event
contracts
for
trading
commission
staff
have
received
multiple
additional
inquiries
from
other
entities
indicating
an
interest
in
applying
for
exchange
registration
in
order
to
offer
event
contracts
for
trading
in
light
of
these
developments
the
commission
proposes
to
amend
to
further
specify
types
of
event
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
cea
section
and
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
believes
that
these
amendments
would
support
efforts
by
registered
entities
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
by
more
clearly
identifying
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
the
commission
believes
that
these
amendments
would
correspondingly
assist
registered
entities
as
well
as
applicants
for
registration
in
making
informed
business
decisions
with
respect
to
product
design
which
would
help
to
support
responsible
market
innovation
the
commission
believes
that
amending
to
further
specify
types
of
event
contracts
that
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
would
also
benefit
the
commission
and
its
staff
by
reducing
the
need
to
undertake
individualized
resource
intensive
contract
reviews
as
further
discussed
below
under
the
commission
may
initiate
a
90
day
review
to
evaluate
whether
a
particular
event
contract
is
of
a
type
that
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
further
specifying
in
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
should
provide
registered
entities
with
a
better
understanding
regarding
appropriate
event
contract
parameters
and
should
in
turn
reduce
the
likelihood
that
contract
filings
that
raise
potential
public
interest
concerns
are
submitted
to
the
commission
from
a
resource
allocation
perspective
this
will
be
of
significant
benefit
to
the
commission
and
its
staff
since
in
the
commission
experience
a
single
review
is
resource
intensive
and
consumes
hundreds
of
hours
of
staff
time
finally
the
commission
proposes
to
make
certain
amendments
to
to
further
align
the
language
of
the
regulation
with
the
statutory
text
of
cea
section
and
also
proposes
to
make
certain
technical
amendments
to
the
regulation
in
order
to
enhance
clarity
and
organization

prospective

for

registration
in
operating

that

primarily
or
exclusively
offer

the
commission
is
proposing
to
amend
to
among
other
things
further
specify
types
of
event

that
fall
within
the
scope
of

section
and

the
commission
believes
that
these
proposed
amendments
would
support
efforts
by
registered

to
ensure
compliance
with
the
cea
and
would
correspondingly
assist
registered
entities
as

as
applicants
for

in
making
informed
business
decisions
with

to
product
design
thereby
helping
to
support
responsible
market
innovation
the
commission
further
believes
that
by
helping
to
delineate
appropriate
event
contract
parameters
the
proposed
amendments
would
reduce
the
frequency

of

described

there
is
no
section
in
the

and
the
commission
believes
the
reference
to
this
provision
in
cea

is
a
typographical
or
drafting
error
cea
section

defines
an
appropriate
federal
banking
agency
which
is
not
relevant
to
the

in

the
commission
interpreted
the
excluded
commodities
falling
within
the
scope
of
cea

to
be
those
set
forth
in
cea
section
and
accordingly
referenced
cea
section
in
and
while
the
adopting
release
did
not
discuss
the
basis
for
this
interpretation
it
is
likely
that
the
commission
assumed
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
the
statutory
language
of
the
excluded
commodity
definition
set
forth
in
cea

since
cea
section
tracks
the
language
of
cea

to
a
large
extent
the

definition
set
forth
in

is
as
follows
an

with
the
aim
of
adhering
as
closely
as
possible
to
the

while
by
necessity
having
to
account
for
the
errant
reference
in
cea

to

which
is
not
a

in

the

is
proposing
to

described
in

of
the
act
emphasis
added
these
proposed
amendments
would
achieve
two
purposes
first
the
proposed
amendments
would
remove
from
the
relevant
rules
the
current
reference
to
cea
section
and
would
more
precisely
track
the
text
of
cea
section
second
the
proposed
amendments
would
clarify
the
commission
interpretation
that
the
reference
to
section
in
cea
section
was
intended
by
congress
to
refer
to
the
excluded
commodities
described
in
cea

or

this
interpretation
carves
out
from
the
scope
of
cea
section
event
contracts
based
on
a
change
in
the
price
rate
value
or
levels
of
these
measures

and

the
measures
indices
and
instruments
described
in
cea

served
as
underlyings
for
a
range
of
derivative
contracts
that
were
broadly
traded
on
cftc
registered

at
the
time
of

the
commission
believes
that
it
is
unlikely
that

intended
the
heightened

granted
to
the

in

to
apply
with
respect
to
event
contracts
based
on
changes
in
the

rate
value
or

of
these

consistent
with
the
commission
view
that
the
reference
to

was
intended
by

to
refer
to
the
excluded

described

included
as
a

the

the
commission
notes
that
it

and
by

b
illustrative

not

the

believes
that

would
benefit
from
the

providing
examples
of
the
types
of
event

that
in
the
commission
view
fall
outside

and
by

for
the
avoidance
of

with
respect
to
these
types
of

a
registered

still
must
comply
with
the
substantive
and

requirements
that
apply
more
generally
to

the
statutory
requirement
to
ensure
that
such

the

this

as

for

in
making
informed

the

including
the
outcome
of

this
would
include
the

the

proposing

to
include
the
staking

of
something
of
value
on
a
contingent

in

with

the

proposes
to

a
non

of
examples
of

that
constitute

as
proposed
to
be

in

with
such
a

the

emphasizes
that
the

of

provided

non

to
the
extent
that
other
activity
falls
within
the
definition

set
forth
at

such

would
also
constitute

the
first
three
examples
in

non

reflect
types
of
games
or
contests
which
when
something
of
value
is
staked
or
risked
upon
their
outcome
have
been
recognized
as
gambling

statutes
and
would
constitute

under
the
proposed
definition
in
see
section
supra
the
first
example
reflects
the
commission
prior
determinations
that
gaming
includes
the
staking
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
in
the
nadex
order
which
addressed
certain
event
contracts
on
election
outcomes
the
commission
found
that
state
gambling
definitions
of
wager
and
bet
were
analogous
to
the
act
of
taking
a
position
in
the
subject
contracts
additionally
the
commission
cited
to
the
uigea
definition
of
the
term
bet
or
wager
and
found
that
taking
a
position
in
the
subject
contracts
fit
the
plain
meaning
of
a
person
staking
something
of
value
upon
a
contest
of
others
since
the
contracts
were
all
premised
either
directly
or
indirectly
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
between
electoral
candidates
as
in
the
nadex
order
in
the
kalshi

the
commission
looked
to
definitions
of
the
terms
gaming
gambling
and
bet
or
wager
including
state
and
federal
statutory
definitions
and
found
that
the
subject
contracts
involved
gaming
since
taking
a
position
in
the
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
the
contracts
were
premised
on
the
outcome
of
congressional
election
contests
as
discussed
infra

found
in

that
the

the

clarifies
however
that
it
believes
that
cyberattacks

other
acts

constitute

the

notes
that
the

that

conducted
in

in

kalshi
order
evaluated
whether
the
subject
congressional
control
contracts
involved
this
enumerated
activity
in
the
kalshi
order
the
commission
found
that
in
many
states
betting
or
wagering
on
elections
is
prohibited
by
statute
or
common
law
and
the
commission
cited
to

on

and
because

the

that
was
unlawful
under

the

found
that
because
taking

so
transacting
these

can
not
in
and
of
itself
be
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
law
however
such
contracts
may
still
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
a
state
law
in
the
sense
for
example
that
transactions
in
the
contracts
may
relate
closely
to
entail
or
have
as
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
an
activity
that
violates
state
law
for
example
in
the
kalshi
order
the
commission
found
that
state
laws
which
are
not
preempted
by
the
cea
prohibit
wagering
on

the
commission
found
that
taking
a
position
in
the
subject
congressional
control
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
contests
between
electoral
candidates
such
that
wagering
on
elections
was
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
of
the
contracts
accordingly
the
commission
found
that
while
transactions
in
the
contracts
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
would
not
violate
for
example
state
bucket
shop
laws
they
nevertheless
involved
an
activity
that
is
unlawful
in
a
number
of
states
wagering
on
elections
the
commission
found
that
to
permit
such
transactions
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
would
undermine
important
state
interests
expressed
in
statutes
separate
and
apart
from
those
applicable
to

the
commission
anticipates
that
that
the
agency
would
in
the
future
follow
a
similar
approach
including
a
survey
of
relevant
law
in
circumstances
where
there
is
a
question
regarding
whether
an
event

submitted
to
the

involves

that
is
unlawful
under
any
state
or
federal
law
for

that
many
state
codes
include
laws
prohibiting
certain
activity
that
while
not
repealed
are
generally
considered
archaic
and
are
not

the
commission
believes
that
it
is
unlikely
that
a
registered
entity
would
seek
to
list
for
trading
or
accept

clearing
an

contract

does
make
a
submission
to
the
commission
regarding
a

that

the
commission
believes
that
it
may
be
appropriate

of
the

pursuant

evaluate
whether
in

it

not

while

differs
from

does
suggest
an
intent
on

part
of
the
drafters
of

for
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
a
contract
to
be
relevant
considerations
in
a

review
under

as
noted
this
is
not
inconsistent
with
the

taken
in
assessing
whether
a

was
contrary
to
the
public
interest
under
former
cea
section
which
contemplated
application
of
the
economic

test
in
this
regard
the
commission
notes
further
that
the
general
findings
and
purpose
provision
of
the
cea
at
cea
section
states
that
transactions
subject
to
the
cea
are
affected
with
a
national
public

by
providing
a
means
for
managing
and
assuming

information

accordingly
the
cea
recognizes
hedging
as
a
public
interest
which
certain
transactions
subject
to
the
cea
transactions
providing
a
means
for
managing
and
assuming
price
risk
are
intended
to
serve
as
such
the
commission
recognizes
the
utility
of
a
contract
or
category
contracts
for
purposes
of
hedging
and
price
basing
to
be
relevant
factors
for
consideration
in
evaluating
whether
the
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
pursuant
to
cea
section
the
commission
considered
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
in
its
previous
orders
under

section
and
see

in
the
kalshi
order
the
commission
found
among
other
things
that
the
event
underlying
the
subject
contracts
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
did
not
in
and
of
itself
have
sufficiently
direct
predictable
or
quantifiable
economic
consequences
for
the
contracts
to
serve
an
effective
hedging
function
the
commission
found
that
since
the
economic
effects
of
control
of
a
chamber
of
congress
are
diffuse
and
unpredictable
the
price
of
the
subject
contracts
was
not
directly
correlated
to
the
price
of
any
commodity
and
so
the
price
of
the
contracts
could
not
predictably
be
used
to
establish
commercial
transaction
prices
the
commission
found
that
even
if
some
level
of
political
risk
may
be
embedded
in
the
price
of
many
commercial
transactions
that
did
not
in
itself
support
a
finding
that
the
subject
contracts
served
a
price
basing
function
kalshi

similarly
in
the
nadex
order
the
commission
found
that
the
unpredictability
of
the
specific
economic
consequences
of
an
election
means
that
the
subject
contracts
can
not
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging
purposes
nadex
order
at
3
the
commission
found
that
there
was
no
situation
in
which
the
subject
contracts
prices
could
form
the
basis
for
the
pricing
of
a
commercial
transaction
financial
asset
or
service
which
demonstrated
that
the
contracts
did
not
have
price

utility
i
d
while
the
articulation
of
the
approach
to
evaluating
hedging
and
pricebasing
utility
differs
in
the
2010
colloquy
and
under
the
pre
cfma
economic
purpose
test
the
commission
anticipates
that
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
that
does
not
satisfy
one
such
articulation
also
would
likely
not
satisfy
the
other
in
this
regard
the
commission
reiterates
that
it
has
the
discretion
to
consider
other
factors
in
addition
to
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
in
its
evaluation
of
whether
a
contract
or

of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
purposes
of
cea
section
for
example
in
both
the
nadex
order
and
the
kalshi

the
commission
highlighted
the

that
would

terrorism
assassination
and

as
activities
that
pose
a
threat
to
national
and
international
security
and
entail
violence

the
commission
believes
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
allow
event
contracts
involving
such
activities
to
trade
on
cftc
regulated
markets
the
commission
believes
that
allowing
such
contracts
to
trade
would
raise
a
real
risk
that
the
contracts
and
markets
for
the
contracts
could
be
used
to
profit
from
devastating
events
allowing
trading
in
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination
or
war
could
incentivize
certain
market
participants
to
take
a
speculative
position
on
whether
these
devastating
events
will
occur
or
how
wide
reaching
their
impact
will
be
a
type
of
speculation
that
the
commission
believes
at
a
base
level
is
offensive
and
has
no
place
in
cftc
regulated
markets
allowing
trading
in
such
contracts
might
even
increase
the
risk
of
a
terrorist
attack
assassination
or
act
of
war
by
creating
financial
incentives
for
a
potential
perpetrator
to
take

position
in
such
a
contract
and
then
profit
by
carrying
out
the
heinous
act
that
the
contract
involves
the
national
and
international
security
concerns
and
threat
to
the
public
good
raised
by
terrorism
assassination
and

are
so
significant
that
the
commission
must
consider
very

by
allowing

believes
that
it
is

the
commission
thus
believes
that
permitting
trading
on
cftcregulated
markets
in
contracts
that
involve
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
and
potentially
in
some
circumstances
creating
opportunities
to
profit
from
illegal
activity
would
undermine
important
state
interests
expressed
in
state
statutes
and
common
law
in
protecting
the
public
good
while
the
commission
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over

and
swaps
contracts
traded
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
preempting
the
application
of
state
law
with
respect
to
such
transactions
and
meaning
that
transacting
in
such
contracts
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
can
not
of
itself
constitute
unlawful
activity
for
state
law
purposes
this
does
not
preclude
a
contract
from
involving
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state

for
purposes
of

this
is
also
a

the
commission
notes
that
there
are
variations
across
state
law
in
the
specific
activities
that
are
recognized
as
unlawful
the
commission
believes
that
a
determination
that
an
event
contract
that
involves
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
state
law
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
which
turns
the
focus
of
the
analysis
to
the
questions
of
whether
the
activity
itself
is
recognized
as
unlawful
and
if
so
whether
the
contract
involves
such
unlawful
activity
eliminates
the
possibility

as
discussed

the
commission
is
proposing

the

draws
upon
the
approach
taken
in

state
and
federal
statutory
definitions
to
defining
the
terms

betting
or

which
as
discussed
above
are
generally
used
interchangeably
with
the

the
commission
proposes
to
amend
to
include
a
determination
that
any
contract
that
involves
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
is
contrary

both

taken
in

the

is
aware
that
the
legal
landscape
with
respect
to
certain
forms
of

has
changed
since
cea
section
was
adopted
in

and
was
adopted
in

specifically
in

gambling
on

or
permitting

to
operate
and
promote
such
sports
gambling
schemes
following
this
decision
many
states
have
legalized
various
forms
of
sports
gambling
the
commission
highlights
however
the
determination
of
congress
to
identify
gaming
as
an
enumerated
activity
separate
and
apart
from
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
federal
or
state
law
this
indicates
congressional
intent
supported
by
the
2010
colloquy
to
empower
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contracts
that
would
effectively
serve
as
a
wagering
vehicle
subject
to
a
commission
determination
that
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
to
this
point
the

notes
that
there

of
legalized

in
the
united
states
when

was
adopted

in
states
such

the
commission
believes
that
the
economic
impact
of
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
others
or
a
game
of
skill
or
chance
including
the
outcome
of
such
contest
or

generally
is
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
correlate
to
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
price
of
commodities
or
other
financial
assets
or
instruments
limiting
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
an
event
contract
involving
such
an
occurrence
generally
speaking
the
commission
believes
that
something
of
value
is
staked
or
risked
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
of
others
or
a
game
or
skill
or
chance
for
entertainment
purposes
in
order
wager
on
the
occurrence
as
such
the
commission
believes
that
contracts
involving
such
occurrences
are
likely
to
be
traded
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
and
used
predominantly
by
speculators
or
participants
not
having
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
and
can
not
reasonably
expected
to
be
used
for
hedging

on
more
than
an
occasional
basis

supra
while
there
may
be
individuals
or
entities
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequences
the
commission
believes
that
any
such
segment
of
individuals
or
entities
is
likely
to
be
narrow
as
compared
to
the
broader
universe
of
market
participants
including
retail
market
participants
who
may
be
able
to
trade
in
an
event
contract
listed
on
a
cftc
registered
exchange
and
who
the
commission
believes
are
most
likely
to
trade
such
contract
for
entertainment
purposes
only
moreover
the
commission
believes
that
an
individual
or
entity
for
whom
a
particular
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
may
have
more
direct
and
more
predictable
economic
consequences
may
also
be
more
likely
to
have
access
to
information
influence
that
could
be
used
to
engage
in
activity
that
could
artificially
move
the
market
in
an
event
contract
involving
such
occurrence
potentially
raising
heightened
manipulation
concerns
for
example
a
professional
athlete
or
coach
may
be
economically
impacted
by
their
team
wins
or
losses
but
may
also
have
access
to
information
for
example
about
a
team
member
health
or
a
potential
injury
that
could
be
used
to
trade
ahead
of
the
market
in
an
event
contract
involving
the
team
performance
further
the
athlete
or
coach
would
potentially
have
a
platform
for
example
access
to
media
combined
with
public
perception
as
an
authoritative
source
of
information
regarding
the
team
that
could
be
used
to
disseminate
misinformation
that
could
artificially
impact
the
market
in
the
contract
for
additional
financial
gain
in
this
regard
the
commission
notes
that
in
order
to
address
concerns
about
the
potential
to
undermine
the
integrity
of
a
sporting
event
or
wagering
thereon
a
number
of
states
have
established
prohibitions
on
sports
wagers
for
certain
categories
of
individuals
when
they
are
involved
in
a
particular
sporting
event
including

the

the
outcome

are
prohibited
by

the

of

that

the

additionally
notes

a

may
be
able

be
the
case
for

not

affect

the

believes
that

be
akin
to
novelty
if

an

the
commission
further
notes
that
most
contracts
falling
within
the
proposed
definition
of

would
have
no

with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
directly

price
forming
information
rather
price
forming
information
is
either
nonexistent
or
driven
by
informational
sources
that
are
unregulated
have
opaque
underlying
processes
and
procedures
and
may
not
follow
scientifically
reliable
methodologies
notably
the
most
useful
source
of
price
forming
information
with
respect
to
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
would
likely
be
prices
of
similar
wagers
in
gambling
and
sport
betting
facilities
the
commission
believes
that
this
fact
further
supports
the
commission
view
that
trading
in
such
gaming
contracts
would
effectively
amount
to
betting
or
wagering

the

for

of

may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating

of
such
contracts
while
decreasing
the
ability
of
the

the

to
detect

other

considerations
also
weigh
against
permitting
the
trading
on
cftcregulated
markets
of
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
the
commission
believes
that
permitting
such
contracts
to
trade
as
financial
instruments
on
financial
markets
could
raise
broad
investor
protection
concerns
by
conflating
gambling
and
financial
instruments
in
a
manner
that
could
particularly
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
market
participants
among
other
things
it
could
improperly
signal
to
certain
retail
investors
that
these
contracts
are
instruments
to
be
used
for
investment
purposes
and
it
could
signal
to
others
that
derivative
markets
are
appropriate
venues
for
retail
market
participants
to
trade
for
entertainment
purposes
which
could
minimize
for
those
investors
unique
characteristics
and
risks
of

in

permitting
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
to
trade
on
cftc

would
in
effect
permit
instruments
commonly
understood
as
bets
or
wagers
on
contests
or
games
to
avoid
these
legal
regimes
and
protections
gambling
is
a
rapidly
evolving
field
and
the
commission
does
not
believe
that
it
has
the
statutory
mandate
nor
specialized
experience
appropriate
to
oversee
it
or
that
congress
intended
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
or
expend
its
resources
in
this
manner
see
note

supra
for
examples
of
certain
evolving
risks
related
to
certain
bets
or
wagers
on
contests
or
games
the
commission
notes
that
the
non
exclusive
list
of
examples
of
gaming
set
forth
in
proposed
includes
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
or
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
consistent
with
its
determinations
in
the
nadex
order
and
the
kalshi
order
the
commission
believes
that
permitting
trading
on
cftc
regulated
markets
in
this
particular
sub
set
of
gaming
contracts
would
raise
unique
additional
public
interest
concerns
relating
to
election
integrity
and
the
perception
of
election
integrity
and
the
appropriate
role
of
the
commission
in
this
area
the
commission
believes
that
permitting
trading
in
contracts
involving
political
contests
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
or
concerning
a
supranational
organization
also
would
raise
these
public
interest
concerns
just
as
permitting
trading
in
contracts
involving
political
contest
in
the
united
states
would
for
example
permitting
trading
in
these
types
of
contracts
could
create
monetary
incentives
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
even
when
such
votes
may
be
contrary
to
a
voter
or
organized
groups
of
voters
political
views
it
would
also
raise
concerns
that
conduct
designed
to
artificially
affect
the
electoral
process
could
be
used
to
manipulate
the
markets
in
such
contracts
or
conversely
that
the
markets
in
such
contracts
could
be
manipulated
to
influence
elections
or
electoral
perceptions
for
example
false
reporting
or
other
misinformation
such
as
inaccurate
polling
or
voter
surveys
or
false
news
reporting
could
be
used
to
distort
the
information
underlying
price
formation
in
such
contracts
certain
commenters
on
the
contracts
subject
to
the
kalshi
order
asserted
that
event
contracts
involving
occurrences
in
connection
with
political
election
contests
could
serve
as
a
check
on
misinformation
and
inaccurate
polling
stating
that
market
based
alternatives
tend
to
be
more
accurate
than
polling
or
other
methods
of
predicting
election
outcomes
see
kalshi
order
at
22
the
commission
notes
that
there
is
also
research
suggesting
that
election
markets
may
incentivize
the
creation
of
fake
or
unreliable
information
in
the
interest
of
moving
the
market
a
number
of
commenters
on
the
contracts
subject
to
the
kalshi

also
raised
this
concern

how

and
suggesting
that

to

further
arguing
that
such
false

can
have
a
real
and
detrimental
effect
on

the
commission
notes
further
that
there
is
no
underlying
cash
market
for
political
event
contracts
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
directly
correlated
price
forming
information
rather
price
forming
information
is
driven
in
large
measure
by
polling
and
other
informational
sources
that
are
unregulated
frequently
have
opaque
underlying
processes
and
procedures
and
may
not
follow
scientifically
reliable
methodologies
the
opaque
and
unregulated
sources
of
price
forming
information
for
such
contracts
may
increase
the
risk
of
manipulative
activity
relating
to
the
trading
and
pricing
of
the
contracts
while
decreasing
the
ability
of
the
listing
registered
entity
and
the
commission
to
detect
such
activity
the
commission
notes
further
that
it
is
not
tasked
with
the
protection
of
election
integrity
or
enforcement
of
campaign
finance
laws
however
if
trading
was
permitted
on
cftc
registered
exchanges
in
event
contracts
that
involve
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
a
political
contest
then
the
commission
could
find
itself
investigating
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
while
certain
commodities
outside
the
commission
direct
remit
do
underlie
derivatives
without
giving
rise
to
significant
problems
due
to
the
special
role
of
elections
in
our
society
the
commission
believes
that
the
oversight
function
in
this
area
is
best
reserved
for
other
expert
bodies
of
course
governmental
bodies
are
tasked
with
that
function
but
the
commission
has
both
the
authority
and
responsibility
to
address
fraud
false
reporting
and
manipulation
in
markets
for
derivatives
that
trade
on
cftc
registered

as
such
if
trading
were
permitted
in
event
contracts
that
involve
the
staking
or

of
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
or
upon
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
the
commission
would
have
a
statutory
responsibility
to
exercise
its
surveillance
investigation
and
enforcement
authority
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
the
markets
in
such
contracts
conversely
attempts
at
manipulation
of
such
markets
could
have
broader
electoral
implications
similarly
drawing
the
commission
into
investigations
of
election
related
activities
indeed
accusations
of
fraud
have
been
leveled
at
government
bodies
tasked
with
administering
elections
such
scenarios
underscore
for
the
commission
that
it
has
no
appropriate
role
in
this
area
again
the
commission
does
not
have
the
specialized
experience
appropriate
for
this
role
and
believes
that
it
is
unlikely
that
congress
intended
for
the
commission
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
or
expend
its
resources
this
way
the
unique
additional
public
interest
concerns
that
would
be
raised
by
permitting
the
trading
on
a
registered

of
an
event
contract
that
involves
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of

request
for
comment
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
proposed
technical
amendments
to
implementation
timeline
the
commission
proposes
that
the
final
rule
amendments
be
effective
30
days
after
publication
in
the
federal
register
the
commission
believes
that
this
30
day
period
should
provide
registered
entities
with
sufficient
time
to
account
for
the
rule
amendments
in
their
product
design
and
compliance
procedures
however
the
commission
also
proposes
an
implementation
period
that
would
run
for
an
additional
30
days
after
the
effective
date
of
the
final
rule
amendments
for
a
total
of
60
days
from
the
date
of
publication
of
the
final
rule
amendments
in
the
federal
register
solely
for
event
contracts
that
are
listed
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
the
final
rule
amendments
and
that
are
impacted
by
the
amendments
the
commission
believes
that
a
60
day
implementation
period
for
these
contracts
will
minimize
any
market
disruption
that
might
be
caused
by
the
rule
amendments
in
this
regard
the
commission
notes
that
event
contracts
are
generally
based
upon
a
discrete
occurrence
or
event
and
commission
staff
anecdotal
experience
indicates
that
many
event
contracts
settle
within
relatively
short
time
horizons
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
as
discussed
further
in
section
infra
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
currently
comprise
a
small
portion
of
the
overall
event
contracts
market
suggests
that
few
event
contracts
impacted
by
the
proposed
rule
amendments
if
finalized
would
need
to
be
wound
down
before
their
existing
settlement
dates

note
171
infra
to
the
extent
that
a
particular
event
contract
that
is
impacted
by
the
rule
amendments
has
a
settlement
date
that
extends
beyond
the
implementation
period
the
commission
believes
that
60
days
would
provide
sufficient
time
for
the
registered
entity
to
ensure
the
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
the
contract
for
the
avoidance
of
doubt
the
proposed
extended
60
day
implementation
period
would
apply
only
to
contracts
that
are
listed
and
available
for
trading
as
of
the
date
of
publication
of
the
final
rule
amendments
in
the
federal

the
extended
implementation

would
not
apply
to

that
have

not
listed

for

as

the
date

in

federal

the
interest
in
minimizing
market
disruption
that
informs
the
proposed
extended
implementation
period
does
not
apply
to
such
contracts
all
registered
entities
are
expected
to
make
good
faith
efforts
that
will
result
in
conformance
with
the
final
rule
amendments
by
no
later
than
the
effective
date
of
the
final
amendments
or
the
60

implementation

these

efforts
should
take

registered

whose

steps
with

the

anticipates
that
for

one
step
will
be
filing
self
certification
submissions
to
permanently
delist
the
contracts
and
remove
reference
to
them
from
their
exchange
rules
in
this
context
delisting
refers
to
the
process
of
submitting
rule
amendments
to
the
commission
in
order
to
withdraw
self
certified
or
approved
contracts
meaning
they
can
no
longer
be
listed
for
trading
on
the
exchange
regardless
of
whether
such
contracts
are
currently
available
to
market
participants
for

these
filings
are
additional
burdens
under

pra
and
would
increase

additional
costs
associated

are
laid
out

the

estimates

the
proposed

1
introduction
section
of
the
cea
requires
the
commission
to
consider
the
costs
and
benefits
of
its
actions
before
promulgating
a
regulation
under
the
cea
or
issuing
certain
orders
7
section
further
specifies
that
the
costs
and
benefits
shall
be
evaluated
in
light
of
five
broad
areas
of
market
and
public
concern
1
protection
of
market
participants
and
the
public
2
efficiency
competitiveness
and
financial
integrity
of
futures
markets
3
price
discovery
4
sound
risk
management
practices
and
5
other
public
interest
considerations
the
commission
considers
the
costs
and
benefits
resulting
from
its
discretionary
determinations
with
respect
to
the
section
factors
while
as
discussed
previously
and
further
below
the
commission
believes
the
amendments
proposed
herein
measured
relative
to
the
baseline
of
status
quo
conditions
would
create
meaningful
benefits
for
market
participants
and
the
public
it
also
recognizes
that
they
likely
would
result
in
some
incremental
costs
the
commission
has
endeavored
to
enumerate
material
costs
and
benefits
and
when
reasonably
feasible
assign
a
quantitative
value
to
them
where
it
is
not
reasonably
feasible
to
quantify
costs
and
benefits
of
the
proposed
amendments
those
costs
and
benefits
are
discussed
qualitatively
the
commission
notes
that
this
cost
benefit
consideration
is
based
on
its
understanding
that
the
derivatives
market
regulated
by
the
commission
functions
internationally
with
1
transactions
that
involve
persons
occurring
across
different
international
jurisdictions
2
some
persons
organized
outside
of
the
united
states
that
are
registered
with
the
commission
and
3
some
persons
that
typically
operate
both
within
and
outside
the
united
states
and
that
follow
substantially
similar
business
practices
wherever
located
where
the
commission
does
not
specifically
refer
to
matters
of
location
the
discussion
of
costs
and
benefits
below
refers
to
the
effects
of
the
proposed
rule
amendments
on
all
relevant
derivatives
activity
whether
based
on
their
actual
occurrence
in
the
united
states
or
on
their
connection
with
activities
in
or
effect
on
commerce
the
commission
identifies
and
considers
the
benefits
and
costs
of
the
proposed
amendments
relative
to
a
baseline
standard
of
those
generated
by
the
current
statutory
and
regulatory
framework
applicable
to
event
contracts
the
status
quo
this
framework
includes
the
provisions
involving
event
contracts
in
cea
section
and
current
and
commission
orders
that
have
been
issued
pursuant
to
which
address
relevant
terms
such
as
gaming
the
specific
elements
of
the
baseline
that
would
be
impacted
by
the
proposed
amendments
are
discussed

more

the
term

the
commission
has
issued
two

pursuant
to
the
nadex
order
see
and
the
kalshi
order
see
both
of
which
have
included
discussions
of

the
orders
have
provided
some
insight
regarding
the
commission
understanding
of
what
gaming
means
for
purposes
of
cea
section
and
for
example
the
orders
set
forth

that
i
relevant
state
and
federal
statutes
define
the
terms
gambling
betting
and

legislative
history
of
cea
section
indicates
that
the
relevant
question
for
the
commission
in
determining
whether
a
contract
involves
one
of
the
activities
enumerated
in
cea
section
is
whether
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
involves
one
of
those
activities
the
commission
understanding
of
the
term
gaming
as
set
forth
in
the
orders
that
it
has
issued
pursuant
to
is
reflected
in
its
proposed
definition
of
the
term
and
more
generally
in
the
other
amendments
proposed
herein
however
the
commission
recognizes
that
in
the
absence
to
date
of
a
formal
statutory
or
regulatory
definition
registered
entities
may
have
taken
somewhat
different
approaches
to
interpreting
the
scope
of
the
term
and
in
some
respects
may
have
interpreted
the
scope
to
be
narrower
than
the
definition
of
gaming
that
the
commission
is
now
proposing
conversely
certain
registered
entities
may
have
interpreted
the
term
more
broadly
than
the
commission
proposed
definition
the
commission
is
proposing
to
define
gaming
in
new
to
mean
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
the
commission
is
proposing
to
provide
in
new
that
gaming
includes
but
is
not
limited
to
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
including
an
election
or
elections
an
awards
contest
or
a
game
in
which
one
or
more
athletes
compete
or
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
in
establishing
the
proposed
gaming
definition
the
commission
as
noted
above
considered
its
discussion
of
gaming
in
the
nadex
order
and
kalshi
order
and
drew
upon
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
as
well
as
relevant
state
and
federal
statutory
definitions
see
note
54
supra
discussing
that
undefined
statutory
terms
are
given
their
ordinary
meaning
2
benefits
by
providing
additional
specificity
to
determine
whether
a
particular
event
contract
falls
within
the
scope
of
cea
section
and
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
it
involves
gaming
the
commission
believes
its
proposed
definition
would
reduce
the
likelihood
that
a
registered
entity
would
list
for
trading
an
event
contract
that
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
believes
that
by
establishing
a
common
understanding
and
more
uniform
application
of
the
term
gaming
the
proposed
definition
also
should
assist
registered
entities
in
their
product
design
and
compliance
efforts
and
help
avoid
situations
in
which
registered
entities
expend
resources
to
develop
and
submit
a
contract
that
the
commission
subsequently
determines
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
made
available
for
clearing
pursuant
to
cea
section
and
as
discussed
above
the
commission
has
observed
a
significant
increase
in
the
overall
number
and
diversity
of
event
contracts
being
listed
for
trading
see
section
supra
while
the
commission
does
not
have
access
to
data
or
any
other
information
to
enable
it
to
predict
the
specific
types
or
quantities
of
event
contracts
that
may
be
listed
for
trading
in
the
future
the
observed
event
contract
trend
causes
the
commission
to
anticipate
that
going
forward
absent
these
proposed
rule
amendments
the
number
of
submitted
contracts
involving
gaming
could
increase
accordingly
by
better
delineating
the
types
of
prohibited
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
the
proposed
definition
should
enhance
registered
entities
confidence
with
respect
to
product
design
and
compliance
potentially
yielding
and
resource
saving
benefits
for
them
in
the
process
in
addition
the
proposed
definition
may
help
guard
against
market
disruption
that
might
otherwise
be
caused
if
an
event
contract
is
listed
for
trading
and
the
commission
later
determines
following
an
individualized
review
pursuant
to
that
the
contract
is
prohibited
because
it
involves
gaming
and
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
proposed
definition
also
would
support
the
commission
and
its
staff
in
the
effective
oversight
of
derivative
markets
including
by
supporting
the
efficient
and
effective
administration
of
the
contract
submission
and
review
process
by
helping
to
reduce
the
likelihood
that
contracts
are
submitted
to
the
commission
that
raise
public
interest
concerns
in
this
regard
among
other
things
the
proposed
definition
would
promote
the
commission
responsible
stewardship
and
efficient
use
of
the
tax
dollars
appropriated
to
it
by
reducing
the

amendments
in
the
federal
register
and
have
settlement
dates
beyond
the
60
day
implementation
period
there
may
be
costs
to
the
listing
exchanges
and
market
participants
associated
with
the
wind
down
of
those
contracts
the
commission
notes
that
event
contracts
are
generally
based
upon
a
discrete
occurrence
or
event
and
commission
staff
anecdotal
experience
indicates
that
many
event
contracts
settle
within
relatively
short
time
horizons
this
coupled
with
the
fact
that
as
discussed
below
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
currently
comprise
a
small
portion
of
the
overall
event
contracts
market
suggests
that
few
event
contracts
involving
gaming
would
likely
need
to
be
wound
down
before
their
existing
settlement
dates
the
terms
and
conditions
of
event
contracts
listed
for
trading
as
of
the
issuance
of
these
proposed
rule
amendments
that
the
commission
believes
would
be
impacted
by
such
amendments
if
finalized
generally
establish
that
the
subject
contract
will
settle
either
on
a
date
that
is
expected
to
be
soon
after
the
contract
underlying
occurrence
or
event
or
as
a
backstop
on
a
date
that
is
further
in
the
future
typically
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
based
on
cftc
staff
experience
in
connection
with
administering
the
agency
product
review
process
the
commission
believes
notwithstanding
backstop
expiration
dates
most
event
contracts
settle
close
in
time
to
the
underlying
occurrence
or
event
with
respect
to
the
limited
number
of
contracts
that
the
commission
anticipates
would
have
settlement
dates
beyond
the
proposed
60
day
implementation
period
the
commission
expects
that
the
costs
to
exchanges
associated
with
orderly
wind
down
would
include
operational
compliance
and
technological
costs
as
further
noted
below
the
costs
to
exchanges
associated
with
the
wind
down
of
these
contracts
may
also
include
the
inability
to
realize
the
full
anticipated
return
on
investment
in
the
contracts
the
commission
notes
that
the
precise
costs
attributable
to
contract
wind
down
would
be
proprietary
information
of
the
listing
exchange
to
which
the
commission
does
not
have
access
however
given
the
limited
number
of
contracts
that
the
commission
anticipates
would
need
to
be
wound
down
before
their
existing
settlement
dates
the
commission
believes
that
these
costs
to
the
exchange
should
be
relatively
modest
the
commission
further
anticipates
that
certain
market
participants
may
incur
losses
depending
on
the
nature
of
their
positions
in
the
contracts
at
and
leading
up
to
wind
down
conversely
certain
market
participants
may
profit
based
on
the
nature
of
their
positions
at
and
leading
up
to
wind
down
the
commission
notes
that
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
would
be
impacted
by
this
proposed
rulemaking
if
finalized
tend
to
be
fully
collateralized
which
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
market
risk
to
which
market
participants
would
be
exposed
in
the
event
of
the
early
wind
down
of
such
a
contract
the
commission
notes
that
the
future
market
losses
or
gains
to
a
market
participant
are
not
predictable
with
any
data
and
therefore
the
commission
believes
that
it
is
not
feasible
to
further
quantify
these
costs
associated
with
potential
contract
wind
downs
the
commission
recognizes
that
a
further
consequence
for
certain
registered
entities
and
applicants
for
registration
of
establishing
a
common
understanding
and
more
uniform
application
of
the
term
gaming
may
be
to
modify
such
registered
entities
and
applicants
understanding
of
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
they
may
seek
to
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clearing
in
the
future
this
may
entail
certain
modifications
to
a
registered
entity
or
applicant
business
model
and
projected
revenue
streams
and
may
impact
a
registered
entity
or
applicant
ability
to
realize
the
full
anticipated
return
on
investment
with
respect
to
certain
aspects
of
its
business
model
for
example
a
registered
entity
or
applicant
for
registration
may
have
invested
resources
into
various
aspects
of
strategic
planning
market
research
technological
implementation
and
marketing
that
are
premised
at
least
in
part
on
event
contracts
that
may
be
implicated
by
the
proposed
gaming
definition
the
commission
notes
that
the
value
of
any
such
lost
return
would
be
proprietary
information
of
the
listing
registered
entity
to
which
the
commission
does
not
have
access
and
therefore
the
commission
believes
that
it
is
not
feasible
to
further
quantify
this
cost
associated
with
the
proposed
gaming
definition
relatedly
establishing
a
common
understanding
and
more
uniform
application
of
the
term
gaming
may
modify
in
certain
respects
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
are
available
to
market
participants
for
trading
and
clearing
in
this
regard
the
commission
notes
that
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be

comprise
a
small
portion
of
the
overall
event

market
suggesting
that
the
above
described
consequences
of
the
proposed
gaming
definition
would
be
relatively
modest
specifically
the
commission
estimates
that
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
comprised
less
than
1
of
the
total
trading
volume
in
event
contracts
in
2023
to
make
this
estimate
commission
staff
reviewed

that
was

to
the

by
cftc
registered

for
the
period
of
january
1
2023
through
december
31
2023
based
on
this
review
the
commission
further
estimates
that
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
comprised
approximately
6
of
the
total
number
of
event
contracts
listed
for
trading
in
2023
these
event
contracts
were
primarily
comprised
of
contracts
based
on
the
outcome
of
various
entertainment
awards
contests
in
2011
in
the
nadex
order
the
commission
recognized
certain
event
contracts
to
involve
gaming
where
taking
a
position
in
the
contracts
would
be
staking
something
of
value
upon
a
contest
of
others
nadex
order
at
3
as
previously
discussed
the
commission
notes
that
it
has
observed
a
significant
increase
in
the
number
and
diversity
of
event
contracts
listed
for
trading
by
cftc
registered
exchanges
as
well
as
increased
interest
among
applicants
and
prospective
applicants
for
exchange
registration
in
operating
exchanges
that
would
primarily
or
exclusively
offer
event
contracts
for
trading
this
upward
trend
if
it
continues
as
the
commission
anticipates
is
possible
if
not
could
extend
absent
the
proposed
rule
amendments
to
include
additional
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
an
extension
of
this
type
would
mean
that
a
registered
entity
or
applicant
for
registration
currently
may
have
plans
to
seek
to
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clearing
and
may
have
invested
in
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
beyond
this
general
observation
that
registered
entities
or
applicants
for
registration
potentially
could
have
plans
to
list
in
the
future
and
could
have
invested
in
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
the
commission
lacks
access
to
the

necessary
to

any

currently
could
have

in
the
future
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
in
the
commission
view
this
also
supports
the
benefits
as
discussed
infra
that
defining
the
term
would
provide
among
other
things
the
definition
would
enhance
confidence
regarding
product
compliance
that
can
inform
product
design
efforts
and
would
help
to
ensure
that
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
are
not
traded
on
cftc
regulated
markets
based
on
historical
trading
data
the
commission
recognizes
that
the
above
described
anticipated
costs
of
the
proposed
gaming
definition
may
have
more
of
an
impact
for
some
registered
entities
and
consequently
for
their
customers
than
others
in
2023
only
one
cftc
registered

defined
in
2023
only
one
cftc
registered
dco
cleared
event
contracts
that
involved
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
the
commission
expects
however
that
a
significant
proportion
of
these
registered
entities
offerings
would
not
be
impacted
by
the
proposed
gaming
definition
suggesting
that
the
overall
impact
to
these
registered
entities
of
the
proposed
definition
would
be
relatively
modest
for
example
the
commission
estimates
that
in
2023
event
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
comprised
approximately
1
of
the
trading
volume
of
the
cftc
registered
exchange
that
offered
such
contracts
for
trading
the
commission
further
estimates
that
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
comprised
approximately
9
of
the
total
number
of
event
contracts
listed
by
this
exchange
in
2023
to
make
these
estimates
commission
staff
reviewed

that
was
reported
to
the
commission
by
cftc
registered
exchanges
for
the
period
of
january

2023
through
december
31
2023
further
the
commission
believes
that
providing
specificity
to
determine
whether
a
particular
event
contract
involves
gaming
will
support
the
ability
of
these
and
other
registered
entities
to
develop
and
list
new
products
with
enhanced
confidence
regarding
such
products
compliance
with
the
cea
and
cftc
regulations
the
commission
believes
that
this
should
assist
registered
entities
as
well
as
applicants
for
registration
in
making
informed
business
decisions
with
respect
to
product
design
which
should
have
long
term
business
benefits
as
discussed
above
it
may
also
yield
business
efficiencies
for
registered
entities
by
helping
to
avoid
situations
where
they
expend
resources
to
develop
and
submit
a
contract
that
the
commission
subsequently
determines
following
a
review
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
to
that
end
the
commission
believes
that
defining
the
term
gaming
will
have
broader
public
benefits
by
helping
to
ensure
that
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
namely
certain
contracts
that
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
are
not
traded
including
by
retail
market
participants
as
financial
instruments
on
cftc
regulated
markets
b
amendments
to
further
align
with
statutory
language
the
proposed
rule
amendments
include
certain
changes
to
improve
regulatory
and
statutory
textual
alignment
that
are
not
expected
to
render
material
costs
or
benefits
by
further
aligning
the
regulatory
text
of
with
the
statutory
text
of
cea
section
the
proposed
amendments
may
be
of
some
limited
benefit
to
the
extent
any
registered
entity
would
unnecessarily
expend
resources
to
resolve
confusion
attributable
to
the
existing
textual
variation
first
when
describing
the
contracts
to
which
applies
the
commission
is
proposing
to
remove
the
terms

to
and
reference
wherever
they
appear
and
to
refer
only
to
contracts
that

or
as

that
may
involve
an
enumerated
activity
or

similar
activity
while
there
are
no
prescribed
similar

at
this

the
commission
retains
its
authority
under

section
and
to
prescribe
similar
activities
in
future
rules
or
regulations
in
order
to
further
align
with
the
statutory
text
of

section
the
commission
also
is
proposing
to
remove
from
the

to

section
and
to
more
precisely
track
the
statutory
language
of

when
describing
the
contracts
to
which
applies
while
accounting
for
the
errant
reference
to

which
is
not
a

in
the

by
stating
that
the

applies
with

factors
the
commission
has
evaluated
the
costs
and
benefits
of
the
proposed

five
broad
areas
of
market
and
public

the

believes
that
the
proposed

to
will
help
to
protect
the

by
preventing
the
listing
for
trading
or
acceptance
for
clearing
by
registered
entities
of
certain
event
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
further
believes
that
permitting
trading
of
contracts
involving
gaming
as
proposed
to
be
defined
would
conflate
gambling
and
financial
instruments
in
a
manner
that
could
particularly
create
confusion
and
risk
for
retail
market
participants
and
that
the
proposed
amendments
would
accordingly
enhance
protection
of
market
participants
b
efficiency
competitiveness

financial
integrity
of
markets
the
commission
acknowledges
that
a
consequence
for
certain
registered
entities
and
applicants
for

of
the
proposed
amendments
may
be
to
modify
such
registered
entities
and

that
they
may

the

anticipates
that
this

may
impact

more
than

estimates
that

the
