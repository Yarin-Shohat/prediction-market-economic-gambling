the
proposal
our
primary
interest
in
the
proposal
relates
to
the
commission
proposed
new
definition
of
gaming
and
the
categorical
proclamation
that
every
contract
involving
athletic
games
would
automatically
be
deemed
by
the
commission
to
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibited
from
being
listed
for
trading
or
clearing
on
a
registered
entity
eliminating
any
process
for
the
commission
to
review
or
analyze
the
potential
commercial
risk
management
utility
of
such
contracts
the
proposal
includes
an
unnecessarily
overbroad
definition
of
gaming
as
it
applies
to
athletic
games
that
is
i
inconsistent
with
the
commonly
understood
definition
of
event
contracts
ii
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent
and
iii
inconsistent
with
the
federal
and
state
regulation
of
sports
gambling
the
proposal
compounds
the
problems
with
its
overbroad
definition
by
applying
that
definition
to
declare
in
advance
that
entire
categories
of
event
contracts
including
those
involving
sports
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
therefore
automatically
disqualified
from
being
listed
thus
precluding
individual
consideration
of
the
specific
attributes
and
potential
commercial
utility
of
such
contracts
we
believe
that
to
the
extent
the
commission
has
a
concern
with
athletic
event
contracts
its
focus
and
rulemaking
should
properly
be
with
event
contracts
that
serve
as
a
proxy
for
a
pure
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
contest
for
example

however
there
are
potentially
many
types
of
innovative
contracts
involving
athletic
games
that
are
not
tied
to
the
outcome
of
a
single
game
or
multiple
games
and
that
have
the
potential
to
serve
a
real
economic
hedging

contracts
that
are
based
on
measures
that
comprise
multiple
performance
inputs
of
a
team
or
athlete
over
multiple
games
would
provide
significant
hedging
and
risk
management
benefits
to
numerous
industry
participants
who
are
exposed
to
economic
consequences
from
team
and
athlete
performance
these
contracts
would
be
based
on
continuously
priced
measures
that
reflect
team
and
player
performances
in
multiple
contests
as
opposed
to
the
kind
of
binary
payoffs
on
individual
contests
that
characterize
sports
gaming
as
commonly
understood
and
which
the
commission
seems
most
concerned
with
non
binary
sports
contracts
could
create
a
market
for
hedging
trading
and
investing
related
to
sports
economics
these
types
of
innovative
contracts
could
allow
sports
industry
participants
to
manage
their
financial
and
business
risks
which
are
impacted
by
athlete
and
team
performance
over
time
there
are
numerous
economic
risks
associated
with
professional
athlete
contracts
and
league
team
management
non
binary
sports
contracts
could
provide
price
discovery
and
an
opportunity
to
hedge
against
the
economic
impact
of
individual
athlete
risks
such
as
poor
performance
or
injury
and
league
and
team
risks
the
hedging
opportunity
is
beneficial
to
those
who
have
financial
exposure
to
or
wish
to
obtain
exposure
to
a
team
or
individual
athletes
including
sponsorship
endorsements
media
broadcast
rights
stadium
construction
and
operation
and
passive
franchise
owners
investors
such
contracts
could
provide
significant
hedging
and
risk
management
benefits
to
numerous
industry
participants
who
are
exposed
to
economic
consequences
from
team
and
athlete
performance
but
this
can
happen
only
if
the
commission
does
not
unnecessarily
include
such
contracts
within
an
overbroad
definition
of
gaming
that
would
automatically
disqualify
such
innovative
contracts
by
dismissing
them
categorically
and
preclude
the
consideration
of
their
economic
utility
on
a
contract
specific
basis
the
commercial
rationale
for
non
binary
sports
contracts
is
fundamentally
different
from
an
individual
using
binary
event
contracts
to
place
a
wager
on
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
event
which
is
what
constitutes
traditional
sports
betting
the
commission
should
not
lump
non
binary
sports
contracts
together
with
binary
event
contracts
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
is
unnecessarily
overbroad
is
inconsistent
with
the
longstanding
understanding
of
the
term

and
is
inconsistent
with
congressional

which

the

new

contract
provisions
currently
there
is
no
definition
of
the

in

the
cftc
proposes
to
amend
regulation
to
define
the
term
gaming
for
the
purpose
of
the
regulation
and
to
provide
that
any

would
automatically
be
disqualified
by
the
commission
from
being
listed
by
a
registered

thus
the
stakes
of
getting
the
definition
right
are
very
high
because
an
overly
broad
definition
will
result
in
the
disqualification
of
types
of

that
should
be
permitted

the
proposal
definition
of

is
overly
broad
is
inconsistent
with
the
longstanding
understanding
of
the

and
should
be
narrowed
to
refer
only
to
contracts
referencing
a

or
the
outcome
of

the
term
event
contract
is
not
defined
in
the
cea
or
the
cftc
regulations
however
event
contracts
have
been
generally
described
by
the
commission
to
be
a
type
of
derivative
contract
typically
producing
a
binary
payoff
structure
based
upon
the

of
an

or

in

that

the

may
be
properly
described
as
an
event
contract
because
in
both
cases
they
refer
to
the
outcome
of
a
single
game
and
it
might
be
appropriate
to
apply
the
definition
of

to
include
events
that
can
affect
the
outcome
of
a
game
or
the
performance
of
a
competitor
in
a
single
game
however
the
proposal
new
definition
of
gaming
goes
further
and
would
stretch
the
application
of
the
term
event
contracts
beyond
its
commonly
understood
meaning
to
include
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more

or
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one

more

and
would
also
include
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in

with
such

regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the

to
broadly
define

to
include
athletic
performance
across
multiple

every

non

of
whether
it
has
any
bearing

of

or
the

in

contradicts
the
plain
meaning
of

and
is
unnecessary
to
achieve
the
goals
that
the

is
seeking
to
achieve
the

not
include
contracts
that
are

definition

because
no

dictate
the
value
of
such
contracts
and
therefore
they
can
not
be
used
for
betting
on
the
outcome
of
a
game
the
commission
should
not
sweep
non
binary
sports
contracts
into
being
treated
as
event

through
an
unnecessarily
broad
definition
of

the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
goes
beyond
congressional
intent
and
could
capture
contracts
that
are
not
proxies
for
gambling
and
that
could
serve
a
bona

commercial
function
the
proposal
gaming
definition
goes
beyond
what
congress
intended
to
be
prohibited
although
the
reference
to

in

of
the

does
not
refer
to
sports
or
athletic

or
define
the
term

cites

a
colloquy
regarding
the

in

the
cited
colloquy
between
senators
blanche

regarding

refers
to
contracts
involving
singular
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky

and
masters
golf
tournament
this
suggests
that
contracts
involving
the
outcome
of
a
singular
game
constitute
activity
intended
to
be
restricted
from
trading
on
registered
entities
subject
to
a
public

determination
by
the
commission
lincoln
that
is
our
intent
the
commission
needs
the
power
to
and
should
prevent
derivatives
contracts
that
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
they
exist
predominantly
to
enable
gambling
through
supposed
event
contracts
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
these
types
of
contracts
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
used
solely
for
gambling
the
reference
to
singular
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
the
masters
golf
tournament
evidences
a
concern
with
listed
derivatives
contracts
that
would
mimic
traditional
bets
on
the
outcome
of
a
particular
sporting
event
in
other
words
binary
event
contracts
however
as
explained
above
because
the
proposed
definition
would
include
the
performance
of

more
competitors
in
one
or
more
games
or
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
games
the
proposal
expands
the
definition
of
gaming
well
beyond
the
scope
of
concern
described
in
the
colloquy
tellingly
the
proposal
does
not
mention
the
next
sentence
from
the
feinstein
lincoln
colloquy
which
sheds
further
light
on
the
intended
scope
of
the
prohibition
on

it

possible
to

this

we

that
any
unpredictable

that

the
proposal
purports
to
perform
such
an
analysis
proposal
at
48987
however
its
consideration
is
incomplete
and
that
underscores
one
of
the
flaws
of
its
categorical
preclusion
of
all
gaming
event
contracts
the
proposal
consideration
of
costs
and
benefits
does
not
include
an
evaluation
of
the
potential
price
discovery
and
risk
management
benefits
of
non
binary
sports
contracts
nor
does
it
evaluate
the
costs
of
the
loss
of
such
benefits
that
would
result
from
its
categorical
prohibition
of
such
contracts
from
being
listed
to
change
its
event
contract
review
process
as
the
commission
now
proposes
such
that
the
commission
would
make
a
categorical
determination
regarding
all
contracts
involving
an
enumerated
activity
such
as
gaming
involving
sports
events
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
policy
congress
did
not
provide
that
event
contracts
involving
enumerated
activities
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
per
se
rather
if
an
event
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
the
commission
may
determine
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
and
prohibited
from
trading
under
cea
section
congress
delegated
the
authority
to
the
commission
to
make
event
contract
public
interest
determinations
on
a
case
by
case
basis
for
contracts
that
involve
an
enumerated
activity
it
did
not
delegate
the
authority
to
make
categorical
prohibitions
historically
only
congress
has
exercised
the
power
to
ban
categories
of
contracts
outright
congress
has
invoked
this
power
very
rarely
in
the
case
of
contracts
involving
onions
the
onion
futures
act
of
1958
banned
futures
trading
in
onions
the
prohibition
on
onion
futures
was
incorporated
in
the

the
commodity

commission
act
of
1974

it
is
also
bad
policy
for
the
commission
to
make
pre
emptive
broad
categorical
determinations
as
to
enumerated
event
contracts
as
illustrated
in
this
letter
there
can
be
various
types
of
athletic
event
contracts
some
of
which
are
binary
event
contracts
based
on
the
outcome
of
a
game
some
that
are
based
on
multiple
events
or
metrics
and
some
that
are
yet
to
be
developed
to
categorically
treat
all
athletic
event
contracts
in
the
same
way
without
conducting
a
fact
specific
analysis
of
the
economic
utility
of
each
contract
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
promoting
responsible
financial
innovation
which
is
one
of
the
purposes
of
cftc
regulation
specified
under
the
cea
section
of
the
cea
the
supreme
court
decision
in
2018
overturning
paspa
and
the
continued
trend
of
states
liberalizing
the
regulation
of
sports
betting
occurred
after
the
adoption
of
dodd
frank
and
the
adoption
of
section
of
the
cea
and
regulation
most
states
have
since
legalized
sports
betting
in
some
form
the
proposal
fails
to
take
these
recent
legal
and
societal
trends
and
developments
into
its
consideration
of
its
legal
and
public
interest
analysis
and
instead
appears
to
want
to
find
that
gaming
as
very
broadly
defined
in
the
proposal
is
per
se
against
the
public
interest
without
having
to
make
a
contract
specific
analysis
when
in
fact
the
developing
trend
is
to
permit
certain
types
of
sports
betting
to
be
clear
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
commission
should
permit
event
contracts
that
can
operate
as
a
means
for
betting
on
the
outcome
of
an
athletic
game
but
in
seeking
to
prohibit
such
contracts
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
commission
to
also
disqualify
innovative
athletic
contracts
that
can
serve
a
bona
fide
economic
risk
management
purpose
conclusion
we
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
provide
comments
on
the
proposal
we
are
concerned
that
the
proposal
overbroad
gaming
definition
and
the
predetermined
wholesale
categorical
declaration
of
ineligibility
as
to
gaming
contracts
if
adopted
would
prevent
legitimate
commercial
sports
event
contracts
from
being
available
to
registered
entities
participants
with
economic
exposure
to
the
sports
industry
and
market
participants
stifling
the
promotion
of
responsible
innovation
which
would
be
contrary
to
one
of
the
fundamental
purposes
of
the
commission
accordingly
the
commission
should
either
withdraw
the
proposal
or
recalibrate
its
approach
by
more
carefully
focusing
on
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
event
contracts
involving
gaming
and
being
especially
mindful
of
the
evolving
public
interest
reflected
in
the
strong
trend
of
state
liberalization
of
the
regulation
of
sports
betting
in
performing
its
public
interest
analysis
the
commission
should
continue
to
apply
its
historical
approach
of
conducting
individualized
analysis
of
contracts
submitted
by
registered
entities
and
in
the
case
of
sports
event
contracts
distinguishing
between
event
contracts
that
are
solely
a
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a
sports
game
or
contest
and
those
contracts
that
are
structured
to
serve
a
real
economic
purpose
we
look
forward
to
further
engagement
with
the
commission
on
these
important
issues
please
do
not
hesitate

undersigned

you

any
