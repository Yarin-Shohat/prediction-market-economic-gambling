the

removing

the

to

the

relate
to

reference
and
focus
solely
on
event
contracts
that
involve
an

in

that

one
of
the

activities
or
a
prescribed
similar
activity
by
focusing
on
contracts
that
involve
an

the
proposed
amendments
will
enhance
regulatory
precision
and
ensure
that
the
cftc
prohibition
authority
is
the
same
as
the
statutory
language
the
proposed
amendments
reaffirm
the
cftc
prohibition
authority
and
the
standard
of
review
applicable
to
event
contracts
under
this
alignment
with
the
statutory
text
of
cea
section
is
also
consistent
with
the
determinations
made
by
the
cftc
in
the
kalshi
order
and
the
nadex
order
which
evaluated
whether
the
event
contracts
in
question
involved
an

activity

the
proposed
changes
are
not
intended
to
alter
the
scope
of
the
cftc
prohibition
authority
or
the
nature
of
its
analysis
in
determining
whether
a
particular
event
contract
falls
within
the
ambit
of
cea
section
and
the
term
involve
is
not
defined
in
the
cea
so
the
cftc
applies
its
ordinary
meaning
definitions
of
involve
include
to
relate
to
or
affect
to
relate
closely
to
entail
or
to
have
as
an
essential
feature
or
consequence
see
proposed
rulemaking
at

this
interpretation
ensures
that
the
regulation
can
effectively
address
contracts
that
while
not
directly
based
on
an
enumerated
activity
still
bear
a
significant
connection
to
such
activities
the
full
text
of
cea
section
clarifies
that
a
contract
involves
more
than
just
its
underlying
event
where
the
cea
specifies
a
contract
underlying
it
uses
the
term
underlying
or
refers
to
what
the
contract
is
based
on
or
based
upon
cea
section
section
uses
both
based
upon
and
involve
showing
a
distinction
between
the
two
this
section
applies
to
agreements
contracts
transactions
or
swaps
in
excluded
commodities
based
upon
the
occurrence
extent
of
an
occurrence
or
contingency
meaning
the
contract
underlying
must
be
an

it
then
states
that
such

must
involve
an

similar
activity
in
this
context
based

refers
to

requiring
only
that
it
be
an

while

retains
its
broader
ordinary

as
a

the

this

the

would
change

are
as
a

against

and
therefore
can

in
the
past
the
cftc
has
reviewed
each
contract
individually
to
determine
its
impact
on
public
interest
if
the
proposed
rulemaking
is
approved
the
cftc
would
no
longer
need
to
review
each
contract
individually
but
would
simply
check
if
it
falls
into
one
of
the
banned
categories
this
approach
provides
much

clarity
it
will
also
significantly
reduce
the

the

to
include
the
predominant
use
of
contracts
by
speculators
rather
than
for
commercial
producers
or

or
commercial
hedging
purposes
is
a
crucial
guideline
the
recognition
that
certain
contracts
may
threaten
national
security
or
the

further
justifies
the
need
for
a
categorical
approach
in
prohibiting
such

moreover
the
cftc
will
consider
all
relevant
factors
in
evaluating
whether
a

category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the

and
no

it

that
these
additional

are
important
public

the
factors
informing

determination
and
the
weight
given
to

will
vary
depending
on

the

proposal
amends
to
include
a
determination
that
any

that
involves

as
defined
in
the
proposed
rulemaking
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
see
proposed
rulemaking
48981
the
proposed
rulemaking
states
that
the
economic
impact
of
events
related
to
contests
or
games
of
skill
or
chance
including
their
outcomes
is
generally
too
diffuse
and
unpredictable
to
result
in
direct
and
quantifiable
changes
in
the
prices
of
commodities
or
financial
assets
this
limits
if
not
eliminates
entirely
the
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
of
event
contracts
involving
such
occurrences
this
is
appropriate
because
it
highlights
the
speculative
nature
of
these
contracts
which
are
more
likely
to
be
used
for
gambling
rather
than
for
legitimate
hedging
or
price
discovery
purposes
the
cftc
view
that
these
contracts
are
traded
primarily
for
entertainment
with
participants
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
contest
or
game
is
clearly
correct
such
contracts
are
likely
to
be
used
predominantly
by
speculators
without
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
and
can
not
be
reasonably
expected
to
serve
as
effective
hedging
tools
even
though
some
individuals
or
entities
might
experience
more
direct
economic
consequences
from
specific
occurrences
in
contests
or
games
the
cftc
believes
that
this
group
is
small
compared
to
the
broader
universe
of
market
participants
including
retail
traders
who
are
most
likely
to
engage
in
these
contracts
for
entertainment
see
proposed
rulemaking
48982
this
distinction
is
crucial
for
maintaining
market
integrity
moreover
individuals
or
entities
with
a
direct
economic
stake
in
these
events
might
have
access
to
inside
information
or
influence
raising
concerns
about
market
manipulation
for
example
a
professional
athlete
or
coach
could
use
privileged
information
about
their
team
to
trade
event
contracts
or
manipulate
the
market
the
cftc
efforts
to
address
these
manipulation
risks
are
necessary
and
appropriate
also
contracts
classified
as
gaming
typically
lack
an
underlying
cash
market
with
bona
fide
economic
transactions
to
provide
reliable
price
information
instead
they
rely
on
unregulated
and
opaque
sources
increasing
the
risk
of
manipulation
and
decreasing
the
ability
of
exchanges
and
the
cftc
to
detect
such
activity
this
lack
of
transparency
and
regulation
is
a
significant
concern
allowing
such
contracts
on
cftc
regulated
markets
could
also
blur
the
lines
between
gambling
and
financial
instruments
potentially
misleading
retail
investors
about
the
nature
of
these
contracts
this
could
improperly
suggest
that
these
contracts
are
suitable
for
investment
purposes
or
that
derivative
markets
are
appropriate
venues
for
gambling
furthermore
gambling
in
the
united
states
is
overseen
by
state
regulators
with
specific
expertise
and
legal
frameworks
designed
to
address
gambling
related
risks
and

is
not

gaming
regulator
and
does
not
have
the
mandate

to

gambling
activities
the
cftc
should
not
expend

as
this

political

events
and
variables
intervene
between
a

control
of
congress
and
the

of
a
given
policy
with
economic

history
is
littered
with
innumerable
examples
of

however
genuine
being
utterly
meaningless
once
a
person
or
party
is
elected
or
in
control
of
one
or
both
houses
of
congress
as
the
old
saying
goes
too
many

mistake
majority
for
control
partisan
majorities
do
not
mean
control
and
neither
majorities
nor

mean
that
some

item
or

will
pass

opponents
of
the
proposed
rulemaking
may
attempt
to
prove
the
hedging
capabilities
of
political
event
contracts
by
citing
examples
of
what
they
may
contend
are
the
economic
consequences
of
elections
including
for
example
changes
in
stock
prices
experienced
by
renewable
energy
companies
tobacco
stocks
and
others
that
appear
to
have
been
correlated
with
election
outcomes
but
such
anecdotal
evidence
in
a
realm
so
fraught
with
complexity
and
an
abundance
of
possible
causes
is
undeserving
of
any
weight
moreover
political
event
contracts
are
not
valid
hedging
tools

like

and

demonstrates
that
politically
motivated
bets
are
at
best
misguided
and
at
worse
just
plain
wrong
for
example
despite
expectations
private
prison
stocks
did
not
perform
consistently
under
the
trump
administration
and
showed
unexpected
gains
during

term
similarly
energy
and
gun
stocks
did
not
align
with
anticipated
political
outcomes
indicating
that
presidential
policies
have
less
influence
on
specific
market
sectors
than
commonly
believed
this
unpredictability
provides
yet
more
evidence
that
political
event
contracts
are
unreliable
and
inappropriate
for
hedging
purposes
from
a
regulatory
perspective
the
cftc
mandate
is
to
oversee
commodity
and
derivatives
markets
making
sure
they
function
effectively
for
hedging
and
price
discovery
that
ensures
that
vitally
important
commodities
are
available
to
the
american
people
when
they
want
them
in
the
amounts
they
want
and
at
prices
that
reasonably
reflect
supply
and
demand
whether
the
cftc

that
job

or
poorly

from

and
coffee
at

bread
and
peanut
butter
in
lunch
sandwiches
gas
for
cars
and
trucks
cotton
for
shirts
and
skirts
and
sugar
in
almost
everything
in
contrast
political
event
contracts
offer
no
such
significant
hedging
benefits
and
do
not
contribute
to
price
discovery
instead
they
represent
speculative
gambling
that
falls
outside
the
cftc
regulatory
expertise
experience
and
purview
and
will
detract
the
cftc
from
its
primary
mission
by
focusing
on
commodities
that
impact
everyday
life
such
as
agricultural
products
and
energy
resources
the
cftc
can
continue
to
serve
and
protect
the
american
people
additionally
the
cftc
is
already
underfunded
and
struggling
to
fulfill
its
current
statutory
mandates
introducing
significant
new
and
unrelated
duties
such
as
overseeing
political
event
contracts
would
further
strain
its
limited
resources
this
shift
in
focus
goes
against
congressional
intent
and
undermines
the
agency
ability
to
regulate
essential
commodity
and
derivatives
markets
effectively
the
cftc
should
prioritize
its
existing
responsibilities
to
ensure
the
stability
and
integrity
of
markets
that
directly
affect
the
daily
lives
of

rather
than
diverting
attention

outside

political
event
contracts
would
threaten
election
integrity
the
proposed
rulemaking
correctly
categorized
political
event
contracts
as
event
contracts
contrary
to
the
public
interest
because
election
gambling
fundamentally
cheapens
the
sanctity
of
our
democratic
process
political
bets
change
the
motivations
behind
each
vote
replacing
political
convictions
with
financial
calculations
allowing
billionaires
to
wager
extraordinary
bets
while
simultaneously
contributing
to
a
specific
candidate
or
party
and
political
insiders
to
bet
on
elections
using
non
public
information
will
further
degrade
public
trust
in
the
electoral
process
elected
officials
rely
not
only
on
free
and
fair
elections
to
engender
faith
in
the
outcomes
of
elections
but
elections
are
the
foundation
of
american
democracy
gambling
on

would
create
very
powerful
incentives
for
bad
actors
or
even
those
just
looking
to
make
a
quick
buck
to
interfere
with

try

outside

for

it

false
