i
want
to
take
the
time
to
highlight
former
senator
blanche
lincoln
comment
it
is
important
in
particular
i
want
to
submit
for
comment
this
portion
of
her
comment
i
am
deeply
troubled
by
the
recent
proposal
put
forth
by
the
cftc
the
federal
agency
that
is
tasked
with
administering
the
cea
in
prohibiting
broad
categories
of
contracts
the
cftc
proposal
relies
heavily
on
a
2010
senate
colloquy
between
me
and
the
late
senator
feinstein
for
support
but
the
cftc
proposal
goes
well
beyond
what
we
intended
this
heavy
handed
proposal
to
ban
markets
rather
than
regulating
them
risks
undermining
the
core
principles
that
underpin
our
financial
markets
principles
we
strived
to
uphold
through
carefully
crafted
legislation
that
encourages
innovation
and
provides
consumer
protections
