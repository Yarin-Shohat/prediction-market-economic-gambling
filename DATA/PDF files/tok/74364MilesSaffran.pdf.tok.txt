dear
kirkpatrick
railbird
exchange
railbird
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
offer
its
comments
to
the
commission
on
the
recently
proposed
rule
regarding
event
contracts
railbird
is
a
current
applicant
for
dcm
registration
as
an
event
contract
market
therefore
this
proposed
rule
is
of
particular
interest
to
us
after
reviewing
and
carefully
considering
the
proposal
railbird
offers
comment
on
the
following
issues
1
the
definition
of
gaming
2
the
public
interest
consideration
3
appendix
e
and
4
the
specific
questions
asked
by
the
commission
1
the
definition
of
gaming
is
overly
broad
and
would
restrict
legitimate
contracts
from
being
listed
for
trading
we
would
like
to
thank
the
commission
for
its
attempt
to
clarify
the
terms
of
however
the
proposed
rule
goes
beyond
clarification
resulting
in
the
potential
prohibition
of
any
contract
that
bears
any
relation
to
a
sport
the
proposed
rule
included
in
the
proposal
definition
of
gaming
is
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
emphasis
added
while
we
understand
the
commission
belief
that
event
contracts
should
not
act
as
a
proxy
for
gambling
a
term
the
commission
interchanges
with
gaming
there
are
potential
event
contracts
that
may
involve
a
sporting
event
but
are
not
based
on
the
ultimate
outcome
of
a
game
the
commission
does
not
cite
any
existing
laws
to
establish
that
prong
iv
meets
current
laws
related
to
gaming
according
to
the
proposing
release
at
48975
the
first
three
examples
of
what
gaming
is
have
been
recognized
as
gambling
betting
or
wagering
under
relevant
state
and
federal
statutes
this
sentence
makes
clear
that
prong
iv
of
the
definition
has
not
been
recognized
as
gaming
even
if
the
prior
three
have
been
2
the
public
interest
consideration
prohibits
contracts
based
on
a
predetermined
finding
as
against
the
public
interest
based
on
their
subject
rather
than
on
a
review
of
their
actual
terms
creating
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
result
in
addition
to
an
overly
broad
definition
of
gaming
the
cftc
provides
no
analysis
as
to
why
all
contracts
that
involve
gaming
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
given
the
extreme
overbreadth
of
the
definition
of
gaming
the
cftc
conclusion
that
all
contracts
that
involve
gaming
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
particularly
concerning
the
cftc
has
not
reviewed
the
terms
of
contracts
or
assessed
the
hedging
utility
of
whole
classes
of
contracts
so
they
do
not
have
any
reasoned
basis
to
conclude
that
they
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
by
prohibiting
any
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
an
event
related
to
a
game
the
commission
forecloses
the
possibility
of
legitimate
hedging
opportunities
for
individuals
and
small
businesses
who
may
not
have
another
means
to
do
so
for
example
a
stadium
vendor
may
want
to
hedge
the
possibility
of
cancellation
or
lower
attendance
of
events
at
the
venue
where
it
does
business
under
the
proposed
rule
if
the
event
is
a
football
game
the
vendor
may
not
hedge
its
risk
but
that
same
vendor
may
hedge
the
same
risks
if
the
event
is
a
concert
similarly
weather
based
event
contracts
have
existed
for
many
years
under
the
proposed
rule
a
weather
contract
for
the
amount
of
snowfall
at
bills
stadium
would
be
prohibited
but
a
weather
contract
for
snowfall
totals
in
the
zip
code
14127
is
allowed
the
result
is
an
arbitrary
prohibition
of
an
otherwise
legitimate
contract
sports
is
a
multinational
multibillion
dollar
industry
affecting
a
wide
range
of
businesses
and
individuals
some
risks
for
participants
in
the
industry
may
relate
to
front
office
decisions
such
as
whether
an
organization
will
move
a
team
to
another
city
hotels
restaurants
and
municipalities
may
want
to
hedge
the
risk
of
a
team
either
leaving
or
moving
to
their
area
the
proposed
rule
potentially
removes
the
opportunity
to
hedge
this
risk
for
individuals
and
entities
such
as
those
described
above
a
traditional
futures
contract
based
on
a
referenced
price
is
not
possible
while
certain
types
of
insurance
exist
to
hedge
the
risk
of
the
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
of
events
such
policies
are
either
expensive
bespoke
solutions
or
as
with
the
case
of
business
interruption
insurance
have
so
many
exclusions
as
to
be
ineffective
the
commission
provides
no
factual
support
or
analysis
as
to
why
it
has
chosen
to
define
the
term
gaming
in
this
manner
to
illustrate
the
commission
offers
the
following
explanation
for
its
definition
of
gaming
the
commission
is
however
proposing
to
define
gaming
to
include
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
a
contingent
event
in
connection
with
a
game
or
contest
which
the
commission
believes
would
be
as
much
of
a
wager
or
bet
on
the
game
or
contest
as
staking
or
risking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
contest
would
be
conclusory
statements
such
as
this
can
not
support
a
rulemaking
they
need
to
be
informed
by
actual
analysis
3
the
commission
has
failed
to
provide
the
public
interest
factors
that
would
determine
whether
a
contract
would
be
considered
against
the
public
interest
the
commission
also
proposes
to
offer
illustrative
examples
of
its
public
interest
analysis
as
an
appendix
e
to
the
proposed
rule
however
the
commission
has
failed
to
provide
the
contents
of
this
appendix
and
has
no
plans
to
do
so
before
the
end
of
the
comment
period
as
a
result
railbird
can
not
provide
meaningful
comment
on
this
aspect
of
the
proposed
rule
4
railbird
responses
to
the
specific
questions
contained
in
the
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
on
the
following
pages
railbird
offers
its
comments
to
each
of
the
questions
posed
by
the
commission
we
hope
the
commission
will
seriously
consider
the
impact
and
unintended
consequences
of
this
rule
as
proposed
1
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
proposal
to
amend
to
remove
the
terms
relate
to
and
reference
wherever
they
appear
and
to
refer
in
the
regulation
only
to
event
contracts
that
involve
an
enumerated
activity
or
prescribed
similar
activity
involve
is
a
broad
and
vague
term
whereas
relate
to
and
reference
are
more
precise
the
terms
reference
rate
and
underlying
reference
are
common
in
the
futures
markets
involve
is
not
using
a
much
broader
vague
term
like
involve
will
only
lead
to
more
confusion
for
dcms
as
they
try
to
offer
innovative
contracts
that
their
participants
would
like
to
trade
2
are
there
examples
of
activities
that
would
constitute
gaming
that
may
fall
outside
of
the
proposed
definition
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
already
stretches
outside
of
its
logical
boundaries
in
an
attempt
to
shoehorn
certain
activities
in
the
rule
the
commission
is
proposing
a
definition
so
far
off
the
mark
as
to
be
illogical
3
are
there
other
types
of
votes
or
elections
that
the
commission
should
specifically
identify
for
clarity
in
the
illustrative
examples
in
proposed
what
types
of
other
votes
or
elections
should
be
identified
and
why
railbird
has
no
comment

should
the
availability
at
gaming
venues
of
bets
or
wagers
on
a
particular
contingency
occurrence
or
event
be
a
relevant
factor
in
the
commission
consideration
of
whether
an
event
contract
involving
that
contingency
occurrence
or
event
involves
gaming
for
the
purposes
of
these
factors
can
be
a
consideration
but
not
the
only
one
5
if
on
judicial
review
it
is
determined
that
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
does
not
involve
gaming
the
commission
may
consider
whether
that
activity
is
similar
to
gaming
is
staking
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
a
political
contest
similar
to
gaming
railbird
has
no
comment
6
the
commission
may
also
consider
whether
it
should
enumerate
contracts
involving
political
contests
or
some
subset
thereof
as
contracts
involving
a
similar
activity
to
any
one
or
more
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
under
cea
section
and
determine
that
contracts
involving
this
newly
enumerated
activity
of
political
contests
contracts
involving
a
similar
activity
to
any
one
or
more
of
war
terrorism
assassination
or
activity
that
is
unlawful
under
any
federal
or
state
law
if
so
should
the
commission
determine
such
contracts
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
railbird
has
no
comment
7
the
commission
requests
comment
as
to
whether
commenters
agree
with
the
commission
view
that
a
registered
entity
is
unlikely
to
seek
to
list
for
trading
or
accept
for
clearing
a
contract
that
involves
a
state
law
prohibiting
certain
activity
that
while
not
repealed
is
generally
considered
archaic
and
is
not
enforced
this
question
is
purely
hypothetical
we
can
not
speak
to
the
motivations
of
other
markets
8
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
discussion
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
for
purposes
of
cea
section
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
following
questions
should
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
be
considered
as
factors
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
why
or
why
not
deeming
an
entire
category
of
contracts
against
the
public
interest
absent
review
is
inappropriate
and
can
lead
to
the
prohibition
of
legitimate
contracts
with
that
being
said
hedging
or
price
utility
is
a
useful
tool
but
not
the
only
one
that
may
be
used
to
determine
the
public
interest
utility
of
a
contract
if
hedging
and
price
basing
utility
should
be
considered
as
factors
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
how
should
such
utility
be
assessed
it
may
be
assessed
by
determining
what
is
the
market
for
these
contracts
what
are
that
market
specific
risks
that
are
being
addressed
how
will
these
contracts
assist
this
market
in
its
risk
management
goals
are
there
factors
in
addition
to
those
described
herein
that
may
be
relevant
when
evaluating
whether
a
contract
or
category
of
contracts
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest
are
there
factors
the
commission
should
specifically
not
consider
why
or
why
not
the
commission
should
not
consider
the
time
and
workload
involved
in
performing
the
function
of
reviewing
contracts
in
the
same
way
exchanges
need
to
maintain
appropriate
staffing
levels
the
commission
should
also
maintain
sufficient
staff
to
serve
the
markets
it
regulates

the

on
all
aspects
of
its
proposed
public
interest
determinations
with
respect
to
contracts
involving
terrorism
assassination

war
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
whether

that

contracts
that
could
conceivably
be
seen
as
gaming
in
the
proposed

rule
that

are
those
that
are
peripheral
to
the

these

the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
its
proposed
technical
amendments
to
as
stated
above
replacing
relate

reference
with
involve
would
only
serve
to
make
the
rule
more
vague
12
the
commission
requests
comment
on
all
aspects
of
the
proposed
implementation
timeline
in
particular
the
commission
requests
comment
on
the
following
questions
would
an
effective
date
that
is
30
days
after
publication
of
the
final
rule
amendments
in
the
federal
register
provide
registered
entities
with
sufficient
opportunity
to
comply
with
the
amendments
railbird
has
no
comment
would
the
proposed
60
day
implementation
period
provide
sufficient
time
for
the
expiration
of
or
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
listed
event
contracts
that
were
impacted
by
the
proposed
rule
amendment
railbird

no
comment
railbird
thanks
the
commission
for
the
opportunity
to
share
our
review
in
relation
to
the
proposed
event
contract
rulemaking
we
hope
that
in
considering
the
public
comments
the
commission
will
not
sacrifice
innovation
for
the
sake
of
expediency
