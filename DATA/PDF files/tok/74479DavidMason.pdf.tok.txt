is

a
pre

conclusion
the
portions
of
the
nprm
addressing
election
contracts
appear
to
be
an
exercise
in
attempting
to
justify
a
pre
determined
conclusion
the
evidence
of
this
disposition
is
widespread
and
varied
and
includes
the
chair
repeated
comments
made
in
congressional
hearings
and
industry
fora
about
the
intent
to
prohibit
election
markets
the
failure
to
hold
roundtables
or
use
other
methods
of
gaining
regulated
entity
input
ordinarily
used
by
the
cftc
in
making
regulatory
and
policy
decisions
the
rush
to
issue
a
proposed

without
the
important
appendix
e
the
failure
to
address
and
benefit
from
the
voluminous
comments
on
election
contracts
submitted
in
two
recent
kalshi
proceedings
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
review
or
attempt
to
derive
lessons
from
its
32
year
history
of
allowing
experimental
election
markets
at
iowa
election
markets
and
predictit
the
exclusive
focus
on
negative
factors
in
the
public

discussion
the
failure
to
consider
alternatives
to
a
ban
such
as
position
and
participant
limits
the
strained

stretched
definition
of

that
betrays
result
oriented
reasoning
several
of
these
failures
are
addressed
in
more
detail
below
but
the
combination
of
these
factors
displays
a
prejudice
that
warrants
scrapping
the
current

and
initiating
a
more
deliberative
and
reasoned
approach
to

the
heavy
reliance

the

for

of

and
for

this
lack
of

fatally
wounds
both
the
cftc
proposed
expansive
definition
of

and
its
effort
to
read
the
public

enunciated
by
congress
narrowly
by
attempting
to
revive
the
repealed

test
these
flaws
touch
several
specific
elements
of
the
proposal
and
are
sufficiently
thoroughgoing
that
the
commission
should
withdraw
the
nprm
so
heavily
dependent
on
such
unreliable
authority
and
reexamine
its
approach
failure
to
examine
or
draw
lessons
from
relevant
commission
approved
markets
for
32
years
the
commission
has
allowed
iowa
electronic
markets
to
operate
under
a
no
action
letter
offering
event
contracts
on
us
and
non
us
elections
that
period
is
well
over
half
of
the
entire
time
the
cftc
has
existed
for
ten
years
victoria
university
of
wellington
has
operated
the
predictit
market
offering
event
contracts
on
elections
and
until
the
cftc
objected
related
topics
a

ticker
of

statistics
is
available
on
the

predictit

are

cited
in
the
financial
media
presumably
a
major
point
of
allowing
experimental
academic
research
markets
under
no
action
letters
nals
is
to
draw
lessons
from
those
markets
iem
and
predictit
trading
statistics
have
been
widely
used
in
academic
studies
the
commission
had
an
event
contract
rulemaking
on
its
unified
regulatory
agenda
for
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
prior
to
issuance
of
this
nprm
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
nprm
that
the
commission
made
even
a
cursory
effort
to
understand
and
draw
lessons
from
these
commission
approved
efforts
both
markets
are
mentioned
but
relegated
to
footnotes
no
actual
experience
related
to
the
markets
is
mentioned
the
nprm
speculates
about
potential
market
abuses
but
failed
to
examine
actual
market
experience
the
nprm
speculates
about
harms
but
ignores
the
demonstrated
public
benefits
of
these
and
other
prediction
markets
it
is
pertinent
to
note
relative
to
the
speculative
harms
to
elections
conjured
by
the
commission
that
the
uk
ireland
and
australia
all
with
political
economic
and
social
systems
similar
to
the
us
have
permitted
regulated
financial
speculation
on
elections
for
decades
without
substantial
problems
in
no
other
area
of
policy
would
the
commission
consider
proceeding
to
an
nprm
without
first
gathering
input
from
markets
and
market
participants
already
engaged
in
the
areas
to
be
affected
by
the
proposed
regulations
as
noted
at
the
outset
this
striking
incuriosity
about
event
markets
the
commission
approved
and
allowed
to
operate
for
over
three
decades
gives
the
strong
appearance
that
the
outcome
of
the
rulemaking
was
pre
decided
and
that
evidence
was
optional
and
perhaps
welcome
only
when
it
fit
the
conclusion
the
commission
should
suspend
the
current
nprm
and
return
to
the
drawing
board
to
examine
the
experience
beneficial
or
harmful
of
the
election
prediction
markets
the
commission
allowed
to
operate
for
such
extended
periods
elections
are
not
games
and
election
contracts
are
not
gaming
the
commission
entire
effort
to
ban
election
contracts
can
be
boiled
down
to
the
argument
that
elections
are
contests
and
contests
are
gaming
this
argument
is
a
glaring
example
of
the
logical
fallacy
of
equivocation
using
a
key
word
or
phrase
in
an
ambiguous
way
i
rather
have
a
ham
sandwich
than
eternal
happiness
because
nothing
is
better
than
eternal
happiness
and
a
ham
sandwich
is
better
than
nothing
the
effort
also
rests
on
a
stretched
and
selective
choice
of
definitions
from
state
gaming
law
that
is
further
evidence
of
outcome
based
reasoning
political
contests
are
often
referred
to
even
in
legal
contexts
to
as
campaigns
see
the
federal
election
the
term
campaign
was
converted
from
military
to
political
use
and
indeed
the
term
is
still
used
to
describe
both
political
and
military
contests
that
dual
usage
does
not
however
convert
elections
into
battles
though
that
term
is
also
used
in
both
political
and
military
contexts
or
wars
subject
to
the
prohibition
of
cea
by
that
logic
taking
speculative
positions
in
futures
contracts
would
be
prohibited
since
doing
so
is
often
referred
to
as
a
bet
the
proposed
rule
definition
of
gaming
is
both
overbroad
and
under
inclusive
and
its
use
of
the
definition
to
ban
election
contracts
is
inappropriate
the
cftc
proposal
would
prohibit
contracts
that
relate
to
a
a
contest
of
others
and
it
specifies
that
contracts
relating
to
the
outcome
of
elections
would
be
prohibited
under
this
proposed
rule
the
commission
must
recognize
that
its
proposed
definition
of
gaming
threatens
to
swallow
up
the
entire
category
of
event
contracts
this
definition
also
ignores
a
critical
component
of
the
word
gaming
which
is
its
nexus
with
events
that
can
reasonably
be
classified
as
games
elections
are
not
games
and
the
cftc
attempt
to
classify
them
as
such
ignores
the
very
significant
real
world
effects
of
their
results
in
the
absence
of
a
definition
of
gaming
in
the
cea
or
federal
law
the
cftc
refers
to
state
law
definitions
of
gaming
or
gambling
the
most
common
definition
of
gaming
under
state
law
involves
wagering
money
on
a
future
contingent
event
not
under
the
control
of
the
participants
to
the
wager
the
cftc
rejects
this
most
common
definition
however
because
it
obviously
would
swallow
up
every
futures
contract
ever
written
the
commission
then
latches
on
to
a
less
common
state
law
definition
involving
contests
and
applies
it
as
if
there
were
no
legal
or
logical
distinction
between
elections
and
an
effort
to
guess
how
many
jellybeans
are
in
a
large
glass
jar
the
selection
of
the
second
best
state
law
definition
is
more
evidence
of
the
outcome
based
reasoning
underlying
the
nprm
and
even
if
we
accept
the
second
best
state
law
definition
of
gaming
the
equivocal
use
of
the
term
contest
fatally
undermines
the
commission
proposed
application
elections
are
not
contests
at
all
properly
understood
and
elections
are
certainly
not
contests
within
the
meaning
of
any
state
gaming
law

in
state

are

between

a

thus
elections

even
remotely
within

regulated
by

proof
of
this
proposition
lies
in
the

that
outlaws
wagering

reads
that

none

have
realized

on

already
covered

on

or
might
the

rest

of

could

at

the
exchange
would
also
note
that
the
cftc
based
its
2023
rejection
of
kalshi
proposed
contracts
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
media
sometimes
uses
the
word
contest
in
connection
with
the
underlying
of
the
proposed
contracts
kalshi
order
at

the
exchange
would
reasonably
conclude
that
pharmaceutical
manufacturers
are
engaged
in
contests
against
their
competitors
to
sell
medications
and
acquire
market
share
a
drug
manufacturer
such
as
ozempic
producer
novo
nordisk
would
certainly
describe
itself
as
being
engaged
in
a
struggle
for
superiority
in
market
share
against
competitors
like
mounjaro
producer
eli
lilly
both
of
these
companies
and
products
are
further
engaged
in
competition
against
traditional
weight
loss
programs
offered
by
companies
like
weight
watchers
and
noom
the
exchange
would
have
to
conclude
that
it
could
not
offer
this
contract
the
exchange
would
similarly
have
to
shelve
its
plans
to
offer
a
contract
on
whether
a
corporate
ceo
would
remain
in
office
because
the
ceo
could
reasonably
be
described
as
being
in
competition
with
rival
candidates
for
his
position
a
contract
on
a
corporate
merger
would
also
be
off
the
table
because
corporations
frequently
make
competing
offers
and
use
buyouts
to
build
market
share
and
battle
for
supremacy
in
the
marketplace
the
exchange
would
then
have
to
conclude
that
the
proposed
rule
prohibits
contracts
on
us
semiconductor
production
growth
because
the
united
states
and
china
are
often
described
in
media
as
being
in
a
competition
or
battle
for
supremacy
over
the
production
of
these
chips
phase
a
contract
on
advancements
in
artificial
intelligence
would
similarly
be
imperiled
because
it
relates
directly
to
competition
between
different
tech
companies
and
nation
states
the
cftc
through
its
proposed
rule
may
not
have
intended
to
ban
these
types
of
contracts
the
cftc
overtly
wanted
to
ban
contracts
relating
to
elections
and
awards
shows
but
for
unclear
reasons
the
cftc
chose
to
do
so
by
promulgating
an
overbroad
definition
of
gaming
whereby
any
event
contract
that
could
reasonably
be
described
as
involving
a
contest
and
that
is
not
explicitly
defined
as
being
an
economic
indicator
would
be
prohibited
the
plain
text
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
including
the
choice
of
the
word
gaming
makes
it
clear
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit

the

that
the

has
repeatedly
and
misleadingly
cited

shows
an
intent
to

that
are

the

that

and

intended

that

comment
of

per

not
the

or
the

of

these

are
nothing
like
the
super

the
kentucky

or
the
masters
tournament
if
we
had
intended
to
include
these
events
we
would
have
done
so
explicitly
the
cftc
now
knows
that
it
is
interpreting
the
statute
using
a
piece
of
legislative
history
in
direct
opposition
to
the
intent
of
the
relevant
legislators
the
proposed
rule
must
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
the
clarification
by
senator
lincoln
the
plain
text
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
including
the
choice
of
the
word
gaming
makes
it
clear
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit

on

the

that
the

such
as

and

this
proposed
rule
strays
too
far
from
this
intent
the
cftc
is
correct
to
argue
that
it
needs
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
contracts
that
would
be
functionally
indistinguishable
from
sports
gambling
a
dcm
could
for
example
propose
a
contract
on
which
city
would
host
a
game
of
the
major
league
baseball
mlb
world
series
because
mlb
games
are
typically
played
in
one
of
the
stadiums
of
a
competing
team
this
contract
would
correlate
directly
with
the
winner
of
the
league
playoff
rounds
that
immediately
precede
the
world
series
the
cftc
would
be
correct
to
determine
that
this
contract
involves
gaming
under
17
cfr
the
notion
though
that
the
congressional
prohibition
on
contracts
that
relate
to
gaming
could
possibly
have
been
intended
to
sweep
up
any
event
contract
that
can
reasonably
be
tied
to
a
competition
is
ludicrous
the
cftc
has
provided
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
congress
intended
to
use
the
word
gaming
in
a
way
that
prohibited
contracts
on
medication
prescriptions
semiconductor
production
corporate
actions
or
scientific
advancements
congress
also
did
not
use
the
word
gaming
to
refer
to
elections
in
response
to
the
nprm
specific
request
for
comment
on
the
possibility
of
regulating
election
contracts
as
similar
to
gaming
for
essentially
these
same
reasons
the
commission
may
not
use
the
similar
activities
category
to
expand
the
definition
of
gaming
the
commission
clearly
began
at
a
conclusion
that
it
wanted
to
ban
election
contracts
via
rulemaking
and
built
this
definition
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion
the
commission
must
address
the
unintended
consequences
of
this
broad
definition
and
either
propose
a
narrower
definition
of
gaming
one
that
recognizes
that
gaming
involves
games
or
scrap
this
proposed
rule
the
nprm
unbounded
definition
of
the
term
involve
as
a
daisy
chain
to
regulate
any
activity
that
can
be
connected
to
an

activity

impermissibly

section
of
the
nprm
asks
for
comment
on
the
commission
proposal
to
remove
the
terms

from
section
retaining
only
the
statutory
term
involve
we
agree
that
revising
the
regulations
to
track
the
statute
more
directly
is
beneficial
the
commission
however
appears
to
be
engaging
in
a
subterfuge
by
arguing
that
involve
should
be
defined
as
including
activities
that
relate
to
or
affect
enumerated
activities
removing
relate
to
from
the
regulatory
text
and
reinserting
it
via
a
definition
of
involve
that
will
not
be
published
in
the
cfr
is
worse
than
no
change
at
all
because
it
offers
the
appearance
of
closer
adherence
to
the
statutory
text
while
masking
the
reality
of
continuing
to
adhere
to
an
impermissibly
broad
interpretation
of
the

the
cftc
errs
in
limiting
its

what

in

is
a
rigorous
examination
of
the
link
required
for
one
activity

action
to

the

this

the

this

elections

elections
are
real
world
events
with

some
of
these

are
clear

while

may
take

to
understand
this
is
in
dramatic
contrast
to
games
which
using
the
ordinary
dictionary
definition
of
the

fundamentally
relate
to

the
commission

fails
to
address
this
clear
and
obvious
distinction
between
elections
and

though
the
commission
has
articulated
a
rationale
however
weak
in
its

and
kalshi
orders
in
those
orders
the
cftc
characterized
the
link
between

as
diffuse

and
inaccurately
claimed

the

are

significant
enough

and
the
prospect

caused

this
stands
in
contrast
with
france
where
political
fragmentation
contributed
to
a
decision
by

to
downgrade
french

bonds
french

were

an

although

for

international
markets

moved
in
direct
response
to
2024
election
results
in
india
taiwan

among
others
these
markets
did
not
need
to
wait
for
the
new
governments
to
pass
legislation
or
even
to
be
sworn
in
they
did
not
just
move
on
the
winners
of
the
elections
but
they
also
moved
on
the
margins
of
victory
and
the
number
of

won
by
particular
parties
in
some
countries
such
as
france

viewed

favorably
and
fell
or
rose
based
on
the
size
or
existence
of
the
governing
majority
in

such
as
mexico
markets
would
have
preferred
to
see
more
gridlock
because
they
oppose
the
policies
proposed
by
the
election
winners
these
real
world
examples
refute
the
cftc
claim
that
the
economic
effects
of
elections
are
too
diffuse
or
unpredictable
to
provide
legitimate
hedging
value
and
the
cftc
is
in
error
to
ban
contracts
on
these
elections
proposed
rule
at
48976
another
critical
distinction
between
election
futures
and
gaming
markets
is
the
liquid
nature
of
the
contracts
prediction
market
positions
are
tradeable
until
the
date
of
settlement
on
both
predictit
and
kalshi
traders
who
purchase
shares
at
one
price
are
free
to
sell
shares
prior
to
the
resolution
of
the
market
in
predictit
market
asking
about
partisan
control
over
congress
following
the
2022
midterm
elections
for
example
68
percent
of
shares
purchased
over
the
life
of
the
market
were
sold
at
least
once
prior
to
the
settlement
of
the
market
in
the
equivalent
2020
market
80
percent
of
shares
were
sold
at
least
once
prior
to
settlement
contrast
this
with
the
typical
all
or
nothing
structure
of
a
gambling
bet
once
a
gambling
bet
is
made
there
is
no
secondary
market
where
a
participant
can
exit
the
bet
while
the
final
payout
structures
in
gaming
and
prediction
markets
are
similar
all
to
the
correct
side
and
nothing
to
the
incorrect
side
the
free
tradability
of
prediction
market
positions
prior
to
settlement
makes
the
uses
and
behavior
of
prediction
market
positions
quite
different
from
gaming
on
predictit
typical
traders
do
not
buy
and
hold
shares
to
the
payout
date
for
an
all
or
nothing
result
but
instead
make
an
investment
observe
a
profit
or
loss
and
exit
the
market
via
a
trade
with
a
payout
of
some
amount
other
than
the
binary
0
or
1
similar
behavior
is
evident
in
non
binary
futures
markets
where
many
traders
take
and
then
exit
positions
before
settlement
dates
another
key
difference
between
gaming
and
event
contracts
particularly
those
on
elections
is
the
public
benefit
generated
by
event
contract
prices
the
data
produced
by
these
contracts
is
valuable
and
its
availability
is
greatly
in

the
cftc
is
erroneously
trying
to
lump
election

in
with
contracts
on
the
super

or
kentucky

without
considering
that
those
events
unlike

are
conducted
for
entertainment
and
sport
elections
are
conducted
precisely
because
of
the
consequences
that
flow
from
them
the
cftc
must
use
a
definition
of
gaming
that
maintains
its
connection
with
games
and
must
not
lump
election
contracts
in
with
gaming
and
gambling
elections
are
not
a
contest
of
others
the
cftc
is
also
in
error
when
it
includes
election
outcomes
within
the
category
of
contests
of
others
this
phrase
implies
a
scenario
like
in
a
sporting
match
in
which
an
individual
trading
on
the
outcome
is
a
mere
observer
rather
than
an
active
participant
this
description
does
not
accurately
describe
an
election
because
voting
is
an
act
of
direct
participation
in
the
outcome
the
cftc
has
already
demonstrated
that
it
understands
this
through
its
concern
that
a
voter
would
switch
their
vote
in
order
to
influence
the
outcome
of
an
election
through
this
concern
the

the

recognizes
that

define
gaming
through
reference
to
outcomes
that
are
dependent
on

this
is
in

where
traders
generally
are

to
trade
based
on
informed
and

election

are
much
more
like

during

the

do
deep
research

analysis
on
the
relevant

and
the

before

the

that
election

are
not
games
of

and
are
not

at
all
election
contracts
are
in
the
public
interest
if
the
cftc
finds
that
a
proposed
contract
involves
one
of
the
enumerated
categories
it
is
required
by
the
statute
to
proceed
to
an
analysis
of
whether
the
proposed
contracts
are
within
the
public
interest
7
in
this
rulemaking
the
commission
is
proposing
to
categorically
determine
that
contracts
that
fit
within
its
overbroad
definition
of
gaming
are
outside
of
the
public
interest
this
subversion
of
the
congressionally
mandated
process
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
the
cftc
is
determining
that
proposed
contracts
that
do
not
yet
exist
are
against
the
public
interest
without
having
done
any
fact
finding
and
without
having
provided
any
explanation
of
its
reasoning
this
determination
shirks
the
cftc
responsibility
to
review
contracts
on
an
individual
basis
and
it
is
flat
out
wrong
the
commission
can
not
shirk
its

simply
by

generate

the
general

has
already
demonstrated
a

in
these

this

then
repeatedly
changes
over

as

digest

these

continuously
reflect

apply
to

due
to

the

that

is
also

the

the

by

whether

are
able

the

could
easily
mitigate

relating

by
for

limiting

significantly
decreasing
the
possibility
that

will
have
any

the

public

falls
short

required
to
do
under
the

of

that

failure

represents
a

flaw
in

it
is
a

maxim

all
of
the

even
higher
limits
might
be
justified
in

the

widely

to
prevent

limit
the
potential
for

abuse
rather

the

should
seek
comment
on
whether
a
combination
of
position
limits
and
other
standard
regulatory
tools
such
as
categorical
participant
exclusions
can
allow
us
to
reap
the

while
limiting
or
eliminating
possible
harms
this
failure
to
consider
the
use
of
standard
regulatory
tools
to
prevent
supposed
harms
is
yet
more
evidence
that
the
commission
is
interested
in
advancing
a
pre
determined
outcome
rather
than
understanding
the
actual
risks
and
benefits
of
these
markets
the
cftc
is
discriminating
against
retail
investors
in
an
unjustified
manner
and
fails
to
understand
that
retail
traders
are
key
to

the

repeatedly
emphasizes
that
the

is
concerned
about
retail

participating

the
only
explanation
that
the

provides
is

it
risks

the

in
that
context
the
most
natural
reading
of
the
unlawful

any
federal

state

category
is
that
it
is
intended
to
cover
categories
such
as
murder
or
more
general
crime
rates
this
category
can
not
be
stretched
as
the
commission
suggests
to
leapfrog
via
the
term
involve
to
the
act
of
taking
a
future
or
option
position
on
a
matter
because
most
futures
and
options
contracts
are
illegal
under
the
laws
of
most
states
the
operative
provision
of
refers
to
contracts
on
a
contingency
wagering
on
a
future
contingent
event
is
unlawful
under
most
state
laws
the
commission
can
not
logically
read
a
provision
that
allows
contracts
on
certain
contingencies
as
having
a
rule
swallowing
exception
that
prohibits
taking
a
financial
position
wager
on
contingencies
nor
can
the
commission
logically
read
a
general
unlawful
under
federal

state

provision
as
secretly
targeted
specifically
to
elections
and
awards
shows
but
allowing
wager
type
activity
on
weather
or
any
other

that
is
also
illegal
under
many
state

the
cftc
treatment
of
kalshi
proposed
election
contracts
which
the
cftc
should
not
extend
is
inconsistent
with
the
cftc
treatment
of
other

the
cftc
order
claims
that
the
use

that
cftc
can
prohibit
both
contracts
whose
underlying
purpose
is
one
of
the
enumerated
activities
and
contracts
with
a
different
connection
to
one
of
the

because
for

they

the

cites
several

define

as

to
taking
a
stake
on
the

the

that

for
the
cftc
the
fact
that
an
election
is
a

in

can

fails
to

with
the
fact
that
its
disapproval

differs
from

the

the

advances
in

the

arbitrary

if
the
cftc
were
serious
about
its
interpretation
of
the
legal
standard
articulated
in

order
and
extended
it
elsewhere
it
would
undermine
the
rationale
for
every
market
regulated

as
nearly
all

may
in
some
way
involve
gaming
or
risk
overlapping

nowhere
in

does
the
cftc
address
the
sweeping
consequences
of
the
order
interpretation
of
the
act
nor
does
the
cftc
attempt
to
reconcile
this
interpretation
with
decisions
it
has
made
and
contracts
it
has
allowed
in
the
past
the
cftc
order
fails
to
adequately
explain
how
it
is
that
kalshi
proposed
contracts
involve
violations
of
state
laws
but
other
contracts
offered
on
dcms
do
not
both
of
these
shortcomings
define
the

the

must
provide
the

with
a

that
it

consistently

no
arbitrarily
apply

it
has
not
done
so
election

do
not
involve
and
are
not
similar
to

the
cftc
is
considering
whether
it
should
codify
a
view
that
election

that

here
the
cftc
is
determining
that
proposed
contracts
that
do
not
yet
exist
are
against
the
public
interest
without
having
done
any
fact
finding
and
without
having
provided
any
explanation
of
its
reasoning
this
is
manifestly
contrary
to
the
statute
consider
for
example
a
dcm
that
intends
after
the
implementation
of
this
proposed
rule
to
list
a
contract
asking
if
a
new
country
will
join
a
defense
pact
like
nato
or
an
arms
procurement
partnership
like
aukus
the
cftc
could
reasonably
determine
that
these
contracts
involve
war
the
cftc
would
then
state
that
it
has
determined
that
these
contracts
are
against
the
public
interest
and
that
the
contract
can
not
be
listed
the
fundamental
problem
for
the
cftc
though
is
that
the
cftc
never
actually
made
such
a
determination
the
cftc
never
did
any
fact

never
provided
any
reasoning
and
never
gave
the
dcm
the
opportunity
to
argue
to
the
contrary
the
cftc
did
provide
some
rationale
albeit
inadequate
for
its
conclusion
that
election
contracts
are
against
the
public
interest
but
it
provided
none
whatsoever
for
its
conclusion
that
the
nato
or
aukus
contracts
are
against
the
public

this
is
the
definition
of
arbitrary

capricious
to
determine

whatever

it

foreign

has

as
has
been
noted
in
the

the
cftc
concerns
about

can
be
mitigated
by
creating
a
framework
that
distinguishes
between
contract
manipulation
and

similar
to
the

distinguishing
between

investor
relation
practices
and
business
practices
see
for
example
to
the
extent
that
the
cftc
has
reasonable
concerns
about
creating
perverse
incentives
it
can
resolve
these
through
a
position
limits
b
restrictions
on

based
on
small

elections
or

that
would
prohibit

with

trillions
of

decisions
already
flow
directly
from

a
cftc

especially
with
reasonable
position

could
not
create
new

for

that
do
not
already

position

in

are
an
apt
tool
for
protecting
against
the
threat
even
if
only
imagined
of
large
derivative
positions
affecting

or
providing
incentives
for

the
cftc
and

use

concerns
the
cftc
failure
even
to
ask
about
how
this
common
and
widely
used
tool
might
address

concerns
is
further
evidence
that
the
cftc
came
to
this

with
a
pre

rather

informative
comment
on
the
issues
surrounding
election
event
contracts
the
proposed
rule
will
be
circumvented
easily
in
many
cases
commenters
must
speculate
about
likely
behavioral
reactions
to
proposed
rules
in
the
case
of
a
rule
banning
election
contracts
we
need
not
speculate
wealthy
firms
and
individuals
will
be
able
to
evade
the
rule
perfectly
legally
and
anyone
willing
to
use
widely
available
internet
tools
will
be
able
to
evade
the
ban
easily
this
is
already
occurring

what
the

does

is
that

will
occur

forgoing

this

a
worst

approach

positions
on

election
outcomes
but
where
us
regulators
will
have
zero
oversight
or

of
the

the
cftc
should
consider
the
proven
ease
of
circumvention
of
their
election
contract
ban
and
recalibrate
its
approach
to
embrace
sound
us
based
regulation
of
these
markets
given
the
undeniable
reality
that
election
related
contracts
already
exist

are

the
cftc
suggestion
that
banning
such

in
a
regulated
environment
in

will
somehow
protect
the

of
our

is
both
naive

deficiencies
separation
of

reading
the
undefined
statutory
term
gaming
to
include
event
contracts
on
electoral
outcomes
likely
goes
so
far
beyond
any
commonsense
understanding
of
that
word
that
the
commission
would
be
engaging
in
legislation
via
rulemaking
the
separation
of
powers
principles
upon
which
our
government
is
founded
do
not
allow
an
agency
of
the
executive
branch
to
exercise
the
power
of
the
legislative
branch
not
only
is
the
legislative
executive
divide
implicated
so
too
is
the

the

just
overturned

the
commission
should
not
expect
any
judicial
deference
in
defining
elections
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
boxing
match
or
a
spinning
roulette
wheel
economic
liberty
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
requires
government
action
to
satisfy
basic
standards
of
rationality
courts
interpret
this
obligation
as
having
two
components
1
the
government
must
have
a
legitimate
interest
at
stake
and
2
there
must
be
a
rational
fit
between
that
legitimate
interest
and
the
means
the
government
has
chosen
to
pursue
it
here
it
is
not
clear
that
the
commission
as
a
futures
market
regulator
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
restricting
event
contracts
based
on
philosophical
objections
that
such
contracts
will
injure
the
sanctity
or
dignity
of
democracy
nor
is
there
a
rational
fit
even
if
the
commission
has
a
role
in
policing
elections
a
dubious
proposition
as
discussed
above
there
is
no
plausible
evidence
that
event
contracts
in
electoral
outcomes
can
alter
those
electoral
outcomes
in
a
way
the
commission
should
care
about
the
notion
that
such
contracts
will
unravel
democracy
something
that
has
happened
in
any
jurisdiction
where
such
contracts
are
allowed
is
the
sort
of
fantasy
thinking
that
courts
reject
as
a
valid
constitutional
basis
for
economic
regulation
defining
gaming
to
include
elections
violates
the
separation
of
powers
in
two
ways
legislative
executive
line
congress
did
not
define
gaming
as
the
supreme
court
has
long
said
when
the
statutory
language
is
plain
we
must
enforce
it
according
to
its
terms

defines
gaming
as
the
practice
or
activity
of
playing
games
for
stakes
the
commonsense
understanding
of
playing
games
for
stakes
is
what
happens
in
las
vegas
such
as
betting
on
horses
or
sporting
events
or
games
of
chance
like
roulette
wheels
the
purpose
of
the
term
gaming
is
to
prevent
a
cftc
regulated
entity
from
becoming
a
de
facto
casino
the
cftc
could
not
therefore

but
an
election
is
not
a
casino
game
of
chance
or
sporting
event
that
reality
can
not
be
evaded
by
defining
gaming
as
a
contest
of
others
because
that
sweeps
in
vast
amounts
of
economic
activity
whether
ford
or
tesla
will
sell
the
most
electric
sedans
is
a
contest
of
others
once
the
commission
decides
that
it
can
prohibit
anything
that
can
be
described
as
a
contest
of
others
then
the
cftc
can
arbitrarily
pick
and
choose
according
to
its
own
internal
criteria
of
what
is
valuable
and
what
is
not
but
that
is
quintessentially
a
legislative
determination
this
is
especially
evident
in
the
policy
justifications
that
the
proposed
amendment
cites
the
perception
of
election
integrity
monetary
incentives
to
vote
for
particular
candidates
even
when
such
votes
may
be
contrary
to
a
voter
or
organized
group
of
voters
political
views
false
reporting
or
other
misinformation
about
elections
and
the
specter
of
investigating
the
outcome
of
an
election
itself
congress
could
have
but
did
not
define
gaming
in
the
expansive
manner
the
draft
amendment
proposes
and
congress
did
not
do
that
despite
the
longstanding
existence
of
the
iowa
electronic
market
for
example
or
election
contracts
in
foreign
jurisdictions
had
congress
perceived
event
contracts
in
electoral
outcomes
to
be
dangerous
and
members
of
congress
of
course
understand
the
electoral
process
and
its
stakes
then
congress
would
have
supplied
the
expansive
definition
of
gaming
that
the
commission
now
proposes
in
short
expanding
the
definition
of
gaming
beyond
its
commonsense
dictionary
meaning
and
doing
so
for
policy
reasons
that
are

first
it
is
not
clear
the
proposed
amendment
proffered
justifications
for
prohibiting
event
contracts
in
electoral
outcomes
are
grounded
in
legitimate
interests
for
example
the
concern
about
misinformation
or
inauthentic
voter
choices
is
fundamentally
a
concern
about
political
speech
and
voting
the
government
has
essentially
no
power
to
regulate
the
content
of
political
speech
and
so
logically
it
is
not
clear
the
commission
has
any
legitimate
interest
in
prohibiting
event
contracts
based
on
concerns
about
misinformation
in
political
speech
any
attempt
to
ban
politically
related
activity
due
to
government
concern
about
the
content
of
related
political
speech
would
clearly
violate
the
first
amendment
similarly
the
commission
professed
concern
with
voters
being
incentivized
to
vote
against
their
interest
is
a
core
personal
choice
protected
by
a
secret
ballot
and
subject
to
a
dizzying
array
of
incentives
financial
or
otherwise
so
too
of
concerns
about
how
markets
may
affect
the
outcome
of
elections
event
contracts
about
elections
may
affect
outcomes
by
supplying
voters
with
useful
information
about
the
relative
strength
of
candidates
at
any
given
moment
in
that
regard
event
contracts
produce
useful
information
to
supplement
polling
and
political
commentary
the
commission
has
no
legitimate
interest
in
squelching
information
sources
on
the
theory
that
they
may
affect
elections
because
the
whole
point
of
information
is
to
affect
election
outcomes
indeed
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
the
first
amendment
has
particular
application
in
the
context
of
elections
see
generally
buckley
valeo

us

1976
and
its
progeny
the
last
thing
we
want
is
the
commission
deciding
what
information
is
good
or
bad
when
it
comes
to
elections
the
obvious
solution
is
to
allow
event
contracts
on
election
results
not
ban
them
second
whatever
legitimate
interest
may
be
at
stake
there
is
no
rational
relationship
between
those
interests
and
a
blanket
ban
on
event
contracts
in
electoral
outcomes
to
the
contrary
the
proposed
amendment
justifications
for
such
a
ban
seem
like
fantasy
there
is
no
evidence
for
example
that
small
scale
markets
such
as
the
iowa
electronic
market
or
predictit
or
such
markets
in
overseas
jurisdictions
have
resulted
in
information
manipulation
or
elections
coming
out
differently
in
a
way
the
cftc
should
care
about
as
just
discussed
one
valuable
effect
of
event
contracts
in
elections
is
that
they
produce
useful
information
for
voters
that
may
affect
electoral
outcomes
and
that
is
a
good
thing
the
notion
that
more
and
better
information
will
result
in
some
sinister
consequence
for
democracy
and
that
the
commission
must
protect
us
from
that
dark
future
is
an
overwrought
fantasy
economic
regulation
premised
on
sheer
fantasy
is
unconstitutional
conclusion
this
nprm
is
fatally
compromised
it
shows
strong
evidence
of
being
crafted
to
support
a
pre
determined
conclusion
it
ignores
readily
available
evidence
it
wholly
disregards
voluminous
comments
regarding
the
benefits
of
event
markets
it
fails
to
consider
commonly
employed
alternatives
short
of
a
sweeping
ban
it
employs
fallacious
reasoning
in
attempting
to
contort
inapt
state
law
definitions
to
cover
elections
it
attempts
to
resurrect
a
repealed
statutory
test
by
means
of
a
never
spoken
post
passage
colloquy
it
seeks
to
take
a
historically
dramatic
step
without
serious
engagement
with
affected
markets
and
market
participants
it
fails
to
engage
with
the
voluminous
academic
literature
on
the
benefits
of
event
markets
it
seeks
to
abdicate
or
delegate
to
staff
important
regulatory
functions
committed
to
the
commission
it
ignores
the
notorious
operation
of
offshore
markets
offering
us
election
contracts
that
are
functionality
available
to
us
residents
the
commission
should
withdraw
the
current
nprm
and
re
engage
with
advocates
as
well
as
critics
of
event
markets
in
order
to
gain
a
better
understanding
of
the
functions
operations
and
benefits
of
these
markets
with
the
objective
of
crafting
a
regulatory
approach
to
address
actual
rather
than
merely
imagined
harms
while
reaping
the
benefits
of
these
markets
