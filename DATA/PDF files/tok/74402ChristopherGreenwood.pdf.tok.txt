aristotle
is
contesting
the

and
views
the
precipitous
effort
to
end
the

as
unfortunate
unnecessary
and

the

as

the
lessons

the

with

shows
that
there
is
huge
interest
among
american
voters
and
investors
in
political
prediction
markets
that
there
is
tremendous
social
and
economic
value
in
those
markets
commission
question
1
the
proposed
contracts
do
not
constitute
gaming
as
referenced
in
commission
regulations
and
the
commodity
exchange
act
before
addressing
statutory
and
regulatory
definitions
of
gaming
there
is
an
obvious
and
critical
distinction
between
binary
prediction
markets
as
operated
by
predictit
and
kalshi
and
gaming
prediction
market
positions
are
tradeable
gaming
bets
and
wagers
generally
are
not
while
the
final
payout
structures
in
gaming
and
prediction
markets
are
similar
all
to
the
correct
side
and
nothing
to
the
incorrect
side
the
free
tradability
of
prediction
market
positions
prior
to
close
makes
the
uses
and
behavior
of
prediction
market
positions
quite
different
from
gaming
to
take
one
example
from
predictit
in
the
2020
presidential
market
there
were
shares
purchased
of
that
total
over
61
were
sold
before
expiration
the
typical
trader
in
that
market
did
not
buy
and
hold
shares
to
the
payout
date
for
an
all
or
nothing
result
but
instead
made
an
investment
observed
a
profit
or
loss
and
exited
the
market
via
a
trade
with
a
payout
of
some
amount
other
than
the
binary
0
or
1
similar
behavior
is
evident
in
nonbinary
futures
markets
where
many
traders
take
and
then
exit
positions
before
settlement
dates
free
tradability
and
the
ability
to
exit
positions
prior
to
the
triggering
event
is
such
a
fundamental
distinction
from
ordinary
gaming
that
parsing
of
the
meaning
of
whether
a
binary
prediction
contract
to
gaming
seems
unnecessary
but
we
believe
that
a
correct
reading
of
the
statute
especially
in
light
of
the
development
of
trade
practices
since
2012
also
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
binary
prediction
contracts
such
as
those
proposed
by
kalshi
are
not
gaming
nor
do
they
relate
to
gaming
commission
regulation
prohibits
contracts
that
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
in
its
nadex
order
the
commission
rejected
the
common
sense
reading
that
the
underlying
commodity
behind
the
contracts
needed
to
be
based
upon
the
outcome
of
a
game
such
as
cards
or
football
to
fall
within
the
prohibition
and
stated
that
allowing
the
contracts
would
be
akin
to
allowing
gambling
on
elections
per
the
nadex
order
elections
themselves
were
not
gaming
but
the
act
of
investing
in
the
proposed
contracts
on
elections
constituted
impermissible
gaming
this
of
course
is
the
same
economically
uninformed
argument
that
has
been
made
against
commodity
markets
from
their
inception
similar
arguments
could
be
made
regarding
any
contract
on
an
event
that
lacks
underlying
cash
value
but
the
commission
has
approved
or
allowed
hundreds
of
such
contracts
consider
several
contracts
that
are
currently
or
have
recently
been
hosted
on
kalshi
on
this
exchange
traders
can
speculate
as
to
the
temperature
in

event

one
would
struggle
to
come
up
with
a
definition
of
gaming
that
excludes
questions
about
future
weather
events
or
the
academy
awards
but
includes
the
composite
outcome
of
the
midterm
elections
the
nadex
order
cited
the
unlawful
internet
gambling
enforcement
act
to
argue
that
the
terms
bet
and
wager
can
be
defined
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
31
5361
even
if
one
accepts
that
those
terms
are
equivalent
to
the
term
gaming
this
definition
can
not
be
read
to
be
consistent
with
the
current
regulatory
environment
both
the
outcome
of
the
academy
awards
and
the
passage
of
legislation
clearly
constitute
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
event
markets
are
also
distinguishable
from
gaming
because
event
markets
serve
an
economic
purpose
traditional
gaming
provides
a
venue
for
participants
to
place
a
bet
on
the
outcome
of
a
sports
contest
or
other
event
and
its
primary
and
ultimate
purpose
is
to
benefit
the
trading
participants
and
the
operator
of
the
venue
who
is
the
counterparty
to
the

election

the

asks
a

of
questions
related
to

with
only
the
fifth
of
those
questions
referring
to

as
discussed
below
we
believe
that
political
event
contracts
have
hedging
utility
while
hedging
is
the
most
commonly
cited
economic
purpose
of
commodities

this
series
of
questions
suggests
an
unreasonably
narrow
view
of
economic

restricted
to

in
the
case
of
political
prediction
markets
the
social
utility
of
the
market
is
the
information
generated
on
the
likelihood
of
a
particular
political
outcome
investors
the
news
media
political
actors
and
citizens
are
all
intensely
interested
in
advance
predictions
of
election
outcomes
as
evidenced
by
the
great
interest
in
polling
and
political
modeling
as
well
as
by
extensive
media
punditry
some
of
that
interest
is
directly
related
to
likely
economic
impacts
of
election
results
but
much
of
that
interest
is
related
to
citizens
stakes
in
their
own
government
and
the
commission
should
not
dismiss
that
interest
simply
because
it
is
not
hedging
activity
because
prediction
markets
have
been
shown
to
produce
more
accurate
forecasts
than
polling
pundits
or
election
models
the
commission
should
recognize
that
there
is
an
economic
purpose
in
well
functioning
election
prediction
markets
regardless
of
the
amount
of
hedging
carried
on
in
those
markets
generally
or
in
particular
products
however
designed
or
marketed
consider
for
example
that
in
the

up

on

nights
predictit
receives
many
times
more
visitors
than
the
number
of
users
actively
trading
on

there
is
a
great
deal
of
interest
among
individuals
many
of
whom
find
it
difficult
and
confusing
to
understand
partial
election
returns
as
they
come
in
in
using
event
markets
to
determine
which
candidates
have
an
edge
at
any
given
time
in
this
sense
event
contracts
provide
a
similar
service
to
that
of
traditional
news
media
who
offer
election
night
programing
featuring

explaining
the
meaning

proposed
contracts
serve
the
public
interest
as
outlined
in
the
background
section
above
the
strong
investor
media
and
academic
interest
in
political
prediction
markets
demonstrates
that
these
markets
are
in
the
public
interest
the
commission
statutory
test
is
to
determine
that
proposed
markets
are
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
test
is
stated
as
a
double
negative
because
of
a
presumption
that
the
primary
purpose
of
most
markets
is
to
serve
private
interests
which
is
permissible
so
long
as
that
activity
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
in
the
case
of
political
prediction
markets
however
the
public
interest
served
is
arguably
at
least
as
important
as
the
private
interests
involved
the
public
benefits
from
reliable
accurate
widely
available
and
transparent
information
about
likely
political
developments
far
more
directly
than
the
public
generally
benefits
from
similar
information
about
future
economic
developments
the
possibility
that
the
yield
curve
is
inverted
as
important
as
that
indicator
is
is
of
intense
interest
to
a
limited
set
of
investors
but
of
little
note
to
most
americans
the
possibility
that
party
control
of
congress
is
likely
to
switch
is
of
great
interest
to
most
americans
in
the
case
of
these
contracts
the
relatively
small
proportion
of

likely
to
invest

the

raised
concerns
that
political

had
the
potential
to
affect
the
integrity
of

among
other
concerns
the
commission
speculated
that
positions
in
prediction
markets
might
give
voters
a
financial
incentive
to
support
candidates
they
otherwise
would
oppose
the
speculation
is
undermined
by
the
observed
behavior
of
partisans
in
the
predictit
market
what
we
see
on
predictit
is
that
individuals
bring
their
political
dispositions
into
the
market
rather
than
exporting
their
profit
incentives
into
their
voting
behavior
the
willingness
of
partisans
to
wager

of
their
preferred
candidates
is

it
is
self
evident
that
the
individuals
who
will
choose
to
trade
on
these

will
simply
not
have
the
ability
to
significantly
affect
their
overall
outcomes
although
the
commission
may
have
reasons
to
be
concerned
about
contracts
that
relate

local

the

the

question
about
whether

would
make
it
easier
for
political
action
committees
to
sidestep
rules
limiting
or
prohibiting
coordination
with
candidate
campaign
committees
appears
to
be
based
on
a
lack
of
understanding
about
those
rules
and
how
they
work
in
practice
those

allowing
the
proposed
contracts
to

on

will
reduce
their
susceptibility
to
insider
trading
and
manipulation
the
commission
is
concerned
that
political
event
contracts
are
susceptible
to
manipulation
via
insider
trading
by
individuals
with
access
to
information
that
is
not
readily
available
to
the
public
the
possibility
that
individuals
or
groups
may
trade
on
internal
non
public
polling
data
is
itself
a
reason
why
the
commission
should
approve
these
contracts
the
kalshi
rulebook
in
compliance
with
federal
laws
and
regulations
explicitly
prohibits
any
individual
defined
as
an
insider
who
is
in
a
position
to
have
material
nonpublic
information
from
trading
on
a
contract
that
relates
to
said
information
rule
there
is
almost
nothing
however
from
stopping
that
same
individual
from
trading
a
comparable
contract
on
an
unregulated
exchange
event
markets
operating
with
regulatory
supervision
are
thus
in
a
better
position
to
police
the
manipulation
of
markets
by
insider
trading
than
the
unregulated
offshore
exchanges
such
as
polymarket
that
currently
serve
as
liquid
exchanges
that
host
a
significant
share
of
these
trades
bringing
these
trades
onto
federally
regulated
markets
would
mitigate
the
issues
that
the
commission
is
expressing
concern
over
the
commission
question
poses
a
classic
insider
trading
scenario
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
insider
trading
by
campaign
staff
poses
any
greater
threat
than
insider
trading
by
corporate
insiders
and
the
same
rules

tools
can
be
