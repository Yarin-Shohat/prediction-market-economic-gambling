as

below
we
have
concerns
about
certain
aspects
of
the
rulemaking
particularly
the
60
day
implementation
period
during
which
registered
entities
will
need
to
wind
down
any
contracts

several
of
these
contracts
may
be
impacted
by
the
proposal
the
commission
explains
that
the
proposal
aims
to
provide
registered
entities
with
additional
clarity
regarding
the
types
of
event
contracts
that
are
prohibited
under
the
commodity

act
cea
thereby

proposal
89
fed
reg
at
48969
although
the
proposal
discusses
the
effect
of
the
proposed
amendments
on
registered
entities
generally
it
does
not
consider
that
a
final
rule
will
necessarily
impact
exchanges
and
clearinghouses
differently
for
example
exchanges
will
naturally
focus
on
initial
contract
design
and
listing
decisions
whereas
clearinghouses
will
focus
on
identifying
all
open
positions
covered
by
the
final
rule
that
must
be
wound
down
accordingly
miaxdx
has
concentrated
its
comments
below
on
the
unique
impacts
a
final
rule
would
have
on
clearinghouses
in
particular
miaxdx
comments
address
challenges
clearinghouses
will
face
with
respect
to
the
identification
and
orderly
wind
down
of
covered
contracts
and
recommend
several
changes
to
the
proposal
that
would
facilitate
that
process
ii
proposal
registered
entities
making
good
faith
efforts
to
wind
down
inscope
contracts
should
not
be
subject
to
a
60
day
implementation
period
for
the
reasons
outlined
below
miaxdx
respectfully
submits
that
60
days
is
not
sufficient
time
for
registered
entities
to
i
identify
all
contracts
impacted
by
any
final
rule
and
ii
arrange
for
an
orderly
cessation
of
their
trading
instead
registered
entities
working
in
good
faith
to
comply
expeditiously
with
any
final
rule
should
not
be
subject
to
an
arbitrary
final
date
by
which
all
contracts
must
be
de
listed
and
settled
rather
any
deadline
should
be
tailored
to
the
settlement
dates
of
contracts
already
trading
or
being
cleared
through
a
particular
exchange
or
clearinghouse
at
the
time
a
final
rule
is
adopted
the
proposal
provides
a
60
day
implementation
period
after
the
final
rule
is
published
in
the
federal
register
proposal
89
fed
reg
at
48995
during
this
implementation
period
registered
entities
must
oversee
the
expiration
of
or
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
all
listed
event
contracts
that
are
impacted
by
the
final
rule
i
d
in
explaining
why
this
60
day
implementation
period
is
appropriate
the
commission
asserted
that
i
many
event
contracts
settle
within
relatively
short
time
horizons
and
ii
event
contracts
that
involve
gaming
currently
comprise
a
small
portion
of
the
overall
event
contracts
market
that
few
event
contracts
impacted
by
the
proposed
rule
amendments
if
finalized
would
need
to
be
wound
down
before
their
existing
settlement
dates
i
d
additionally
the
commission
noted
that
it
believed
the
60
day
implementation
period
would
provide
sufficient
time
for
the
registered
entity
to
ensure
the
orderly
cessation
of
trading
in
any
longer
dated
contracts
i
d
based
upon
our
preliminary
analysis
of
contracts
currently
listed
for
trading
and
clearing
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
commission
assessment
that
few
contracts
are
implicated
by
the
proposal
miaxdx
believes
there
are
potentially
hundreds
of
contracts
currently
listed
for
trading
on
dcms
or
sefs
that
could
be
implicated
by
the
final
definition
of
gaming
for
example
there
are
dozens
of
event
contracts
currently
trading
based
on
television
movie
and
song
rankings
nominations
and
outcomes
of
award
shows
rankings
of
artificial
intelligence
programs
outcomes
of
ongoing
litigation
outcomes
related
to
sports
and
outcomes
associated
with
corporate
events
all
of
which
appear
to
fall
within
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
as
either
contests
games
or
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
for
example
there
are
contracts
currently
listed
for
trading
on

this

in
addition
although
the
commission
is
correct
that
many
event
contracts
have
short
time
horizons
that
is
not
universally
the
case
various
event
contracts
are
either
long
dated
settlement
dates
in
2025
or
have
an
indeterminate
settlement
date
based
on
the
outcome
of
future
events
outcome
of
litigation
for
example
a
new
microsoft
ceo
before
2026
contract
settles
by
december
31
2025
the
settlement
of
an
award
show
contract
is
necessarily
tied
to
the
date
of
the
show
with
the
grammys
currently
scheduled
for
february
2025
and
the
oscars
currently
scheduled
for
march
2025
and
litigation
contracts
often
settle
upon
the
date
of
any
settlement
or
final
decision
by
a
court
further
as
detailed
below
it
is
impossible
for
a
registered
entity
to
know
with
certainty
which
event
contracts
fall
within
the
scope
of
any
final
rule
depending
upon
the
final
definitions
adopted
as
well
as
any
guidance
in
the
preamble
it
is
possible
that
additional
contracts
may
come
into
scope
while
other
contracts
may
be
excluded
in
the
proposal
the
commission
noted
that
it
expected
registered
entities
to
make
good
faith
efforts
that
will
result
in
conformance
with
the
final
rule
amendments
by
no
later
than
the
effective
date
of
the
final
amendments
or
the
60
day
implementation
period
as
applicable
these
good
faith
efforts
should
take
the
final
rule
amendments
into
account
in
all
compliance
contract
design
and
listing
trading
or
clearing
decisions
as
well
as
in
decisions
leading
to
the
orderly
and
timely
winddown
of
any
contracts
with
settlement
dates
beyond
the
60
day
implementation
period
89
fed
reg
at
48985
in
order
to
begin
winding
down
covered
contracts
miaxdx
must
first
comprehensively
analyze
each
contract
to
determine
which
are
in
scope
moreover
because
the
boundaries
of
what
constitutes
a
game
or
contest
are
not
clear
under
the
proposed
gaming
definition
and
may
not
be
sufficiently
clarified
in
any
final
definition
in
many
cases
miaxdx
may
need
to
consult
the
commission
to
confirm
it
agrees
with
miaxdx
determination
in
addition
because
miaxdx
clears
event
contracts
for
an
unaffiliated
third
party
exchange
miaxdx
will
also
need
to
coordinate
with
this
dcm
regarding
contract
determinations
and
the
cessation
of
trading
in
scope
contracts
lastly
as
we
explain
further
below
there
are
significant
legal
operational
and
reputational
risks
to
miaxdx
and
other
registered
entities
if
they
incorrectly
conclude
that
a
particular
contract
is
either
in
scope
or
out
of
scope
from
the
rulemaking
for
all
of
these
reasons
miaxdx
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
eliminate
a
final
60
day
deadline
by
which
all
in
scope
contracts
must
be
de
listed
instead
we
respectfully
request
that
the
commission
provide
exchanges
and
clearinghouses
the
flexibility
and
time
they
need
to
analyze
each
contract
confer
with
the
commission
about
their
determinations
and
responsibly
wind
down
trading
and
clearing
of
in
scope
contracts
in
an
orderly
manner
the
commission
should
establish
a
process
by
which
registered
entities
can
receive
clarity
quickly
about
whether
a
contract
is
covered
by
the
final
rule
in
order
to
facilitate
implementation
of
any
final
rule
miaxdx
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
establish
a
process
by
which
exchanges
and
clearinghouses
can
engage
the
commission
to
resolve
open
implementation
questions
as
discussed
in
greater
detail
below
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
makes
it
impossible
for
registered
entities
to
determine
with
certainty
whether
many
event
contracts
are
either
in
scope
or
out
ofscope
given
the
significant
consequences
of
that
determination
to
both
registered
entities
and
market
participants
it
is
critical
that
there
be
a
process
for
registered
entities
including
clearinghouses
to
engage
with
the
commission
to
confirm
whether
particular
contracts
are
encompassed
by
the
proposal
miaxdx
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
establish
a
process
by
which
registered
entities
can
submit
a
list
of
contracts
along
with
their
preliminary
determinations
regarding
whether
they
are
or
out
of
scope
for
confirmation
by
the
division
of
market
oversight
and
the
division
of
clearing
and
risk
upon
confirmation
the
registered
entity
would
begin
the
process
of
winding
down
the
contracts
in
an
orderly
manner
the
absence
of
a
process
by
which
registered
entities
can
receive
clarity
from
the
commission
exposes
them
to
unnecessary
legal
reputational
operational
risk
because
of
the
significant
consequences
of
an
incorrect
determination
for
example
if
a
registered
entity
decides
in
good
faith
that
a
contract
is
not
covered
by
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
but
the
commission
subsequently
disagrees
the
registered
entity
may
not
only
be
subject
to
penalties
from
the
commission
but
it
is
also
unclear
whether
such
contracts
would
continue
to
enjoy
federal
preemption
from
applicable
state
gaming
laws
depending
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
a
clearinghouse
or
exchange
may
be
at
risk
of
being
the
subject
of
claims
or
investigations
arising
from
state
gaming
or
gambling
laws
whether
from
private
causes
of
action
or
state
or
local
authorities
while
we
would
expect
that
any
federally
regulated
exchange
or
clearinghouse
would
vigorously
defend
itself
against
any
such
allegations
this
potential
outcome
can
be
avoided
by
narrowing
the
definition
of
gaming
as
described
under
sections
and
below
on
the
other
hand
if
a
registered
entity
is
over
inclusive
and
determines
that
an
event
contract
is
encompassed
within
the
commission
definition
of
gaming
market
participants
may
be
unnecessarily
forced
to
close
out
their
lawful
positions
in
fact
the
same
registered
entity
may
simultaneously
be
both
and
under
inclusive
in
its
determinations
of
what
is
covered
by
the
commission
proposed
vague
definition
of
gaming
thereby
exposing
it
to
both
such
risks
given
the
significant
consequences
of
making
an
incorrect
determination
miaxdx
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
establish
a
process
by
which
registered
entities
may
obtain
legal
certainty
about
whether
a
contract
is
in
scope
before
they
are
required
to
take
actions
on
contracts
they
currently
clear
or
offer
for
trading
the
commission
should
limit
the
definition
of
gaming
to
those
activities
commonly
understood
to
be
gaming
the
potential
negative
consequences
of
an
incorrect
scope
determination
could
be
mitigated
by
narrowing
the
definition
of
gaming
so
that
the
final
rule
text
itself
provides
a
clear
unequivocal
standard
miaxdx
believes
that
the
definition
of
gaming
should
be
limited
to
those
activities
that
are
commonly
understood
to
be
gaming
contracts
involving
the
outcome
of
a
sporting
game
point
spreads
or
the
performance
of
players
in
a
sporting
game
as
miaxdx
notes
below
the
commission
may
prohibit
event
contracts
involving
elections
and
award
shows
by
promulgating
a
rule
finding
that
such
activities
are
i
similar
to
one
of
the
prohibited
enumerated
activities
under
the
cea
and
ii
contrary
to
the
public
interest
a
more
restrictive
definition
of
gaming
that
aligns
with
the
historical
understanding
of
the
word
would
facilitate
registered
entities
identification
of
in
scope
contracts
as
discussed
below
the
proposed
definition
of
gaming
includes
many
activities
that
are
not
commonly
understood
to
be
gaming
such
as
elections
and
award
shows
however
the
senate
colloquy
regarding
cea
section
does
not
reference
award
shows
or
elections
and
instead
focuses
on
games
and
sporting
events
such
as
the
kentucky
derby
super
bowl
and
masters
golf
tournament

miaxdx
respectfully
submits
that
the
definition
of
gaming
should
be
limited
to
sporting
events
and
games
as
the
colloquy
suggests
the
cea
provides
the
commission
with
authority
to
prohibit
additional
types
of
contracts
via
the
rulemaking
process
the
commission
does
not
have
to
find
that
all
the
event
contracts
it
seeks
to
prohibit
are
gaming
contracts
because
the
cea
establishes
an
alternate
path
for
such
prohibitions
specifically
cea
section
authorizes
the
commission
to
prohibit
event
contracts
on
other
types
of
activities
if
it
promulgates
a
rule
finding
that
such
activities
are
i
similar
to
one
of
the
prohibited
enumerated
activities
under
the
cea
and
ii
contrary
to
the
public
interest
if
the
commission
seeks
to
prohibit
contracts
involving
a
broader
universe
of
activities
beyond
the
traditional
understanding
of
the
term
gaming
including
activities
like
award
shows
and
elections
then
miaxdx
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
do
so
via
rulemaking
as
contemplated
by
statute
if
the
commission
adopted
this
approach
then
contracts
involving
these
broader
topics
would
be
prohibited
but
not
as
gaming
and
therefore
an
incorrect
determination
by
a
registered
entity
under
regulation
likely
would
not
cause
the
entity
to
potentially
violate
state
gaming
or
gambling
regimes
thereby
limiting
the
legal
and
reputational
risks
to
the
exchange
or
clearinghouse
alternatively
the
commission
should
clarify
the
meaning
of
certain
prongs
of
the
proposed
gaming
definition
the
proposal
broad
definition
of
gaming
presents
significant
implementation
challenges
because
it
is
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
discern
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
definition
the
proposal
defines
gaming
as
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a

a

regardless
of
whether

miaxdx
respectfully
submits
that
this
definition
does
not
provide
registered
entities
with
clear
guidance
about
what
contracts
would
be
prohibited
as
gaming
under
any
final
rule
if
the
commission
determines
not
to
limit
the
definition
of
gaming
as
described
above
we
respectfully
request
that
the
final
definition
of
gaming
should
i
clarify
what
constitutes
a
contest
under
proposed
rule
and
ii
limit
the
catch
all
prong
of
proposed
rule
to
events
that
affect
the
outcome
of
a
contest
or
game
the
commission
should
clarify
the
scope
of
the

contest
under
the

should
consider
limiting
the

to
formal

by

parties
under
this
proposed
definition
award
shows
athletic
award
contests
and
achievement
award
contests
like
the
nobel

constitute
contests
however
contracts
that
settle
based
upon
real
world
rankings
or
outcomes
that
are
not
part
of
formal
organized
competitions
would
not
be
considered
contests
for

based
upon
the
movie
scores
reported
on
rotten
tomatoes
would
not
be
considered
a
contest
because
the
rankings
are
not
part
of
a
formal
contest
but
rather
are
critics
and
individual
real
world
rankings
similarly
a
contract
based
upon
who
is
chosen
to
be
ceo
of
a
company
would
also
not
be
a
contest
limiting
the
definition
to
formalized
competitions
ensures
that
the
prohibition
does
not
extend
to
all
circumstances
where
a
contract
is
settled
based
upon
the
competitive
performance
of
the
underlying
subject
matter
ii
the
commission
should
narrow
the
scope
of
its
proposed
category
of
prohibited
event
contract
that
references
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
proposed
rule
would
establish
a
catch
all
category
of
prohibited
gaming
contracts
for
contracts
based
on
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
regardless
of
whether
it
directly
affects
the
outcome
miaxdx
respectfully
submits
that
this
clause
should
be
narrowed
to
an
occurrence
or
nonoccurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
that
affects
the
outcome
miaxdx
believes
that
prohibiting
a
contract
based
upon
any
event
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
is
too
broad
because
it
encompasses
events
that
are
not
commonly
understood
to
be
gaming
for
example
as
commissioner
mersinger
notes
in
her
statement
accompanying
the
proposal
the
proposed
definition
would
include
a
contract
on
whether
taylor
swift
attends
a
football
game
however
it
is
not
obvious
why
swift
attendance
at
the
game
constitutes
gaming
given
that
her
attendance
is
not
directly
related
to
the
outcome
of
the
game
and
indeed
may
be
determined
based
upon
factors
completely
unrelated
to
the
game
such
as
her
touring
schedule
additionally
some
contracts
that
would
be
swept
up
by
such
a
broad
definition
of
gaming
have
actual
economic
significance
independent
from
the
outcome
of
the
game
miaxdx
respectfully
submits
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
classify
these
contracts
which
are
not
related
to
the
outcome
of
the
game
are
not
traditionally
understood
as
gaming
and
have
their
own
economic
significance
in
the
real
world
as
gaming
for
example
contracts
based
upon
event
attendance
number
of
hot
dogs
sold
or
television
ratings
all
have
economic
consequences
independent
from
the
outcome
of
the
game
itself
under
the
proposed
revised
definition
of
gaming
none
of
these
contracts
would
be
prohibited
as
gaming
because
they
do
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
game
in
contrast
miaxdx
believes
it
is
appropriate
to
include
within
the
definition
of
gaming
any
contract
based
upon
point
spreads
or
the
individual
performance
of
competitors
contracts
based
upon
such
activities
directly
impact
the
outcome
of
the
game
or
contest
moreover
they
are
commonly
understood
to
constitute
gaming
and
therefore
would
be
easier
for
registered
entities
to
identify
as
in
scope
in
contrast
including
any
event
in
connection
with
a
contest
or
game
could
conceivably
include
many
events
that
are
merely
tangential
and
potentially
totally
unrelated
to
the
underlying
contest
or
game
for
these
reasons
miaxdx
respectfully
requests
that
this
prong
of
the
gaming
definition
be
limited
to
an
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
such
a
contest
or
game
that
affects
the
outcome
miaxdx
appreciates
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
the
proposal
and
looks
forward
to
continued
engagement
with
the
cftc
throughout
the
rulemaking
process
