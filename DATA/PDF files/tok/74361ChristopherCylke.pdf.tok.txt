the
american
gaming
association
aga
appreciates
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
or
commission
providing
an
opportunity
to
comment
on
proposed
amendments
to
its
rules
concerning
event
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
this
comment
letter
begins
by
offering
a
short
background
regarding
the
gaming
industry
particularly
the
development
of
regulated
sports
betting
since
murphy
138
ct
1461
2018
the
aga
then
addresses
three
points
concerning
the
proposed
event
contracts
rule
the
proposal
1
the
commission
should
clarify
that
the
proposal
is
not
intended
to
conflict
with
state
regulated
gaming
activity
2
the
aga
opposes
the
rule
to
the
extent
it
forecloses
the
possibility
of
an
institutional
futures
market
for
sports
betting
operators
to
hedge
legitimate
commercial
risks
and
3
the
cftc
should
clarify
that
gaming
itself
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
background
the
aga
is
the
national
trade
group
representing
the
329
billion
casino
industry
which
supports
million
jobs
and
generates
53
billion
in
annual
tax
revenue
for
critical
public
services
including
education
public
safety
and
infrastructure
today
gaming
industry
is
not
only
a
great
source
of
entertainment
but
also
an
economic
driver
and
community
partner
in
47
states
and
the
district
of
columbia
aga
members
include
commercial
and
tribal
casino
operators
gaming
suppliers
and
manufacturers
legal
sportsbooks
and
other
gaming
affiliated
entities
as
champions
for
the
gaming
industry
the
aga
works
in
washington
and
across
the
country
to
ensure
sound
public
policy
that
supports
growth
innovation
and
reinvestment
in
may
2018
the
supreme
court
struck
down
the
professional
and
amateur
sports
protection
act
paspa
28
3701
et
seq
1992
a
decades
old
federal
law
that
prevented
states
other
than
nevada
and
a
few
others
from
allowing
legal
regulated
wagers
on
collegiate
and
professional
sports
this
federal
prohibition
created
a
massive
illegal
market
along
with
myriad
associated
public
policy
problems
the
supreme
court
decision
was
a
win
for
millions
of
americans
who
seek
to
participate
in
sports
wagering
in
a
safe
legal
and
regulated
manner
states
can
now
set
their
own
policies
to
legalize
and
regulate
sports
betting
in
an
effective
manner
that
protects
consumers
and
creates
tax
benefits
for
local
communities
pursuant
to
state
compacts
and
the
indian
gaming
regulatory
act
sovereign
tribal
nations
are
able
to
do
the
same
in
six
years
the
landscape
has
transformed
and
38
states
and
washington
now
have
legal
regulated
sports
betting
and
as
evidenced
by
the
more
than
363
billion
wagered
through
licensed
sports
books
since
paspa
repeal
it
is
clear
that
it
serves
the
public
interest
for
americans
to
have
legal
channels
available
to
bet
on
sports
ii
the
cftc
should
clarify
that
the
proposal
does
not
conflict
with
state
regulated
activity
the
aga
notes
that
on
its
face
the
proposal
does
not
appear
to
affect
state
regulated
activity
related
to
sports
betting
or
legal
gaming
but
the
proposal
also
lacks
any
mention
or
recognition
that
it
is
explicitly
not
intended
to
conflict
with
state
regulated
gaming
activity

state
regulated
sportsbooks
in
trying
to
comprehend
where
the
commission
gaming
derivatives
begin
and
traditional
bets
end
will
be
captured
in
this
confusion
and
question
the
need
to
register
with
the
commission
as
exchanges
out
of
an
abundance
of
cation
the
aga
therefore
requests
that
the
commission
1
clarify
its
intent
to
ensure
the
proposal
does
not
set
up
a
conflict
between
federal
regulation
and
state
law
expressly
acknowledge
continuation
of
excising
regulated
business
models
and
2
clarify
it
will
not
pursue
cea
and
cftc
rule
violation
where
a
company
is
authorized
under
state
law
to
enter
into
or
offer
such
contracts
iii
the
commission
should
allow
for
a
regulated
market
for
sports
betting
operators
to
hedge
risk
in
addition
to
the
prior
clarification
the
aga
urges
the
commission
to
revise
the
proposal
to
clearly
allow
licensed
gaming
entities
to
use
event
contracts
on
sports
contests
to
hedge
against
legitimate
commercial
risk
as
the
commission
notes
gaming
is
a
rapidly
evolving
field
and
institutions
in
the
space
should
have
access
to
a
safe
regulated
market
to
hedge
commercial
risk
this
can
be
achieved
in
a
way
that
safeguards
the
public
interest
while
working
in
concert
with
state
and
tribal
regulatory
regimes
to
support
the
stability
and
growth
of
the
regulated
sports
betting
market
iv
the
commission
should
clarify
that
gaming
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
emphasize
that
gaming
is
not
contrary
to
the
public
interest
when
dodd
frank
passed
in
2010
sports
betting
was
legal
in
nevada
and
a
few
other
states
in
2024
it
is
legal
in
38
states
and
washington
the
aga
respectfully
requests
that
the
commission
avoid
declaring
this
legal
regulated
industry
as
being
contrary
to
the
public
interest
the
commission
should
clarify
that
the
proposal
is
not
intended
to
conflict
with
state
regulated
gaming
activity
as
the
commission
also
notes
gaming
is
a
rapidly
evolving
field
a
regulated
market
where
operators
can
hedge
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risks
would
serve
an
important
commercial
purpose
the
commission
should
evaluate
options
for
narrowing
the
proposal
to
permit
such
trading
and
finally
38
states
and
washington
have
decided
that
some
form
of
regulated
gaming
is
in
their
public
interest
the
commission
should
not
undermine
those
conclusions
the
aga
stands
ready
to
engage
with
the
cftc
to
ensure
regulations
allow
for
appropriate
innovation
and
product
development
to
meet
the
bona
fide
commercial
needs
of
the
sports
betting
ecosystem
as
it
continues
to
mature
