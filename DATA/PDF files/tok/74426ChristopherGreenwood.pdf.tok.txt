professor

university
of
chicago
in
my
opinion
the
commission
should
approve
this
contract
political
elections
are
a
major
source
of
economic
risk
there
are
good
reasons
to
expect
that
election
prediction
markets
will
be
a
beneficial
tool
for
improving
hedging
and
efficiency
of
economic
decision
making
that
is
contingent
on
such
risks
existing
evidence
suggests
that
such
contracts
have
performed
well
in
the
past
it
is
worthwhile
to
experiment
with
this
contract
and
to
expand
the
use
of
such
contracts
in
the
event
that
this
experiment
has
a
positive
outcome
important
insights
into
these
issues
are
provided
in
a
special
symposium

both
papers
provide
many
additional
relevant
citations
do
these
contracts
involve
relate
to
or
reference
gaming
as
described
in
commission
regulation
and
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
or
in
the
alternative
involve
relate
to
or
reference
an
activity
that
is
similar
to
gaming
as
described
in
regulation
or
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
it
is
not
appropriate
to
view
any
election
contract
as
gaming
gaming
involves
betting
on
outcomes
that
are
intrinsically
enjoyable
but
have
no
economic
effect
such
as
sporting
events
elections
have
far
reaching
economic
effects
a
better
analogy
is
trading
on
futures
contracts
for
interest
rates
or
commodities
prices
do
the
contracts
serve
a
hedging
function
are
the
economic
consequences
of
congressional
control
predictable
enough
for
a
contract
based
on
that
control
to
serve
a
hedging
function
please
provide
tangible
examples
of
commercial
activity
that
can
be
hedged
directly
by
the
contracts
or
economic
analysis
that
demonstrates
the
hedging
utility
of
the
contracts
these
types
of
contracts
can
be
extremely
valuable
for
hedging
the
economic
effects
of
election
outcomes
are
enormous
even
with
respect
to
local
elections
but
certainly
for
national
elections
this
implies
large
economic
uncertainties
and
risks
associated
with
elections
election
prediction
markets
can
be
a
valuable
tool
to
help
many
types
of
economic
agents
to
hedge
their
risks
even
if
the
market
or
transaction
size
is
too
small
for
direct
hedging
of
risks
prediction
markets
hedge
risks
more
deeply
because
they
can
provide
more
accurate
real
time
predictions
of
the
likelihood
of
various
outcomes
that
provides
better
information
which
can
be
used
to
improve
the
quality
of
decision
making
investments
etc
for
example
consider
a
firm
contemplating
a
large
capital
investment
with
value
contingent
on
the
outcome
of
an
election
better
quality
predictions
about
the
election
can
improve
the
timing
type
and
magnitude
of
investment
increasing
economic
efficiency
are
there
unique
economic
risks
tied
to
the
outcome
of
congressional
control
that
can
not
be
hedged
via
derivative
products
on
equities
debt
interest
rates
tax
rates
asset
values
and
other
commodity
prices
the
economic
risks
of
election
outcomes
can
be
imperfectly
hedged
via
other
means
currently
available
however
prediction
markets
on
these
enormously
significant
events
can
greatly
improve
the
ability
to
hedge
directly
and
via
improved
economic
decision
making
as
described
above
moreover
evidence
from
academic
research
suggests
that
these
types
of
contracts
are
a
very
promising
tool
they
tend
to
outperform
other
methods
polling
moreover
there
is
little
evidence
that
attempts
to
manipulate
such
markets
succeed
these
points
are
discussed
in
wolfers
amp
zitzewitz
rhode
amp
strumpf
should
the
commission
consider
the
contract
design
and
payout
when
trying
to
assess
the
economic
utility
of
the
contract
for
example
are
binary
contracts
useful
for
hedging
nonbinary
economic
events
binary
contracts
are
useful
and
have
the
virtue
of
simplicity
in
design
and
execution
however
the
commission
should
consider
future
applications
with
non
binary
contracts
that
includes
markets
with
multiple
possible
outcomes
a
set
of
competing
presidential
candidates
but
also
index
and
spread
contracts
