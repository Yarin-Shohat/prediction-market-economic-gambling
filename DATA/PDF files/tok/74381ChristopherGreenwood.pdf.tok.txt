responding
to
the
cftc
request
for
comment
on
kalshiex

kalshi
proposed
congressional
control
contracts
we
write
this
comment
in
support
of
kalshi
proposed
contracts
regarding
control
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate
sequoia

sequoia
has
been
an
investor
in
kalshi
since
2020
we
invest
in
companies
that
have
the
potential
to
become
enduring
institutions
and
a
powerful
force
for
good
we
invested
in
kalshi
because
we
believe
that
an
events
marketplace
can
become
a
very
valuable
business
in
the
long
run
as
the
cftc
considers
kalshi
proposal
we
wanted
to
highlight
two
specific
areas
value
in
political
prediction
markets
first
we
believe
that
political
prediction
markets
provide
valuable
data
points
to
the
public
by
unlocking
the
wisdom
of
the
crowds
thousands
of
participants
trading
creates
information
about
the
state
of
an
electoral
race
which
is
far
more
likely
to
be
accurate
than
the
predictions
of
political
analysts
many
of
whom
are
incentivized
to
facilitate
a
particular
outcome
we
believe
this
information
could
cut
through
the
noise
from
polling
news
and
other
sources
of
information
that
may
have
negative
impacts
on
elections
and
the
public
confidence
in
elections
and
the
electoral
process
in
fact
allowing
these
markets
could
bolster
civic
literacy
and
honesty
and
is
in
the
public
interest
in
a
political
prediction
market
hedgers
and
traders
would
be
able
to
provide
fast
moving
accurate
information
about
an
electoral
race
that
incorporates
polls
fundamentals
platforms
and
any
other
salient
changes
because
hedgers
and
traders
have
a
profit
incentive
to
get
this
right
any
inaccuracy
is
quickly
traded
away
and
the
crowd
wisdom
would
prevail
though
these
types
of
markets
have
existed
previously
the
lack
of
a
legal
well
regulated
market
has
limited
the
ability
for
them
to
break
into
the
mainstream
moreover
an
educated
electorate
is
an
engaged
electorate
the
reasonable
assumption
is
that
market
participants
would
learn
about
what
they
trade
traders
would
accordingly
spend
hours
learning
about
the
ins
and
outs
of
a
race
becoming
more
informed
citizens
in
the
process
the
public
interest
in
these
markets
are
vast
impact
on
electoral
process
second
in
question
13
the
cftc
has
asked
about
the
potential
impact
on
electoral
integrity
we
believe
that
kalshi
proposal
does
not
pose
a
risk
to
the
integrity
of
the
election
system
nor
impact
the
popular
perception
of
the
integrity
of
the
elections
concerns
about
the
potential
impact
on
election
integrity
are
not
supported
by
data
we
have
years
of
data
from
organizations
like
predictit
and
similar
entities
in
other
countries
like
the
united
kingdom
where
they
have
hosted
so
called
majorities
contracts
for
decades
the
market
has
not
identified
data
that
show
that
this
market
activity
has
caused
any
election
manipulation
and
we
believe
what
kalshi
is
proposing
is
safe
and
would
not
lead
to
election
manipulation
many
hypothetical
concerns
regard
the
small
margins
in
minor
elections
for
example
local
or
state
elections
however
kalshi
is
not
proposing
to
offer
contracts
on
smaller
elections
but
is
rather
proposing
a
contract
on
which
party
controls
the
house
and
senate
which
involves
many
elections
with
tens
of
millions
of
voters
it
is
worth
noting
that
kalshi
proposed
position
limits
are
not
high
the
incentive
to
manipulate
the
market
at
this
low
level
is
nearly
non
existent
in
fact
we
believe
that
the
market
could
absorb
much
higher
position
limits
without
any
risk
of
manipulation
perhaps
a
low
limit
might
be
required
for
an
election
with
a
small
voting
base
such
as
a
mayoral
race
in
a
mid
sized
city
or
a
governorship
of
a
small
state
but
that
is
not
the
case
before
us
considering
that
control
of
congress
consists
of
hundreds
of
elections
involving
tens
of
millions
of
voters
there
is
no
incentive
for
any
individual
to
change
their
vote
nor
attempt
to
change
the
vote
of
others
the
upside
is
far
too
low
and
uncertain
considering
the
risks
and
expense
involved
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
to
submit
a
comment
related
to
kalshi
proposal
we
are
excited
about
the
promise
that
prediction
markets
can
bring
in
enhancing
forecasting
and
expanding
access
to
valuable
information
about
elections
and
we
encourage
the
cftc
to
approve
kalshi
proposal
