dear
kirkpatrick
thank
you
for
providing
an
opportunity
for
the
public
to
comment
on
the
commission
proposed
rules
pr
8907
24
i
write
to
express
my
opposition
to
the
proposed
rules
my
reasons
are
detailed
below
adoption
of
the
proposed
rules
would
unfairly
impact
the
ability
of
legal
businesses
in
the
gaming
industry
to
hedge
unwanted
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risks
by
prohibiting
event
contracts
designed
with
gaming
industry
risks
in
mind
or
the
approval
of
specialized
derivatives
exchanges
offering
such
contracts
this
imposes
an
unfair
burden
on
firms
in
the
gaming
industry
the
commission
justifies
the
proposed
rules
based
on
its
interpretation
of
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
inclusion
of
cea
section
from
a
colloquy
between
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
reported
in
the
congressional
record
on
15
july
2010
however
the
reasoning
underlying
the
statements
by
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
is
flawed
the
proposed
rules
would
impose
an
unrealistic
and
unnecessary
burden
on
those
seeking
commission
approval
of
new
event
contracts
and
if
the
proposed
rules
were
imposed
retroactively
to
approved
futures
contracts
it
would
likely
result
in
many
if
not
most
existing
futures
contracts
being
delisted
this
is
unlikely
to
have
been
the
true
intent
of
congress
1
proposed
rules
make
it
difficult
for
legal
businesses
to
hedge
legitimate
business
risks
many
states
have
determined
that
sports
betting
is
in
the
public
interest
and
have
allowed
sports
betting
firms
to
operate
in
their
states
these
firms
seek
to
manage
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risks
the
commission
has
resisted
requests
to
approve
specialized
exchanges
or
derivative
contracts
to
be
offered
on
existing
exchanges
for
the
gaming
industry
the
proposed
rules
would
make
it
more
difficult
for
firms
in
the
gaming
industry
to
efficiently
manage
risk
this
is
contrary
to
the
public
interest

liquid
futures
markets
require
both
hedgers
and
speculators
the
colloquy
between
senators
lincoln
and
feinstein
is
used
to
support
a
broader
definition
of
the
public
interest
and
an
expanded
economic
purpose
test
that
includes
the
requirement
that
the
predominant
users
of
a
new
futures
contract
must
be
hedgers
again
the
statement
that
contracts
must
be
predominantly
used
by
hedgers
reveals
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
futures
markets
by
both
senators
market
participants
want
to
trade
on
deep
liquid
markets
with
tight
bid
ask
spreads
and
where
price
discovery
occurs
quickly
this
requires
the
participation
of
both
hedgers
and
speculators
consider
the
following
real
world
example
the
treasury
market
is
arguably
the
largest
and
most
liquid
fixed
income
securities
market
in
the
world
much
of
the
liquidity
in
the
spot
market
is
provided
by
primary
government
securities
dealers
however
their
willingness
to
do
so
depends
in
part
on
their
ability
to
hedge
their
risk
exposure
by
transferring
unwanted
risks
to
speculators
on
tuesday
october
20
1987
in
the
wake
of
the
stock
market
crash
the
day
before
30
year
treasury
bonds
experienced
their
largest
one
day
rally
ever
spot
market
trading
essentially
ceased
after
treasury
futures
prices
went
quickly
lock
limit
up
no
primary
government
securities
dealer
would
make
a
market
for
treasury
securities
in
the
spot
market
because
the
futures
market
was
closed
and
the
primary
government
securities
dealers
could
not
hedge
themselves
normal
trading
resumed
in
the
treasury
spot
market
after
the
futures
markets
reopened
and
hedgers
could
transfer
unwanted
risks
to
speculators
in
the
futures
markets
speculators
are
frequently
needed
to
take
the
other
side
of
futures
contracts
when
hedgers
put
on
hedges
there
is
often
a
dearth
of
speculators
during
financial
crises
and
not
a
dearth
of
hedgers
3
speculators
in
existing
futures
markets
may
profit
from
devastating
events
the
commission
argues
that
former
senator
blanche
lincoln
statement
that
cea
section
was
intended
to
provide
the
cftc
with
the
power
to
prevent
the
creation
of
futures
and
swaps
markets
that
would
allow
citizens
to
profit
from
devastating
events
and
also
prevent
gambling
through
futures
markets
emphasis
added
senator
lincoln
statement
reveals
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
how
futures
markets
function
futures
markets
rely
on
both
hedgers
and
speculators
to
create
deep
liquid
markets
that
promote
efficient
price
discovery
hedging
against
potential
adverse
price
moves
locks
in
a
purchase
or
selling
price
futures
markets
rely
on
both
hedgers
and
speculators
to
create
deep
liquid
markets
with
efficient
price
discovery
consider
the
following
examples
a
farmer
fears
that
the
price
of
corn
may
fall
before
his
corn
crop
is
harvested
so
the
farmer
sells
corn
futures
contracts
today
to
lock
in
a
selling
price
a
speculator
takes
the
other
side
of
the
position
and
buys
corn
futures
if
the
spot
price
of
corn
is
lower
when
the
corn
is
harvested
the
lower
price
that
the
farmer
receives
for
his
corn
in
the
spot
market
is
offset
by
the
profit
he
has
made
on
his
futures
market
position
ignoring
transaction
costs
and
assuming
that
the
basis
is
zero
at
contract
expiration
the
farmer
gain
in
the
futures
market
is
exactly
equal
to
the
speculator
loss
now
suppose
that
a
severe
drought
hits
the
corn
belt
destroying
a
large
amount
of
the
corn
crop
in
the
soil
the
price
of
corn
rises
dramatically
the
farmer
unaffected
by
the
drought
sells
his
corn
crop
at
the
substantially
higher
spot
price
but
his
corresponding
short
futures
position
experiences
significant
losses
after
considering
the
gains
from
selling
his
corn
crop
at
the
sharply
higher
spot
price
and
the
losses
from
his
futures
position
the
farmer
has
sold
his
corn
crop
at
the
fixed
price
that
he
wanted
to
given
his
earlier
fear
that
corn
spot
prices
might
fall
sharply
by
the
time
his
corn
crop
is
harvested
the
speculator
earns
substantial
profits
from
his
long
position
in
corn
futures
as
corn
prices
rose
due
to
a
devastating
event
drought
in
the
corn
belt
a
shale
oil
producer
routinely
hedges
its
anticipated
output
in
the
futures
market
by
selling
crude
oil
futures
contracts
to
lock
in
a
selling
price
a
speculator
takes
the
other
side
of
the
position
and
buys
crude
oil
futures
contracts
a
major
energy
producing
nation
suddenly
invades
another
country
prompting
sanctions
on
its
oil
production
and
crude
oil
prices
skyrocket
the
shale
oil
producer
extra
revenue
from
selling
oil
in
the
spot
market
at
sharply
higher
prices
per
barrel
is
offset
by
losses
on
his
short
crude
oil
futures
position
the
shale
oil
producer
succeeded
in
locking
in
a
selling
price
for
crude
oil
the
speculator
long
position
in
crude
oil
has
benefitted
greatly
due
to
a
devastating
event
a
surprise
foreign
war
a
steakhouse
restaurant
chain
fears
that
the
price
of
beef
might
rise
so
it
locks
in
a
purchase
price
by
buying
live
cattle
futures
a
speculator
takes
the
other
side
of
the
transaction
shortly
after
putting
on
its
hedge
a
case
of
mad
cow
disease
is
discovered
in
canada
even
though
canadian
cattle
are
deliverable
on
the
us
cattle
futures
contract
the
price
of
live
cattle
drops
sharply
the
savings
the
restaurant
chain
subsequently
has
from
being
able
to
buy
beef
at
a
lower
price
in
the
spot
market
are
offset
by
its
losses
on
its
long
live
cattle
futures
position
the
speculator
short
position
has
benefited
greatly
due
to
a
devastating
event
discovery
of
mad
cow
disease
in
a
canadian
cattle
herd
put
differently
the
speculators
in
the
above
examples
were
able
to
profit
from
devastating
events
something
that
senator
lincoln
wanted
to
see
the
commission
prevent
happening
while
hedgers
were
able
to
lock
in
a
buying
or
selling
price
one
could
easily
imagine
similar
scenarios
for
most
other
futures
contracts
should
the
commission
ban
corn
futures
crude
oil
futures
live
cattle
futures
etc
to
ensure
that
speculators
never
profit
from
devastating
events
one
could
also
easily
imagine
scenarios
where
speculators
suffer
substantial
losses
from
devastating
events
while
hedgers
are
also
able
to
lock
in
a
buying
or
selling
price
indeed
the
gains
that
hedgers
receive
in
such
scenarios
come
from
the
losses
borne
by
speculators
ignoring
transaction
costs
derivatives
do
not
eliminate
risk
they
merely
transfer
risk
between
or
among
parties
4
most
futures
contracts
are
gaming
contracts
given
that
speculators
dominate
trading
the
colloquy
between
senators
lincoln
and
feinstein
is
also
used
to
support
an
unusual
definition
of
gaming
senator
feinstein
asks
senator
lincoln
will
cftc
have
the
power
to
determine
that
a
contract
is
a
gaming
contract
if
the
predominant
use
of
the
contract
is
speculative
as
opposed
to
a
hedging
or
economic
use
senator
lincoln
replies
that
is
our
intent
again
the
colloquy
reveals
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
about
the
nature
of
futures
markets
by
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
speculation
dominates
most
trading
in
futures
markets
rarely
is
a
buy
hedge
on
the
other
side
of
a
sell
hedge
and
vice
versa
rather
speculators
create
the
deep
liquid
futures
markets
that
make
it
easy
for
hedgers
to
hedge
indeed
many
existing
futures
contracts
would
need
to
be
redefined
as
gaming
contracts
if
the
criterion
is
the
amount
of
speculation
versus
hedging
it
is
doubtful
that
reclassifying
virtually
all
existing
futures
contracts
as
gaming
contracts
because
the
market
is
dominated
by
speculators
and
other
traders
without
a
commercial
or
hedging
interest
was
the
intent
of
congress
given
that
the
commission
was
subsequently
reauthorized
the
commission
has
wisely
rejected
the
definition
of
gaming
by
senators
feinstein
and
lincoln
in
its
proposed
narrow
definition
of
gaming
however
the
commission
should
not
use
senator
feinstein
and
senator
lincoln
criterion
as
part
of
an
expanded
economic
purpose
test
doing
so
imposes
an
unnecessary
burden
on
those
proposing
new
event
contracts
especially
given
that
many
existing
futures
contracts
would
be
hard
pressed
to
meet
that
same
standard
5
some
event
contracts
on
exempted
commodities
meet
the
proposed
gaming
definition
the
commission
cites
senator
lincoln
colloquy
with
senator
feinstein
to
support
the
notion
that
congress
intended
to
prohibit
event
contracts
on
sporting
events
senator
lincoln
stated
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
construct
an
event
contract
around
sporting
events
such
as
the
super
bowl
the
kentucky
derby
and
masters
golf
tournament
these
types
of
contracts
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
rather
they
would
be
used
solely
for
gambling
the
commission
correctly
notes
that
sporting
events
themselves
are
not
considered
gaming
instead
the
commission
argues
on
page
23
that
cea
section
focuses
on
the
overall
characteristics
of
the
contract
and
the
question
for
the
commission
in
evaluating
whether
a
contract
involves
an
enumerated
activity
or
prescribed
similar
activity
is
whether
the
contract
considered
as
a
whole
involves
one
of
those
activities
the
commission
also
argues
that
commodities
listed
in
cea
section
would
be
excluded
from
the
proposed
rules
on
event
contracts
these
commodities
include
among
others
an
index
or
measure
of
inflation
or
other
macroeconomic
index
or
measure
the
commission
argues
that
these
commodities
should
be
excluded
because
they
already
served
as
underlyings
for
a
range
of
derivative
contracts
that
were
broadly
traded
on
cftc
registered
exchanges
at
the
time
of
enactment
of
cea
section
it
is
easy
to
imagine
event
contracts
tied
to
the
release
of
various
government
macroeconomic
reports
such
as
the
inflation
rate
or
the
jobs
employment
situation
report
these
reports
are
closely
watched
by
market
participants
and
often
have
a
significant
impact
on
financial
market
prices
when
the
outcome
from
the
report
differs
from
the
consensus
expectation
of
the
outcome
economists
at
major
financial
institutions
participate
in
surveys
capturing
their
beliefs
as
to
what
the
reports
will
indicate
various
consensus
forecasts
are
obtained
by
averaging
the
forecasts
of
surveyed
economists
basically
market
participants
are
trying
to
determine
whether
the
realized
outcome
the
monthly
inflation
rate
or
nonfarm
payrolls
the
number
of
new
jobs
created
in
a
month
will
be
greater
or
less
than
the
consensus
forecast
of
economists
put
differently
market
participants
are
arguably
staking
funds
on
the
outcome
of
a
competition
among
economists
this
seems
to
meet
the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
that
is
the
staking
or
risking
by
any
person
of
something
of
value
upon
i
the
outcome
of
a
contest
of
others
ii
the
outcome
of
a
game
involving
skill
or
chance
iii
the
performance
of
one
or
more
competitors
in
one
or
more
contests
or
games
or
iv
any
other
occurrence
or
non
occurrence
in
connection
with
one
or
more
contests
or
games
if
so
how
would
a
potential
event
contract
on
a
macroeconomic
index
or
measure
differ
from
an
event
contract
on
a
gaming
industry
variable
if
they
do
differ
it
appears
that
the
commission
proposed
definition
of
gaming
would
be
selectively
applied
to
the
detriment
of
firms
in
the
gaming
industry
in
need
of
tools
to
manage
their
risk
exposure
finally
senator
lincoln
assertion
that
event
contracts
around
sporting
events
would
not
serve
any
real
commercial
purpose
but
would
be
used
solely
for
gambling
ignores
both
the
need
that
firms
in
the
sports
betting
industry
have
to
manage
their
exposure
to
legitimate
business
risks
and
the
potential
benefit
that
specialized
event
contracts
may
offer
such
firms
in
managing
their
risk
exposures
again
nearly
forty
states
have
determined
that
allowing
betting
on
sports
events
is
in
the
public
interest
sports
betting
firms
are
regulated
and
licensed
they
have
legitimate
business
risks
they
should
be
allowed
to
use
tools
that
would
help
them
manage
their
exposure
to
such
risks
