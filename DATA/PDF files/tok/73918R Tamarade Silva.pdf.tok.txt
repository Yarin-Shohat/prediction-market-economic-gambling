advocating
for
event
futures
contracts
as
bona
fide
risk
transfer
mechanisms
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
is
proposing
amendments
to
further
specify
types
of
event
contracts
that
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
of
the
commodity
exchange
act
cea
and
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
such
that
they
may
not
be
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
on
or
through
a
cftc
registered
entity
as
a
lawyer
in
the
futures
and
derivatives
space
and
before
this
a
floor
trader
and
broker
i
am
writing
to
advocate
for
the
recognition
and
inclusion
of
futures
events
contracts
as
legitimate
tools
for
risk
transfer
particularly
in
the
context
of
systemic
risks
and
catastrophic
events
modern
portfolio
diversification
strategies
while
effective
against
market
volatility
fall
short
in
addressing
systemic
risks
that
result
from
catastrophic
events
as
such
futures
markets
present
a
valuable
opportunity
to
hedge
against
these
risks
much
as
interest
rate
contracts
and
financial
market
index
contracts
are
already
risk
benchmarks
vital
to
the
global
financial
markets
argument
for
bona
fide
risk
transfer
systemic
risks
by
their
nature
affect
large
portions
of
the
market
simultaneously
rendering
traditional
diversification
strategies
ineffective
catastrophic
events
including
climate
related
disasters
can
have
widespread
financial
impacts
that
transcend
individual
market
segments
futures
contracts
tailored
to
these
risks
provide
entities
with
a
mechanism
to
hedge
against
potential
losses
thus
enhancing
financial
stability
the
introduction
of
futures
contracts
focused
on
political
events
and
even
climate
and
other
catastrophic
risks
would
contribute
to
overall
market
stability
by
allowing
for
risk
transfer
by
providing
a
structured
way
for
businesses
and
governments
to
manage
risk
these
contracts
can
mitigate
the
financial
disruptions
caused
by
unforeseen
catastrophic
events
this
stability
is
essential
for
maintaining
investor
confidence
and
ensuring
the
smooth
functioning
of
financial
markets
futures
markets
are
instrumental
in
generating
forward
looking
price
signals
that
reflect
collective
market
expectations
contracts
based
on
catastrophic
events
can
provide
valuable
information
on
perceived
risks
and
potential
impacts
aiding
in
better
risk
assessment
and
planning
these
signals
can
drive
investments
in
mitigation
and
adaptation
strategies
contributing
to
broader
societal
resilience
against
systemic
risks
the
evolution
of
financial
markets
has
always
been
driven
by
innovation
the
development
and
adoption
of
futures
contracts
for
systemic
risks
represent
a
natural
progression
in
the
financial
sector
ability
to
manage
complex
risks
these
instruments
can
attract
new
participants
enhance
liquidity
and
promote
a
deeper
understanding
of
risk
dynamics
the
cftc
mandate
includes
promoting
market
integrity
and
protecting
market
participants
enabling
futures
contracts
for
catastrophic
risks
aligns
with
these
goals
by
providing
robust
risk
management
tools
that
protect
against
significant
financial
disruptions
moreover
these
contracts
can
support
public
policy
initiatives
aimed
at
enhancing
economic
resilience
and
sustainability
modern
portfolio
theory
mpt
primarily
addresses
unsystematic
risk
through
diversification
but
does
not
adequately
account
for
systemic
risks
historical
events
such
as
the
2008
financial
crisis
and
recent
climate
related
disasters
have
highlighted
the
limitations
of
mpt
in
shielding
portfolios
from
systemic
shocks
futures
contracts
for
systemic
risks
offer
a
complementary
risk
management
tool
enabling
investors
to
hedge
against
large
scale
disruptions
that
traditional
diversification
can
not
mitigate
comparison
with
election
event
contracts
on
december
11
1992
the
chicago
board
of
trade
cbot
introduced
catastrophic
insurance
futures
contracts
they
were
designed
to
transfer
risks
associated
with
catastrophic
events
providing
a
valuable
hedging
tool
for
the
insurance
industry
the
foresight
of
the
exchange
was
remarkable
arguably
we
may
be
seeing
what
happens
when
the
insurance
industry
can
not
adequately
transfer
risk
and
the
costs
are
passed
to
the
consumer
public
while
there
may
arguably
be
valid
public
policy
reasons
to
exclude
election
event
contracts
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
they
share
similarities
with
catastrophic
events
in
terms
of
the
systemic
risks
they
pose
to
the
market
allowing
futures
contracts
for
such
events
would
provide
a
structured
risk
transfer
mechanism
benefiting
market
stability
and
offering
protection
against
significant
financial
disruptions
the
concept
of
bona
fide
risk
transfer
mechanisms
as
established
in
existing
futures
markets
extends
beyond
traditional
definitions
of
the
gaming
industry
the
futures
market
has
already
proven
effective
in
managing
the
largest
types
of
risks
that
affect
the
global
financial
markets
including
those
arising
from
systemic
and
catastrophic
events
for
example
during
the
crash
of
1987
market
participants
were
able
to
short
the
equity
market
through
the
use
of
futures
by
considering
the
inclusion
of
election
contracts
within
this
framework
the
commission
can
enhance
the
market
ability
to
manage
a
broader
range
of
risks
this
approach
aligns
with
the
overarching
goal
of
providing
robust
risk
management
tools
to
market
participants
game
theory
argument
from
a
game
theory
perspective
the
inclusion
of
futures
contracts
for
catastrophic
events
can
create
a
more
resilient
market
structure
in
an
environment
where
market
participants
can
hedge
against
systemic
risks
the
overall
market
becomes
more
robust
and
less
susceptible
to
panic
and
systemic
failures
this
strategic
interaction
benefits
all
participants
by
distributing
risk
more
effectively
reducing
the
likelihood
of
extreme
outcomes
that
can
destabilize
the
entire
financial
system
moreover
by
allowing
hedging
against
large
scale
risks
futures
markets
can
encourage
proactive
risk
management
and
investment
in
mitigation
strategies
fostering
a
more
stable
economic
environment
in
game
theory
the
concept
of
nash
equilibrium
can
be
applied
to
understand
how
futures
markets
for
catastrophic
events
can
stabilize
the
financial
system
suppose
each
market
participant
i
has
a
set
of
strategies
si
which
include
hedging
through
futures
contracts
the
utility
function
ui
si
represents
the
participant
payoff
where
denotes
the
strategies
of
all
other
participants
in
a
nash
equilibrium
each
participant
strategy
is
optimal
given
the
strategies
of
others
by
hedging
through
futures
contracts
participants
mitigate
their
exposure
to
catastrophic
risks
leading
to
a
stable
equilibrium
where
no
participant
can
improve
their
utility
by
unilaterally
changing
their
strategy
this
equilibrium
reduces
the
overall
risk
in
the
system
contributing
to
market
stability
conclusion
in
conclusion
recognizing
and
incorporating
futures
contracts
as
bona
fide
risk
transfer
mechanisms
for
systemic
risks
and
catastrophic
events
aligns
with
the
fundamental
purposes
of
futures
markets
if
the
regulated
futures
markets
are
able
to
hedge
the
risk
of
the
entire
economy
through
interest
rates
and
the
domestic
capital
markets
through
financial
futures
it
can
serve
as
a
hedge
against
election
risk
i
applaud
the
work
of
the
cftc
in
its
work
of
keeping
the
united
states
futures
markets
among
if
not
the
most
transparent
and
liquid
financial
markets
in
the
world
the
commission
would
be
well
advised
to
see
how
election
and
other
event
contracts
can
play
a
crucial
role
in
enhancing
market
stability
providing
valuable
risk
signals
and
supporting
innovation
in
risk
management
it
is
up
to
the
task
i
urge
the
cftc
to
consider
these
arguments
and
facilitate
the
development
of
event
futures
contracts
thereby
strengthening
the
financial
market
ability
to
manage
systemic
risks
effectively
