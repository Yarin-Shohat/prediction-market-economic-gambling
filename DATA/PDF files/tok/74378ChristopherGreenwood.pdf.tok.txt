to
whom
it
may
concern
i
am
a
lawyer
a
policy
analyst
and
founder
of
the
think
tank
people
policy
project
over
the
last
five
years
my
organization
has
produced
research
and
policy
proposals
on
topics
including
the
welfare
state
climate
change
housing
and
social
ownership
of
wealth
before
starting
the
people
policy
project
i
worked
at
the
think
tank
demos
my
work
has
been
cited
or
featured
in
almost
every
major
media
publication
including
the
new
york
times
the
washington
post
and
the
wall
street
journal
i
am
writing
this
letter
in
support
of
allowing
kalshiex
to
offer
binary
contracts
on
which
political
party
will
be
in
control
of
the
congress
and
in
support
of
allowing
tightly
regulated
entities
to
offer
binary
contracts
on
election
outcomes
generally
filing
22
002
i
believe
that
these
contracts
serve
two
important
purposes
1
for
the
public
the
trading
of
these
contracts
produces
useful
real
time
information
about
the
important
question
of
who
is
likely
to
govern
the
country
in
the
near
future
this
information
is
widely
sought
out
already
which
is
why
many
major
publications
including
the
new
york
times
and
fivethirtyeight
publish
election
forecasts
based
on
polling
data
and
why
hundreds
of
articles
are
produced
each
election
cycle
prognosticating
about
the
election
outcome
the
implied
probabilities
produced
by
actual
traders
risking
their
own
money
gives
a
separate
insight
into
the
question
that
polling
aggregation
and
punditry
does
not
2
for
individuals
these
contracts
allow
hedging
against
certain
policy
outcomes
that
could
be
important
to
their
personal
finances
while
it
true
that
the
ultimate
policy
outcome
of
a
given
election
outcome
is
not
entirely
certain
candidate
promises
and
the
general
policy
tendencies
of
the
parties
provide
some
guidance
about
the
direction
policy
will
shift
based
on
who
wins
more
narrowly
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
individuals
who
work
in
and
around
politics
whose
life
circumstances
are
altered
quite
radically
by
political
outcomes
it
almost
certainly
true
that
most
of
the
individuals
who
would
participate
in
these
futures
markets
are
not
hedging
against
any
personal
risk
and
just
hoping
to
make
money
by
picking
the
right
side
of
a
binary
election
outcome
contract
these
kinds
of
participants
are
not
sympathetic
and
enabling
this
kind
of
behavior
should
not
be
the
aim
of
public
policy
but
these
participants
are
also
necessary
to
produce
the
valuable
informational
and
hedging
functions
of
these
contracts
so
these
considerations
need
to
be
balanced
against
one
another
and
in
my
view
the
balance
of
considerations
favors
allowing
the
contracts
lastly
it
is
worth
remembering
that
there
are
foreign
betting
markets
like
betfair
in
the
uk
where
gamblers
including
americans
already
place
wagers
on
the
outcomes
of
us
elections
bringing
election
contracts
onshore
and
regulating
them
domestically
would
reduce
the
risks
involved
in
this
market
relative
to
the
status
quo
