re
comment
on
proposed
rulemaking
on
event
contracts
dear
chair
behnam
we
are
writing
in
response
to
the
commodity
futures
trading
commission
cftc
proposal
to
amend
its
rules
concerning
event
contracts
in
certain
excluded
commodities
the
proposal
we
the
undersigned
individuals
and
organizations
firmly
support
the
cftc
proposal
due
to
the
substantial
and
multifaceted
threats
that
political
event
contracts
pose
to
our
democratic
processes
financial
market
integrity
public
trust
and
the
cftc
important
mission
serving
the
american
people
firstly
political
event
contracts
undermine
the
integrity
of
elections
by
introducing
financial
incentives
that
can
drive
manipulation
and
interference
allowing
betting
on
election
outcomes
creates
dangerous
circumstances
where
individuals
or
groups
might
attempt
to
influence
electoral
processes
for
financial
gain
this
not
only
threatens
the
fairness
of
elections
but
also
encourages
unethical
and
potentially
illegal
activities
aimed
at
skewing
results
secondly
the
proposal
is
vital
to
prevent
the
erosion
of
public
trust
in
our
electoral
system
in
an
era
where
misinformation
and
disinformation
are
rampant
adding
a
layer
of
financial
speculation
to
elections
will
exacerbate
public
skepticism
by
prohibiting
these
contracts
as
against
public
policy
the
cftc
would
help
protect
the
right
to
vote
ensure
that
those
elected
reflect
the
will
of
the
voters
preserve
the
sanctity
of
the
electoral
process
and
reinforce
the
message
that
elections
are
about
civic
duty
and
democratic
participation
not
financial
speculation
moreover
our
support
for
the
proposal
is
rooted
in
several
key
aspects
of
the
amendments
which
are
crucial
for
maintaining
the
integrity
and
fairness
of
both
our
financial
markets
and
our
democratic
systems
for
example
the
amendments
focus
on
simplifying
the
criteria
for
what
constitutes
an
event
contract
that
involves
an
enumerated
activity
such
as
political
events
is
significant
and
important
by
concentrating
solely
on
contracts
that
involve
these
activities
the
cftc
can
more
effectively
prevent
contracts
that
may
indirectly
link
to
gambling
from
being
listed
or
cleared
this
is
essential
to
close
loopholes
that
could
otherwise
be
exploited
to
introduce
harmful
speculative
practices
into
the
market
furthermore
clarifying
the
definition
of
gaming
within
the
cftc
regulatory
framework
is
a
vital
component
of
this
proposal
by
explicitly
including
the
staking
or
risking
of
something
of
value
on
the
outcome
of
various
contests
including
political
contests
the
cftc
can
more
effectively
identify
and
regulate
these
event
contracts
this
clarity
helps
ensure
that
any
event
contract
involving
political
contests
such
as
elections
is
appropriately
categorized
as
gaming
this
includes
not
only
the
outcomes
of
elections
but
also
related
events
such
as
candidate
entries
or
withdrawals
and
polling
results
this
comprehensive
approach
is
necessary
to
address
all
potential
avenues
for
speculative
gambling
on
political
events
most
importantly
the
proposed
amendment
to
categorically
determine
that
event
contracts
involving
political
contests
are
contrary
to
the
public
interest
is
a
decisive
and
necessary
measure
by
prohibiting
these
contracts
from
being
listed
for
trading
or
accepted
for
clearing
on
cftc
regulated
markets
the
cftc
is
taking
an
appropriately
strong
stance
to
protect
the
public
interest
this
prohibition
addresses
the
significant
public
interest
concerns
associated
with
political
event
contracts
ensuring
that
the
integrity
of
our
elections
and
the
public
trust
in
the
democratic
process
are
not
compromised
by
speculative
financial
activities
from
a
regulatory
perspective
the
cftc
mandate
is
to
oversee
commodity
and
derivatives
markets
making
sure
they
function
effectively
for
hedging
and
price
discovery
that
ensures
that
vitally
important
commodities
are
available
to
the
american
people
when
they
want
them
in
the
amounts
they
want
and
at
prices
that
reasonable
reflect
supply
and
demand
whether
the
cftc
does
that
job
well
or
poorly
impacts
everything
from
cereal
and
coffee
at
breakfast
bread
and
peanut
butter
in
lunch
sandwiches
gas
for
cars
and
trucks
cotton
for
shirts
and
skirts
and
sugar
in
almost
everything
in
contrast
political
event
contracts
offer
no
such
significant
hedging
benefits
and
do
not
contribute
to
price
discovery
instead
they
represent
speculative
gambling
that
falls
outside
the
cftc
regulatory
expertise
experience
and
purview
and
will
detract
the
cftc
from
its
primary
mission
by
focusing
on
commodities
that
impact
everyday
life
such
as
agricultural
products
and
energy
resources
the
cftc
can
continue
to
serve
and
protect
the
american
people
in
conclusion
the
cftc
proposal
is
a
necessary
and
decisive
action
to
protect
our
democratic
institutions
uphold
market
integrity
and
maintain
public
confidence
by
prohibiting
political
event
contracts
the
cftc
will
prevent
the
introduction
of
significant
risks
and
ensure
that
its
regulatory
focus
remains
aligned
with
its
core
mission
of
safeguarding
the
integrity
and
functionality
of
the
commodity
and
derivatives
markets
we
urge
the
cftc
to
finalize
and
implement

proposal
