Commodity Futures Trading Commission

Dear Mr. Kirkpatrick,
It was abundantly clear in watching the CFTC’s public meeting on Friday, May 10, 2024, that CFTC staff, and their complaints about the work required to regulate event contracts, are the motivation behind this proposed rule.  There are several problems with the CFTC bureaucracy dictating regulation to both the Commissioners and the public:
1) Chairman Rostin Benham has acknowledged that CFTC staff are working at the office less than one day per week on average. (You can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/live/ipnOHtIqhgg?si=4vodHZRtPcarqUKC&t=4344).  The Commission should first investigate having staff come to work more than once a week before considering banning certain event contracts to lessen staff workload.
2) The draft discussed at the public meeting would have the Commission delegate authority to CFTC staff to reject contracts.  This transfer of authority was removed by an amendment, with Chairman Benham as the only vote against it.
3) Even more embarrassing for Chairman Benham, none of the 162 lawyers in the Division of Enforcement bothered to attend this public meeting.  (Here is video from the meeting: https://www.youtube.com/live/_rZf-y5bsro?si=g2PjS_s6n3ukT2H7&t=4550)
4) While Chairman Benham claims election contracts are too burdensome for the CFTC, he’s also calling for the CFTC to regulate crypto.  It’s difficult to follow how the CFTC has difficulty regulating the former but could handle regulating the latter.
It is apparent that the Chairman lacks control over his agency or the respect of CFTC staff.  Even the other Commissioners seem to be aware of the problem.  Commissioner Caroline Pham has proposed a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study to correct “the breakdown of the Commission’s internal procedures and processes.”  One can hope that a good steward of taxpayer resources like Senator Tommy Tuberville or Representative Dusty Johnson will hold failed leadership accountable.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important matter.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) proposed rule that would classify election futures markets, such as those operated by PredictIt, as ""gaming."" This classification is fundamentally flawed and undermines the valuable role that these markets play in our democratic process.
Election futures markets are not akin to gambling. When individuals participate in markets like PredictIt, they engage in sophisticated analysis and forecasting, akin to the work of professional analysts. These markets aggregate diverse perspectives and information, producing forecasts that are often more accurate than traditional polls or expert predictions. This is because they harness the collective wisdom of informed participants who use their knowledge, experience, and intuition to make predictions.
As someone who is not a professional political trader but values the ability to engage in these markets, I have witnessed firsthand how this platform allows everyday individuals to apply their knowledge and insights to predict political outcomes. This is far from a simple game of chance. It involves continuous monitoring of news, evaluating the credibility of information, understanding historical voting patterns, and making reasoned judgments about future events. These activities are inherently analytical and reflective of a genuine investment of time and intellect, rather than mere gambling.
It is particularly concerning that while pundits and analysts can appear on networks like CNBC and Fox Business to influence stock prices and potentially benefit from their positions, ordinary citizens are being denied a similar opportunity in the realm of political futures markets. The proposed rule would unfairly restrict individuals from leveraging their understanding of political events to make informed trades, thus depriving them of the benefits that come from their knowledge and analysis.
Furthermore, election futures markets serve a public good. They provide real-time data and forecasts that are invaluable to the media, policymakers, and the public. By offering a dynamic and accurate picture of potential election outcomes, they enhance the transparency and understanding of political processes.
The proposed rule by the CFTC would not only mischaracterize the nature of these markets but would also stifle this important source of information and public engagement. The classification of election futures as ""gaming"" dismisses the sophisticated, informed decision-making that characterizes these markets and ignores their proven track record of accuracy and utility.
I urge the CFTC to reconsider this proposal and recognize the significant differences between speculative gambling and the informed trading conducted in election futures markets. The decision to restrict these markets would be a disservice to the many individuals who rely on them for valuable insights and would diminish the overall quality of information available to the public.
Please take into account the voices of those of us who have experienced firsthand the benefits and rigor of participating in election futures markets. Your decision will have a profound impact on the availability and quality of electoral information, and it is crucial to approach this matter with a full understanding of its implications.
Thank you for considering my perspective.

Markets such as Predictit limit the dollar amounts involved, making it extremely unlikely that these markets would incentivize event manipulation.  This is in contrast to sports betting markets, now legal, in which the reverse is true: sports betting dollar amounts have historically been high enough to introduce the possibility of corruption and event manipulation.  While speculation on events such as war and assassination may seem macabre, in fact these are little more than pride markets - a place where individuals measure their expertise against a pool of public belief.

""Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate, for purposes of defining “gaming” within § 40.11, to focus on the staking or risking of something of value upon a contest of others or a game, including the outcome of such contest or game, the performance of competitors in such contest or game,73 or other occurrences or non-occurrences in connection with such contest or game""
However the CFTC also says:
The Commission acknowledges that several state statutes recognize “gambling,” “betting,” or “wagering,” to encompass, more broadly, a person staking or risking something of value upon the outcome of any contingent event not in the person’s influence or control – and not just a game or a contest of others. The Commission is not proposing to define “gaming” in this manner.
Hence it is clear that to the CFTC ""gaming"" involves a game or contest, but should NOT be concerned with various state statutes or rulings which claim otherwise.
Merriam-Webster defines ""contest"" as:
1) a struggle for superiority or victory
2) a competition in which each contestant performs without direct contact with or interference from competitors
This commenter sincerely believes that the meaning of ""game or contest"" ought to be defined clearly with regard to sporting events. Otherwise, the CFTC could easily overreach and arrive at conclusions not intended by Congress. For example, a derivative (option) contract is clearly a bet or wager on the ongoing 'contest' between competing business organisations. Note that in either Merriam-Webster definition above, a company competes for business, but has no control over the price of its stock on a stock exchange (this is decided only by other bidders and sellers). Similarly an election is clearly also a contest in this regard.
It is not appropriate for the CFTC to decide that a single regulation should apply to one kind of contest but not another. Therefore the CFTC must define ""gaming"" to only apply to sporting games contests.

Furthermore, election prediction markets foster civic engagement by encouraging participants to stay informed about political developments. They serve as a modern tool for political education, stimulating interest and discussion around electoral processes and outcomes.

I am writing to express my support of political prediction markets and to advocate against imposing restrictions on these platforms.
Political predictions markets help regulate traditional markets.  They give investors quick insight into what the probability is of politicians assuming office and relevant legislation being passed.  In this manner they are no different (and in some cases more useful) than traditional futures markets are to stock investors.
They are also a check on disinformation.  As foreign and domestic actors increasingly leverage Artificial Intelligence alongside more and more sophisticated methods of manipulating public trust and opinion, prediction markets act as in ironclad bulwark against the epistemological dark-age we are sliding precipitously into.
Participation in political prediction markets also increases civic engagement and civic knowledge.  If I had never become involved in these markets, I don't think I would have ever learned who the senate parliamentarian was or what they did.  I wouldn't be watching nearly as much CSPAN as I do right now.  I would be missing out!!
Finally, they are used at the highest levels of government.  In my line of work, I have personally asked several congressmen, senators, vice-presidential hopefuls, and lobbyists if they were familiar with the platform.  Most of them are!
If my coworkers are allowed to make ridiculous fifteen-leg  parlays on their myriad sports betting apps ever 15 minutes, I should be allowed to salivate over the latest Harris-Harvard poll, cross reference to what the focus groups are saying, and update my electoral college victory predictions.

I have been both a participant in and an observer of these markets.  I think they enrich our understanding of politics, the news media, political ""conventional wisdom,"" and the extent to which crowds consistently get certain types of political predictions wrong.  In my view, these markets have considerable value for social-science work on elections, and should not be regulated in ways that ultimately amount to shutting down these markets in the United States.
In addition, I think it is worth noting that political prediction/futures markets will continue to exist in the world whether or not the CFTC authorizes them, because in the UK and elsewhere there is a robust set of these betting markets which already include markets regarding United States politics.  However, it is highly imperfect and messy to study such markets when U.S.-based participants, who would know them best, are excluded.
I do not think these markets are gaming, in the way that betting on a horse race is a form of gaming.  Although the horse race metaphor is common in politics, this is something different.  These bets are an expression of a kind of public opinion, not about what should happen in politics, but about what will happen.  Although nonrepresentative of the nation as a whole, prediction markets are worthy of study.  I hope you will not regulate them out of existence in this country.

It will do nothing to actually stop wagering on elections, but instead move it from a regulated and low limit environment into an unregulated and high limit environment, hurting traders and exacerbating all the issues the CFTC purports to care about.
The CFTC claims it is concerned about being an ""election cop."" Initially, this makes little sense. We already have a Federal Elections Commission that is an actual election cop as well as state level Secretaries of State who run elections and certify winners. So it is unclear what role the CFTC thinks it would have to play.
For instance, a market on say a Nevada Senate race can simply specify in its rules that the market will resolve when the state Secretary of State certifies the winner on X date in accordance with state election law. The CFTC does not have to make any determination, and the sources for determination are readily available. This is the case in every election in the United States. Tellingly, the CFTC cannot come up with a single example of how it would have to be an election cop.
The CFTC also claims that it is worried about the integrity of elections. Again, despite the fact that Predictit and other markets have existed for years there are no examples of markets actually hampering the integrity of elections.
In order to rig an election that one bet on, one would not only need to risk a long prison sentence, but presumably enter into a conspiracy with many other people by providing them a financial motive for such an extreme risk.  Predictit has an $850 limit, there is no scenario in which risking all of that would be financially profitable.
I understand Kalshi is seeking larger limits and I think the CFTC and/or Congress might have a legitimate role to play in deciding whether say a six figure bet on say a single congressional or mayoral race is wise, but instead the CFTC has persisted in an arbitrary one size fits all policy. Again, if the CFTC cannot cite a single example from Predictit and the Iowa Electronics Markets long existence of any threat to election integrity, it's probably because it doesn't exist.
Finally, the proposed rule purports to ban election prediction markets as ""gaming"" even though the legistative history indicates that Congress only meant gaming in the context of sports gambling. Further, Congress specifically banned contracts in war, terrorism and assassinations, but not elections. Again, if Congress actually wanted election markets banned it would have said so.
With the Supreme Court poised to limit Chevron deference and the Fifth Circuit already having dealt the CFTC several preliminary losses, it seems unwise to continue down this path. I say this a someone who values the role administrative rule making plays in our system, the CFTC's arbitrary approach risks getting administrative rule making powers further curtailed for all agencies through legal precedent.

I am writing to express concern regarding the recent clarification of PredictIt markets as ""gaming."" This reclassification is a misguided notion that diminishes the valuable role predictive markets play in our society.
Predictive markets, particularly those related to elections, are not mere games of chance akin to roulette wheels. They are sophisticated tools that aggregate diverse information and provide insightful data on public sentiment, likely outcomes, and market expectations. These markets have consistently proven to be accurate predictors of election results, often outperforming traditional polling methods.
By classifying these markets as gaming, we risk stifling an important mechanism that contributes to informed decision-making in both the public and private sectors. The participants in these markets are not gamblers seeking quick financial gains but rather informed individuals and institutions analyzing trends and making educated predictions based on a wide array of information sources.
The closure or severe restriction of these markets would result in a significant loss of valuable data and diminish our understanding of electoral dynamics. It is crucial to recognize the distinction between speculative gambling and informed predictive analysis. I urge the CFTC to reconsider its stance and maintain the openness of predictive markets, allowing them to continue their role as vital tools for gauging public opinion and election outcomes.   Moreover, these markets are fun and insightful!

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would prevent U.S. citizens from participating in election futures markets such as PredictIt. As a seasoned political trader, I believe this proposal is misguided and fails to recognize the valuable role these markets play in our democratic process.
When we trade on platforms like PredictIt, we are not merely gambling or guessing. Instead, we carefully analyze complex information, distinguish fact from fiction, and make informed decisions based on our experience, intelligence, and intuition. Together with other traders, we contribute to highly accurate and influential expectations of future events.
The proposed rule wrongly categorizes election futures markets as “gaming,” reducing them to mere chance. In reality, they provide a unique avenue for civic engagement and informed speculation. By participating, we contribute to a more transparent and efficient political landscape.
I urge the CFTC to reconsider this proposal. Rather than stifling innovation and market participation, we should embrace the insights and predictions generated by these platforms. The CFTC’s role should not be that of an “election cop,” but rather a facilitator of fair and transparent markets.
I appreciate your attention to this matter and encourage you to carefully consider the impact of this rule on informed traders and the democratic process.

Hedging against outcomes that would be bad for you is of course another.

It is also worth noting that the study of gambling markets is a useful addition to the realm of political science and its assessment of the veracity of various forms of prediction.
These competing facets of the public interest can best be served by allowing Americans to wager materially insignificant amounts of money on elections through public markets in the same way that they can with friends and neighbors. To ensure that this money truly remains materially insignificant, a viable system would include a hard cap on both money that can be wagered in an individual market, as well as a hard cap on how much aggregate money any individual can wager across markets.

I am currently active on both PredictIt and Kalshi. I strongly oppose the commission's effort to shut down election-based betting markets.
The general public is strongly supportive of regulated betting markets for all types of contracts, from events to sports to politics. There is virtually no public opposition to these types of markets,. Peer-to-peer platforms like PredictIt are fun, safe and provide valuable data for political reporters, academics and researchers. They are a much more reliable tool for understanding the electorate than polls, whose ability to gauge public opinion has been vastly diminished in recent years.
A legal, regulated and taxed political betting market is much safer to consumers than a black market or betting on offshore websites, which is where bettors like me will be forced to go if U.S. political prediction markets are shut down. These types of markets have been legally operating in Europe and other developed countries around the world for decades without negative consequences to consumers or elections. Consumers are better protected in legal, regulated markets that have oversight, integrity units and are subject to American financial and legal protections.
The integrity of elections today is far more threatened by autocratic-leaning political leaders and foreign actors who seek to undermine the fairness and trust in our democratic electoral system. Clamping down on average Americans who seek a platform to trade with one another shuts down healthy political debate and free speech that actually engages voters in the political process. Overhanded government interference is more likely to have a chilling effect on political free speech and civic engagement.
Given the proliferation of gaming, both online and at brick and mortar establishments, over the last 20 years it makes absolutely no sense to impose restrictions on event markets that actually have value to society and engage the public in important issues and topics, not simply the outcome of a sporting event.

73738.0,05/24/2024,89 FR 48968,Kyle,Tauzer,Self,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=73738,"I’d like to express my opposition to the proposed rule put forth for consideration by the CFTC. Many public comments have already been put forth expressing opposition on the basis of the misguided notion that prediction markets constitute gaming, and I fully agree with these points. More specifically, though, I would like to address the question of whether prediction markets related to elections are in the interest of the public. I think there are three primary ways in which they are:
1.) Prediction Markets are a highly efficient and reliable way of aggregating large amounts of conflicting information. In an era of information overload, with low barriers to creating false or misleading media, widespread distrust in the press, and active propaganda from bad actors, there are few sources of completely trustworthy information to draw on. Prediction markets provide a strong incentive for participants to evaluate this information and collate it into a prediction of what events will actually take place. Any spin within a news piece or bias in a poll provides a potential edge for traders to arbitrage away so that only the real probabilities remain. This is why prediction markets are widely used as leading indicators of changing prospects during elections and why academics study them. An example would be treatment of polls by the market. Many successful traders within these markets have sophisticated models to ingest and interpret these polls within the context of historical biases, analysis of their methods, and other factors. Ultimately the probabilities implied within prediction markets are more reliable than the polls themselves. This transparency provides a trustworthy source of information for the public and is in the public’s interest.
2.) Prediction markets generate federal income tax. As with any financial investment, trading results in winners and losers. The winners pay income tax on their gains while the losers have limited ability to write off their losses. The net result is an increase in the taxable income base. I personally have had good success employing arbitrage strategies within prediction markets that result in predictable gains, and have claimed these gains consistently as income on my tax return and paid taxes accordingly. Additionally, my trades are subject to fees from the market provider, who is a non-profit organization. These fees go to operational expenses which provides employment to employees of the market provider, also who provide taxes. The taxation of these activities can then go on to fund any number of government activities which are clearly in the public’s interest.
3.) Prediction markets increase civic engagement. The incentives provided by markets tied to elections are to gather as much information that could determine the outcome in order to gain an edge. Very often, this means performing research on the administrative procedures undertaken by governments and political parties. I have personally witnessed countless examples where traders have attended obscure administrative proceedings, listened to state and local officials give press releases, dug up committee meeting minutes, and gathered information about administrative procedures from all manner of other sources. Traders very regularly watch legislative sessions and track votes in real time. I have personally gained many insights into the way that governments and political parties function, especially when market outcomes come down to very specific and niche questions like the specific parliamentary procedures that will be taken or the timeline of a particular activity. In a world where many people distrust our institutions or have fears of “the deep state”, having people incentivized to dig deep into these administrative procedures and civically engage with government can only be a net positive for the public good.
I note that the CFTC currently is allowing many activities that are classified as legitimate financial derivatives to be traded that do not have these same benefits. Trading in short term options on apps like Robinhood, trading so called “meme stocks”, gambling on fantasy sports, and trading cryptocurrencies all fail to provide meaningful market information, closely resemble gambling, and do nothing to encourage civic engagement. I fail to see how these activities could be justified as being in the public’s interest when election prediction markets are not.
In contrast to these benefits to the public good, I have personally been able to find no damaging factors to the public good caused by prediction markets. Participants are free to participate of their own will. I have serious doubts that any documented cases of “gambling addiction” specific to election prediction markets have ever been identified. I do not believe that these markets are significant enough in size to create financial incentives for election interference, and certainly these incentives pale in comparison to efforts undertaken in lobbying and similar activities. I would urge the committee to inspect any supposed harms to the public interest that are put forward as theories and to inspect whether they actually have any meaningful evidence to support that the harms are real. These markets have been around for, in some cases, decades. Any theoretical harms that they bring about should be readily apparent if they truly exist. A high bar should be set for this.
If the CFTC wishes to further regulate these activities, I would encourage it to instead find ways to maximize the benefits to the public good of prediction markets. Lower fees and fewer caps on volume would improve market efficiency and liquidity, providing more efficient market pricing. Specific guidance on tax treatment of winnings would ensure full capture of the taxable income from all participants. Regulation and oversight of the processes by which market outcomes will be determined and transparency about the specific settlement sources and timelines will improve civic engagement and provide a level playing field. These are legitimate improvements that could be made in the public interest.

Economics 101:
-Don't ban things you don't like; excise tax them instead. Taxes reduce economic activity in that sector and generate revenue for the government. Banning things is unpopular and costs the government money to enforce. One costs money; the other makes money. Banned activities sometimes makes people want to do it more; especially young people. Because everyone wants what they don't have. When they think bans; think taxes instead.
-Companies strive to eliminate competition. It's a government's job to stimulate competition and remove barriers of entry (BOEs) placed by other companies (such as regulatory barriers). Competition lowers cost, increases quality, and increases innovation while Monopolies become lazy and anti-consumer.
-Avoid Tragedy of the Commons situations -- where one company or person benefits to the detriment of many others. This is when you introduce regulations.
-Don't pricefix anything. Just look at Venezuela and how price fixing their oil & gas did for them. Ex: pricefixing housing leads to substantially less new housing. Whenever something is too expensive, increase competition instead by removing Barriers of Entry (BOEs).
Perform a cost-benefit analysis when making decisions:
- Programs that generate more than $1 in value for every $1 invested should be funded more.
- Programs that generate less than $1, no value, or negative value for citizens should have all funding eliminated.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission appears to have little respect for the power of markets, going by their proposal to ban futures contracts on electoral outcomes.
Elections have enormous financial consequences affecting future tax rates, trade policy, regulation and government spending. But instruments such as forward contracts, insurance policies or bets don’t provide effective ways of hedging these risks. Each election affects so many things, and in such complex ways, that — despite the passionate conviction of partisans — they likely have expected present values that net out pretty close to zero for most individuals and companies. This is precisely the kind of exposure that requires futures markets.
The co-conceiver of the Black-Scholes theory of options pricing argued that the point of markets was not to get prices precisely right — that’s impossible to even define — but to coordinate economic activity. If oil refiners are planning based on an assumption of high oil prices and airlines are selling tickets based on low assumed oil prices, there will be inefficiencies and deadweight losses.
Although a company may have no predictable directional exposure to election outcomes, it will have thousands of specific decisions that would change based on election probabilities: how it structures an acquisition for tax purposes, whether it settles a regulatory dispute or fights, what long-term contract terms it offers or where it builds a new facility. If different individuals within the same company, or different companies, are making decisions based on inconsistent probabilities, the economy will run less efficiently than it should.
Do not underestimate the power of futures markets to supercharge economic efficiency. When they were invented in the mid-19th century, they turned a sparsely populated backwater into the global center of the second Industrial Revolution. A century-and-a-quarter later when futures were extended to financial factors, they supported the greatest wealth-creation event in human history and gave birth to the modern global derivatives economy.
Would election futures provide a similar boost? I have no idea, but they might. It would have to begin with fundamental traders — people who can estimate actual probabilities — causing the futures prices to be accepted by economic decision makers. They wouldn’t necessarily have to be better than expert opinions or prediction markets; financial actors are predisposed to trust futures prices over those alternatives. But the prices would have to be accurate enough to be taken seriously.
If financial decision makers started looking at the election futures prices to refine decisions, correlations would emerge between election futures and other prices. These correlations could never be observed without futures markets. Prediction markets and insurance prices are too crude — not updated every second — and are disconnected from economic decisions. Only if economic decisions depend on the listed price is there any chance of estimating correlations.
Next Black’s noise traders come to market. These are traders with no fundamental information about election probabilities but who make money exploiting patterns like trends and correlations. Other noise traders bring tiny scraps of information — too small to influence a directional bet on the election outcome, but large enough to have a predictable short-term effect on prices. These people have no more idea than anyone else who will win the election, but they might know one small thing that, when it comes out, will predictably move the futures price a small amount.
It is the noise traders who make the futures price consistent with all other prices, meaning economic activity is optimally coordinated. Once this happens there may well be hedging demand from fundamental traders — not directional bets on the election but spread trades of election probabilities versus, say, interest rates or currency values, or more complex macro trades involving multiple markets.
You might think that if election futures were so valuable there would be more demand for them. But history argues that it’s very hard to predict which futures contracts will take off and stimulate economic growth, and which ones will not. Exchanges misguess this as often as Hollywood studios make unpopular movies. A successful futures contract requires a series of steps by different types of people, and you can’t know what one group will do until you show it the results of previous group contributions.
Still, economic theory suggests that it’s possible election futures would add significantly to global economic efficiency and growth, so it’s a highly consequential decision for the CFTC to ban them without a trial run. CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam grumbled that he didn’t want the regulator to be an election cop. This is like the Food and Drug Administration commissioner banning a promising new medical technology because he didn’t want the FDA to be a DNA cop.

How are you going to dismiss this? Or are you going to accept it. If you ignore it, I think there's a pretty obvious litigation risk to your reg for violating the APA.
Also, the idea that election markets make you the election cop is laughable for all the obvious reasons that the commissioners said in the open meeting. However, since you are not going to respond to a comment that simply notes that the CFTC's argument about election cop is so specious that the public assumed it was satire (which I think is indeed what the public thinks), I will explain a little more in a precise manner that you are obligated to address under the APA. You ALREADY are the election cop. The CME is clear that elections impact the futures and options that it lists. If someone would manipulate an election, that will impact the CME's markets, which you regulate, and obligate you to investigate the manipulation, including the manipulation of the election. And not only that, you are obligated to investigate even ATTEMPTED manipulation of the market. So the issue is not whether you are the election cop, it's the degree by which you are the election cop. You are OK with a little bit of policing, but not a lot. That is (1) arbitrary and capricious, and (2) an abdication of your job, which is worse.
So, to sum up, and to aid the people who are drafting this final rule, I note that it is clear that election contracts have an economic purpose, I also note that they are distinguished from gaming by this purpose, and I note that the argument that about election cop is incorrect and ignores that there are existing CFTC regulated derivatives that can be manipulated, and attempted to be manipulated, but interfering in elections.  And the fact that election exposure can happen indirectly does not in any way mean that it is not better to have contracts on the events themselves! It was NEVER the posture of the CFTC that ""one product is enough"". The point is to let the market decide what product is best.
Here is the CME's paid advertisement printed in WSJ Business:
By Ivan Castano for CME Group
When Donald Trump clinched the U.S. presidency in November 2016, overnight derivatives trading volumes surged to historical levels.
Fast-forward eight years, and we’re in the midst of another election cycle where market participants are keenly aware that unexpected outcomes are possible. This time, however, it includes not just Washington’s top job but also a change of guard in 65 countries representing roughly 4.2 billion people.
On top of the U.S., the U.K. and Europe are also holding general elections alongside Mexico and other leading emerging markets, such as India. These events, which mark the biggest poll-setting agenda in history, could inject fresh risk and uncertainty into global markets.
In the U.S., for example, trade, immigration and foreign policy could influence economic conditions and voter opinions. Meanwhile, in the U.K., Labour Party candidate Keir Starmer is in a closely contested race with incumbent Rishi Sunak. The winner will inherit a weakening economy hurt by stubborn inflation as rate hikes have largely mirrored those of the U.S. In Europe, meanwhile, the Parliament holds elections in June, fueling new risks that could pressure the euro.
Managing Market Risk
In the U.S., historical stock returns are somewhat muted during election years. Since 1928, the average stock market gain in a presidential election year is 7.5%, slightly lower than the overall average of 8.5%.
In recent years, however, there have been some uneven results, particularly in equity options trading.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, there were 8.1 million equity options on futures contracts traded at CME Group, with 1.7 million changing hands in the run-up to the U.S. midterm elections on November 4. However, in the days leading to the 2020 presidential election there were no volume surges compared to a huge spike immediately following the 2016 vote, when futures and options volumes at CME Group soared to a record 44.5 million contracts the day after the election.
As traders mull positioning around this year’s unique election cycle, equity index options tracking the U.S. stock market could become a focus for market participants. These contracts allow traders to make round-the-clock futures and options trades on the S&P 500, Nasdaq-100, Dow Jones and Russell 2000 indexes.
You can choose to increase or decrease exposures to certain risk events, such as elections, with multiple option expirations available every day of the week.
Brian Burke, Senior Director of Equity Products, CME Group
Options allow traders to take directional positions by either buying (going long) or selling (going short) a particular underlying futures contract at a specified price on or before a specified date. With multiple weekly expiries, they can trade with precision around risk events like an election or a central bank policy announcement.
“With the precision that options provide, you have multiple ways to trade certain events. You can choose to increase or decrease exposures to certain risk events, such as elections, with multiple option expirations available every day of the week,” says Brian Burke, senior director of equity products at CME Group.
Global Trade in Focus
Trade policy is one of the most watched issues in the U.S. and beyond this year, and provides an example for how indexes could respond to election results.
The S&P 500’s top components include a broad swath of U.S. multinationals such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon that have facilities and operations in many countries and could be negatively impacted by trade protectionism. In contrast, the Russell 2000, which is made up of mostly small and midsize U.S. firms, could be less pressured by these policies, according to analysts.
With the index choice available among these key indexes, investors can tailor exposure to risks associated with varying indexes’ sensitivity to U.S. dollar fluctuations, Burke notes. The Russell 2000, for instance, is more sensitive to dollar fluctuations as it’s heavily U.S.-focused, while the S&P 500’s large-corporate constituents typically have diversified revenue streams across several underlying currencies, which render them less exposed to currency market movements.
In this regard, index choice matters. “If investors are looking to gain broad access to large multinational corporations, the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average Index futures and options could provide this risk exposure, whereas for tech-focused exposures, Nasdaq-100 is often the index of choice,” Burke explains. “The Russell 2000 Index provides small-cap, higher beta exposure. So there is a liquid futures or options vehicle available regardless of investor risk management needs.”
Some market analysts say a win by President Joe Biden or former President Trump won’t matter much for the trade outlook.
“For many people the big concern is the U.S. and China and anything that will drive that,” says FX market strategist Ed Moya. “I expect trade tensions to escalate regardless of whether Biden or Trump wins the election and for the deglobalization trend to continue.”
The further you go to the left or the right, the more you can expect hamstrung legislatures that could fall into a lack of consensus, creating increased risks and volatility.
Mark Connors, Research Director, 3iQ
Some futures traders see the equity index response to the U.S. election as an opportunity, with the potential for volatility in November.
Bob Iaccino, co-founder and chief markets strategist at Path Trading Partners, says traders could buy equity index call options to benefit if they expect a volatility spike right before the election. Conversely, they could buy a put spread, a risk-controlled bearish strategy that would benefit if markets turn lower, which Iaccino expects will eventually happen regardless of who wins in November.
Party Politics
Mark Connors, research director at bitcoin ETF manager 3iQ, adds Europe’s increasingly polarized politics are also a major concern.
“Are we going to see a greater movement from the center like we did in Argentina with Javier Milei, or can we see more moderate candidates?” he asks. “The further you go to the left or the right, the more you can expect hamstrung legislatures that could fall into a lack of consensus, creating increased risks and volatility.”
In Mexico, a victory for the incumbent Morena Party and candidate Claudia Sheinbaum could mean Mexico’s relations with the U.S. remain stable, at least from Mexico City’s side.
Latin America’s second-largest economy ships roughly 90% of its goods north of the border. The “nearshoring” phenomenon is expected to transform Mexico’s economy, bolstering U.S. exports to a whopping $600 billion by 2028 from $455 billion last year, according to analysts.
On the other side of the world, India is also in the spotlight, holding general elections set to culminate in June. Incumbent candidate Narendra Modi is expected to win a third term. Since Modi’s right-wing BJP party took power in 2014, the S&P BSE SENSEX index, a bellwether for the Indian stock market, has returned about 13% annually and about 20% over the past year. Still, some investors have cautioned that valuations are overstretched and could be due for a correction.
Soaring Interest in Options Trading
As economic uncertainty has grown in recent years, more traders have entered the options market. Smaller-sized contracts like micro-sized futures have also emerged as tools for sophisticated retail traders. Equity options at CME Group have been gaining traction overall, with more than 1.9 million in average daily trading volume in April, up 76% from a year earlier. On March 10, 2023, a record 2.8 million contracts swapped hands following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, revealing the interest in options for both expected and unexpected market risks.
With elections quickly approaching around the globe, there is a lot for market participants to consider as voters go to the polls this year. Burke says one advantage for traders is knowing the date of the big event.

As a researcher and proponent of “prediction markets”, I believe this proposal undermines the societal benefits these contracts offer. Below, I outline three key points for CFTC Commissioners to consider: the dangers of overregulation leading to a rise in black markets, the public’s right to innovative risk management instruments, and the critical role of prediction markets in information discovery. I also address concerns about the CFTC’s expansion of scope and the financial motives behind these contracts.
Necessity for reasonable government regulation
Balanced regulation is crucial to ensure financial markets protect public interests and consumers. In consumer-facing industries, overregulation can create black markets that lead to the harmful consequences feared of certain instruments coming to fruition (in the case of prediction markets this includes excessive risk taking, perverse incentives, skirting of payout clauses). The CFTC is successfully prohibiting these outcomes today, as they have been cooperative with innovators of this space to this point.
The CFTC’s concerns about investigating manipulation can be mitigated by creating a framework that distinguishes between contract manipulation and event manipulation, similar to the SEC’s approach distinguishing between regulating investor and investor relation practices and business practices.
Public's right to innovative risk management instruments
Insurance products, once met with skepticism, are now crucial for managing various risks – not all of which are ostensibly financial risks at first glance. The innovation of prediction markets offers financial instruments to insure against the volatility of outcomes. Creating a legal barrier to purchasing these instruments that have historically been accessible to large financial institutions forces individuals and small businesses to manage risks they are uncomfortable with that could otherwise be diversified away. Specific to elections, the financial case for these contracts is increasingly clear given the separation between the two major political parties on tax law, climate regulation, and social issues. Furthermore, large financial institutions serviced significant “wagers” on election for years, proving a financial use case for these instruments.
Amplifying truth in discourse
In the age of viral misinformation, news sources prioritize sensationalism over facts. Event contracts incentivize buyers to seek the truth, as their success depends on accurate predictions. Prices as signaling mechanisms can significantly enhance the quality and speed of information available to reporters, academics, and policymakers.
Recommendation

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule entitled ""17 CFR Part 40 Event Contracts."" This proposal would effectively ban individuals in the United States from participating in election futures markets, such as PredictIt, by defining these markets as ""gaming."" This characterization is misguided and fails to recognize the valuable role that prediction markets play in our political process.
First, the CFTC does not have any duty or obligation to regulate elections or their results. The proposal seems, by my read, to be driven by the CFTC’s concern that it could be called to police potential market manipulation in some possible future, and that it generally does not wish to do so. I would like to remind the CFTC that this is not a realistic concern nor is it a valid reason to try to ban election prediction markets in the United States. Elections are run by a multitude of state and local entities that have a diverse collection of systems, monitors, and checks in place to prevent such manipulation from occurring in the first place. The CFTC's focus should be on setting clear and enforceable rules for the market, rather than imposing an outright ban.
Second, the proposal infringes on my rights to engage in political activity. By preventing individuals from participating in election futures markets, the CFTC is limiting our ability to express our political opinions and engage in political discourse. This is an unconstitutional infringement on our rights as American citizens.
Third, recent history has shown that traditional political polling methods involving landline telephones or surveys are often inaccurate and skewed. They have very large margins of error. In contrast, prediction markets have proven to be far more accurate at forecasting election results. These markets provide valuable information that informs political organization activity and speech, and they should be allowed to continue to operate.
In conclusion, I urge the CFTC to reconsider this proposal and to recognize the important role that election futures markets play in our political process. They are not 'gaming' but are an important form of political expression and research discovery. Banning election event contract markets would be a grave disservice to the public and to our democracy. In short, the CFTC should regulate markets and ensure a level playing field by setting reasonable rules. The proposed rules are not reasonable. This proposal should be struck from consideration and should not be implemented.

Goldman Family Office Clients Eye Exotic Puts as Election Hedge
Look-back puts are a way to navigate volatility, Goldman says
Wealth-management executive sees ‘concern across the board’
By Benjamin Stupples
June 4, 2024 at 1:52 PM EDT
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s family office clients are considering exotic options called look-back puts as a way to navigate volatility ahead of this year’s US elections, according to a senior executive at the Wall Street giant.
“There is concern across the board on US elections for family offices,” Sara Naison-Tarajano, global head of private wealth management capital markets, said in a webinar Tuesday. “We’ve been spending time on derivatives strategies like look-back puts.”
The strategy, also known as hindsight options, allows investors to “look back” at the price of the underlying asset over the lifetime of the option and exercise it based on the most beneficial price. They tend to be expensive to execute and trade over the counter.
Economic volatility ahead of the vote is “a risk” to prepare for, but Goldman isn’t changing its view on portfolio allocations based on the strength of the US economy, Naison-Tarajano said.
The comments give an insight into how some of the world’s richest investors are thinking about the November vote, when President Joe Biden will face off against Donald Trump in a rematch of 2020. About half the global adult population will go to the polls at some point in 2024, with elections held in the past few days in India, South Africa and Mexico, and the UK calling a vote for July.
Polls suggest a close race later this year between Biden, 81, and Trump, 77, who is attracting support from a growing number of financial elites despite being found guilty last month in the first criminal trial of a former US president.
As president, Trump broke with decades of precedent by openly attacking Fed Chair Jerome Powell, first for raising interest rates and then for not cutting them further. Trump has made it clear that he wouldn’t reappoint Powell to another term if elected. Biden, by comparison, has taken the traditional hands-off approach toward the Fed even as it raised interest rates at the fastest pace since the early 1980s.
While there’s likely to be a bit of volatility during the election cycle, “the economy remains stable and growth remains stable,” Naison-Tarajano said. “I can’t imagine that really changing.”

I created ElectionBettingOdds.com in 2015, a journalistic resource that aggregates betting odds from both US and overseas prediction markets. The site has been accessed by more than 20 million unique users, highlighting that Americans believe the information generated by prediction markets are valuable and worth their time.
The proposed regulation would reduce the quality of information presented on my site, and throughout journalistic reports on everything from elections to the academy awards.
Your proposal would clearly be in violation of the plain text of the law, as elections and award contests are clearly not ""gaming"" in any kind of plain-English sense of the word. Try doing a scientific survey and ask people if elections are ""gaming.""
Further, congress clearly did not intend to prohibit election trading with the law, which was passed at a time when election trading existed on sites like Intrade.com, where it was widely cited in the media, including ABC News, the New York Time, the Wall Street Journal, and many more; if congress had intended to ban election trading with Dodd Frank, they would have said so, rather than banning specifically ""terrorism, assassination, war, gaming..."" The CFTC risks wasting the time and money of its own lawyers, as well as those of many entrepreneurs, by acting beyond the powers Congress gave it.
Your proposal notes that the CFTC does not have the resources to make a decision about every possible market. I suggest that, instead of solving that by banning election and award markets, as the proposed regulation would do, you solve it by *allowing all* election markets and similar. It also will not require work on your end if everything is legal. Instead, focus your resources on banning the things Congress actually asked to be banned: (""terrorism, assassination, war, gaming..."")
Returning to the public interest point, there is widespread interest among the general public in predicting the outcomes of elections, because such information helps people and businesses plan for the future.
Thank you for your time, and I hope you will reconsider this proposed regulation.

They provide the best known mechanism for ordinary people to predict what is going to happen and plan around it.
My impression is that this rule stems from an understandable desire to protect against the manipulation of elections. However, banning public prediction markets will not protect elections at all.
1. Many people are already highly interested in the outcome of elections. Billions of dollars already hang on these outcomes, and a few nerds will not suddenly care more than multinational corporations, radical partisans, and billionaires. The notion that the existence of legal prediction markets will allow traders unprecedentedly large incentives to manipulate in politics without being noticed by regulators is absurd.
2. There is a concern that moneyed interests will bid up the prices of candidates they want to have win. This is highly unlikely. True, in a very small, low-liquidity election, a large bet by a market manipulator could plausibly raise the price for a while until a lot of other traders noticed the inefficiency. However, it’s difficult to imagine that millions of dollars would not be better spent on directly advertising and campaigning rather than maybe raising the low-value signal of the probability on a prediction market. Most voters don’t care about prediction markets at all.
3. There is a concern that the market prices of liquid prediction markets will be used to convince voters not to vote in elections where one candidate is already favored, or to argue against certain candidates if, for instance, one primary candidate is considered by the market as less likely to win in a general election. This argument is antithetical to a culture of free speech. People already make arguments that people should vote based on their subjective probabilities of winning. Banning prediction markets because they would provide somewhat more objective evidence for those kinds of arguments is akin to banning polls on the same grounds. Such a justification would violate the First Amendment and a broader commitment to free speech.
4. Prediction markets are most analogous to polls, another method of aggregating public opinion. The government cannot use the grounds of potential misinformation to ban either. If anyone wants to make a fake or manipulated poll in an attempt to sway an election, they fall squarely under the protection of the First Amendment. The same holds for prediction markets, which are much harder and more expensive to rig. They are especially so if regulated by the CFTC.
I focused on elections, but the case for banning prediction markets on ordinary events like Rotten Tomato movie scores and the outcome of award shows is even weaker.
The word ‘gaming’ clearly was not meant to apply to games, not everything under the sun. The philosophical outlook that all of life is one big game is charming, but not the sort of thing the US government can adopt as its official position. Meanwhile, sports betting is already legal in every state.
There is a small but committed community of people who enjoy using prediction markets. They spend a lot of time thinking about the future, and the sum of their thinking is expressed in a market. Some make money, others, lose it, but in the process they provide valuable public information for everyone.
Banning prediction markets for such weak reasons is a slap in the face to this community.

Here’s how the dollar is tracking Biden’s chances of victory in November
Story by Vivien Lou Chen
Though the U.S. presidential election is still five months away, analysts are continuing to weigh in on how the race could impact financial markets.
One example comes from Deutsche Bank strategist Alan Ruskin: In a note on Sunday, he wrote that since the start of 2024, there’s been a 73% correlation between the ICE U.S. Dollar Index and the probability of a victory for President Joe Biden as implied by PredictIt, the New Zealand-based online prediction market.
“A strong economy is Biden positive and probably USD positive through the rates channel,” Ruskin wrote. “But a stronger economy that keeps inflation expectations elevated would almost certainly be negative for risky assets and Biden’s chances, even as it might support the USD, most obviously versus the high-beta currencies.”
Meanwhile, the chances of a victory for former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee, are also likely to be viewed as USD positive, although “mainly by default because the geopolitics and trade frictions are negative for the CNY (Chinese onshore yuan) and EUR (euro) particularly, and to a lesser degree MXN (Mexico peso),” the strategist added. “This ‘USD-positive-by-default view’ may get watered down, depending on how much the Trump campaign overtly talks about the need for a weaker USD, or attacks Fed independence.”
Trump’s chances of winning the White House race appear to have declined since the verdict, according to polls. However, PredictIt is still pointing to almost even odds of a victory by either candidate, and strategists are still trying to figure out the possible market implications of the election’s outcome.

I am writing to you as a Software Engineer who reads news alongside prediction markets to understand how accurate or real the headlines actually are to express my views on the importance of election contracts, award shows and contests, and sports contracts in the regulated marketplace.
My unique perspective allows me to see firsthand how prediction markets can serve as a valuable tool for verifying the reliability of news and forecasts. These markets generate significant information that can validate or challenge the narrative presented by media outlets.
As someone who believes the definition of 'gaming' is both wrong and overbroad, I argue that election contracts are essential because they provide a mechanism for hedging and price discovery. The assertion that these contracts exist predominantly to enable gambling is not credible and ignores substantial data and evidence highlighting their economic utility and public interest value.
Furthermore, regulated activity in this space ensures market integrity and fosters partnerships with reputable institutions, such as the collaboration between Kalshi and Susquehanna International Group. This regulation not only secures the market but also enhances market liquidity and confidence.
In light of the recent proposals by the CFTC, I would like to highlight that the current interpretation undermines the potential benefits these contracts offer for risk management and market transparency. The definition of 'gaming' being used is incorrect and overly broad, which does not account for the legitimate economic functions these contracts serve. Ignoring this data will likely drive market activity offshore to unregulated environments, which poses greater risks to market participants.
Additionally, I am concerned about the CFTC’s approach to this issue. Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to engage more actively with stakeholders to understand the practical implications of these regulations. It is essential to consider the detailed comments provided by various industry experts and ask substantive questions to gain comprehensive insights.
Therefore, I respectfully request the Commission to hold a roundtable discussion, extend the comment period, and vote no on the proposed event contract rule. This will allow for more comprehensive feedback from the industry and ensure that all perspectives are adequately considered.
In response to the CFTC's questions, I believe that additional types of event contracts should be explicitly identified by the Commission in the non-exclusive list of contract types that would generally fall outside contracts that “exist predominantly to enable gambling.” These could include contracts based on macroeconomic indices or measures like tax rates (e.g., corporate and capital gains tax rates). The availability of bets or wagers at gaming venues should not be a relevant factor in determining whether an event contract constitutes 'gaming.' Moreover, staking something of value on the outcome of a political contest is not similar to gaming and should not be considered as such.
In conclusion, the benefits of election contracts, award shows and contests, and sports contracts in generating valuable market information far outweigh the purported risks. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a constructive dialogue on how best to regulate these essential contracts.

I am writing to you as a resident of Texas who values prediction markets, event contracts trading, and particularly in the context of election contracts, to express my views on the importance of these contracts in a regulated marketplace.
As someone who would use prediction markets to hedge risks associated with election outcomes, I believe these contracts are essential because they provide a mechanism for individuals and businesses to manage their exposure to political risks. This is particularly important as the outcomes of elections can significantly impact economic conditions and policy decisions that affect various sectors. Wall Street has access to these types of tools and I believe Main Street should have similar access.
In light of the recent proposal by the CFTC, I would like to highlight that the Commission's current interpretation of the law undermines the potential benefits these contracts offer for risk management. Further, the definition of 'gaming' proposed by the CFTC is overly broad and mischaracterizes the nature of these contracts. Additionally, labeling election contracts as akin to 'gaming' ignores the extensive data demonstrating their utility. Finally, the CFTC has not demonstrated any material harm or concern from these markets other than speculation and fact-less statements.
I am also very concerned about the potential of this rule making for driving this trading activity offshore, where it would be less regulated (or not regulated at all!) and more susceptible to fraud and manipulation. This is not what you should want to happen. We should want regulated and legal activity to happen onshore, with government oversight. Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to engage more actively with stakeholders to understand the practical implications of these regulations.
Therefore, I respectfully request the Commission to extend the comment period to allow for more comprehensive feedback from the industry and ensure that all perspectives are adequately considered. The 60-day period for this Event Contract proposa is rushed and is not sufficient time for this rule to be considered from all who want to weigh in.
In response to the CFTC's question in the proposal, I believe it is crucial to consider the hedging and price-basing utility of these contracts when evaluating their public interest. These contracts provide significant value by allowing market participants to hedge against political risks and generate valuable information that benefits the broader public. Everyone will benefit from these markets.
Event contracts as an asset class are legal, regulated, and safe, and they generate valuable information for the public. Election contracts would be no different. The CFTC should reconsider its stance and work closely with stakeholders to develop a regulatory framework that supports these contracts while addressing any legitimate concerns. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to an extended comment period.

I am writing to you as a market enthusiast and a recent college graduate who enjoys outdoor activities. I want to express my views on the importance of election contracts, awards shows and contests, and sports contracts in the regulated marketplace.
As someone who actively follows these markets, I believe event contracts are essential because they provide legal, regulated, and safe platforms for trading. These contracts allow individuals and businesses to hedge against risks and gain insights from market-generated information. This regulation not only secures the market but also allows for partnerships with reputable institutions, such as the recent collaboration between Kalshi and Susquehanna International Group, enhancing market liquidity and confidence.

The election cop argument is not credible, and the definition of gaming is wrong and overbroad. Such interpretations will drive activity offshore and ignore valuable data that supports the utility of these contracts.
Additionally, I am concerned about the lack of engagement with stakeholders. Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to engage more actively with stakeholders to understand the practical implications of these regulations. This includes considering comments, asking questions, and doing the hard work to understand these markets.
Therefore, I respectfully request the Commission to extend the comment period, hold a roundtable discussion, and vote no on the proposed event contract rule. These steps will allow for more comprehensive feedback from the industry and ensure that all perspectives are adequately considered.
In response to the CFTC's questions:
1. Additional types of event contracts that should be identified include contracts based on macroeconomic indicators such as tax rates (e.g., corporate and capital gains tax rates). These indices or measures are relevant for contracts that exist predominantly to enable gambling.
2. The Commission's proposed definition of the term 'gaming' should be reconsidered. Activities that constitute gaming should be clearly distinguished from legitimate hedging activities. Staking something of value on the outcome of a political contest is not similar to gaming and should not be treated as such.
3. Contracts involving political contests do not involve activities similar to war, terrorism, assassination, or activities unlawful under any Federal or State law. Therefore, these contracts should not be deemed contrary to the public interest.
4. Hedging and price-basing utility should be considered when evaluating whether a contract is contrary to the public interest. These utilities are crucial for assessing the legitimate economic purposes of the contracts.
5. Contracts involving terrorism, assassination, and war should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if they raise public interest concerns.
6. Contracts involving activities unlawful under federal or state law should be scrutinized to ensure they do not raise public interest concerns.
7. Contracts involving gaming should be evaluated to determine if they provide legitimate hedging utilities and should not be dismissed solely based on their association with gaming.
8. A 30-day effective date after the final rule amendments' publication may not provide sufficient time for compliance. A 60-day implementation period would be more appropriate to allow for the orderly cessation of trading in impacted event contracts.
In conclusion, event contracts serve a clear economic purpose and provide significant benefits to traders and the market. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a constructive dialogue on how best to regulate these essential contracts.

My name is Joel Litvin. I currently run Calumet Consulting, LLC, a sports consulting firm, and teach sports management at Columbia University. I am the former President, League Operations (2006-15) and General Counsel (2000-2006) of the National Basketball Association where I worked for 27 years.
My work has made me intimately familiar with the economics of the professional sports industry in the United States, including the commercial risks faced by businesses and individuals that operate in the professional sports ecosystem – teams and team owners, corporate sponsors, media companies, fans, stadium owners and operators, team and stadium lenders, product licensees, etc.
These sports industry participants face economic risks arising from the on-field performance of teams and athletes – the better the performance, the more popular the team or athlete, which generates revenues for teams and businesses connected to professional sports by raising attendance levels and television viewership. The opposite is true as well – underperformance of teams and players can drive down attendance and viewership, which, for example, has a knock-on effect on the revenues of team sponsors and telecasters.
These risks could be mitigated by futures contracts that the Commission’s proposed rules would prohibit. Contracts that are based on measures that comprise multiple performance inputs of a team or athlete over multiple games would provide significant hedging and risk management benefits to numerous industry participants who are exposed to economic consequences from team and athlete performance. These contracts would be based on continuously priced measures that reflect team and player performances in multiple contests as opposed to the kind of binary payoffs on individual contests that characterize “sports gaming” as commonly understood, and which the Commission seems most concerned with.
For example:
•	Noncontrolling Team Owners -- Given the growing value of professional sports teams and league rules requiring that a single individual control all business and competitive decisions involving a team, minority team owners – including institutional investors such as private equity firms that leagues have recently permitted into their ownership ranks – own purely passive positions in professional sports teams worth billions of dollars in the aggregate. These minority owners face the same commercial risks as teams and controlling owners but have limited ability to manage these risks. For example, a team’s controlling owner might embark on a long-term rebuilding strategy that sacrifices winning (and revenues) in the short term as the team seeks to develop younger talent and accumulate high draft picks. Futures contracts based on continuously priced measures of team performance over time (not in a single game) would enable minority owners to hedge this risk, without raising the Commission’s concerns about sports gaming.
•	Corporate Sponsors – Brands that pay significant sums to align with teams and athletes face myriad commercial risks that could be managed, in part, through the use of futures contracts based on continuously priced measures of team and player performance. For example, a team sponsor that spends on advertising and promotion based on assumptions about the team’s live and television audiences could hedge against those audiences falling short of projections because of, say, the team’s unexpected subpar performance on the field.
•	Media Companies -- Telecasters that make large rights payments to teams run the risk of underperformance by the teams and/or their star players, which hurts ratings, reduces advertising revenue, and diminishes the leverage of regional sports networks in carriage negotiations with distributors. Futures contracts based on multi-game performance measures for players and teams could be used by telecasters to mitigate these risks.
•	Fans – Individual consumers and companies invest in teams through the purchase of season tickets for various tiers of stadium seating and luxury suites. These tickets are either used by the season ticket holder, or resold through secondary ticketing markets such as Ticketmaster and StubHub. The season ticket holder faces the risk that the value of their tickets declines because of the poor performance of the team and/or injury or subpar performance of a star player. Ticket prices on secondary markets generally rise when a team is winning and can drop precipitously when a team underperforms or a star player is injured or traded. These risks could be mitigated through the use of futures contracts on a continuously priced measure of team or athlete performance.
As illustrated above, futures contracts based on team and athlete performance in multiple contests would have extensive economic utility in the $150 billion U.S. professional sports industry. Businesses and individuals of all kinds stake enormous sums on the performance of professional teams and athletes in sports contests over time. It would be manifestly in the public interest to allow these participants to hedge the risks they face through futures contracts based on continuously priced measures comprising multiple metrics over multiple contests. Further, these contracts would not implicate the sports gambling concerns expressed by the Commission because they would not be based on individual contests with binary payoffs.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,My name is Joel Litvin;I currently run;I am the former President;My work has made me intimately familiar,"Despite the metadata indicating an organizational affiliation, the comment is primarily written in the first person, detailing personal experience and perspective, and focuses on the author's individual expertise and observations."
73790.0,06/20/2024,89 FR 48968,Keith,Middlemark,,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=73790,"To the Commissioners of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),
I am writing to express my profound concerns regarding the recent regulatory actions taken by the CFTC concerning event contracts. It is my firm belief that event contracts fall outside the appropriate scope of the CFTC's regulatory purview and that the Commission's recent steps to regulate these markets represent a significant overreach.
Historically, the CFTC's mandate has been to oversee commodity futures and options markets, ensuring their integrity and stability. Event contracts, which often relate to political outcomes or other non-commodity-related events, do not fit neatly into the traditional categories of financial instruments that the CFTC is tasked with regulating. Their nature and purpose are fundamentally different from the commodities markets that the Commission was established to oversee.
Moreover, this regulatory expansion appears to be politically motivated, coinciding suspiciously with the emergence of event market data that indicated favorable outcomes for former President Trump over President Biden. Such timing raises concerns about whether the regulatory action is being driven by political considerations rather than a genuine need to oversee these markets. If event markets are showing results that are politically unfavorable to the current administration, intervening to regulate them might be perceived as an attempt to suppress these signals, which undermines public trust in regulatory institutions.
Event markets serve a valuable role in providing real-time insights into public sentiment and expectations, often reflecting the collective wisdom of a diverse group of participants. Traditional polling methods have long been criticized for their potential biases and inaccuracies. Event markets offer an alternative by aggregating the opinions and information of participants who have a financial stake in the outcomes. This can lead to a more accurate and nuanced understanding of public opinion and electoral probabilities. By moving to regulate these markets, the CFTC risks diminishing the quality and availability of this innovative source of information.
In conclusion, I urge the CFTC to reconsider its stance on event contracts. The regulation of these markets does not align with the Commission's primary responsibilities and threatens to undermine an important tool for gauging public sentiment. The overreach into this domain not only deviates from the CFTC's core mission but also has the potential to erode trust in both the markets and the regulatory process itself.
Thank you for considering my concerns. I hope the CFTC will take these points into account and refrain from further actions that could stifle the beneficial contributions of event markets.

Keith Middlemark",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,"I am writing to express my profound concerns; It is my firm belief; Such timing raises concerns; I urge the CFTC to reconsider; Thank you for considering my concerns; Sincerely, Keith Middlemark","The comment consistently uses first-person pronouns and expresses personal opinions and concerns, indicating an individual perspective despite the formal tone."

I am writing to you as a 31-year-old market data/forecast user and market enthusiast to express my views on the importance of election contracts, awards shows and contests, and sports contracts in the regulated marketplace.
As a market enthusiast, I closely follow various market activities and utilize market data to make informed decisions. This relevance is particularly significant when considering event contracts, as they provide a legal, regulated, and safe environment for trading. For example, election contracts offer a unique way to hedge and manage risks associated with political outcomes, which can significantly impact various industries and economic conditions.
Event contracts are essential because they are legal, regulated, and safe. These contracts are meticulously overseen by regulatory bodies, ensuring that participants are protected from fraud and market manipulation. The regulation of such activities not only secures the market but also allows for partnerships with reputable institutions, enhancing market liquidity and confidence.
Furthermore, regulated activity in this space ensures that markets generate valuable information. This regulation not only secures the market but also allows for partnerships with reputable institutions, such as the recent collaboration between Kalshi and Susquehanna International Group, enhancing market liquidity and confidence.
In light of the recent proposals by the CFTC, I would like to highlight that the election cop argument is not credible, and the definition of gaming is wrong and overbroad. The current interpretation undermines the potential benefits these contracts offer for risk management and market transparency. Additionally, driving such activities offshore would ignore the valuable data generated by these markets and reduce the oversight and safety that come with regulation.
Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to engage more actively with stakeholders, consider comments, ask questions, and do the hard work to understand these markets. By doing so, the CFTC can ensure that all perspectives are adequately considered.
Therefore, I respectfully request the Commission to vote no on the proposed event contract rule to allow for more comprehensive feedback from the industry and ensure that all perspectives are adequately considered.
In conclusion, event contracts are legal, regulated, and safe, providing significant benefits by generating valuable market information. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a constructive dialogue on how best to regulate these essential contracts.
Thank you for your consideration.

I have been a member of PredictIt for over 8 years without any detrimental experience.
I oppose the proposed rule for the following reasons:
1) PredictIt is approaching its 10 year anniversary, making it one of the biggest and longest running prediction markets in American history.
2) For people who don’t know, PredictIt works by drawing in thousands of individuals who buy shares of a contract (such as “Will Donald Trump win the 2024 US presidential election?”) at a price between $0.00 and $1. Each contract will resolve for either $0 or $1. The number of cents per contract (the current price) reflects the probability that the contract will resolve as Yes. In effect, this is a crowdsourced probabilistic forecast.
3) PredictIt trades are capped at $850 per user per contract. This helps to keep the market small-scale and ensures that wealthy individuals cannot manipulate markets. This protects the sanctity of the crowdsourcing process, and differentiates PredictIt from other financial markets that are dominated by hedge funds and institutional investors.
4) In its 10 year history, PredictIt has made these crowdsourced probabilistic forecasts available to the public, and makes anonymized trade data available to researchers who study patterns in the data.

Opinion markets and purchases of options on opinion resolution (i.e., elections) are not games in which each purchase of an option is responded by an opponent's counter action. In fact, the opinion markets are ""valuation"" markets in which each of the binary positions in the market has a higher or lower value as opinions change within a changing national social and economic context.  The values change in response to the participants' perceptions of the outcome likelihood of important election events.
Unlike gambling on repeated rounds of sports events, the election markets provide economic signals about important community-determined future social outcomes.  Because the signals are developed from the opinion holders' willingness to pay to support their positions with money, the signals from the prices are currently more reliable than sample-based polls in which there is no monetary incentive for poll respondents to be truthful.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that classifies election futures markets as ""gaming."" This mischaracterization overlooks the critical role these markets play in encouraging informed and engaged voting.
Prediction markets like PredictIt have demonstrated their value in fostering a well-informed electorate. When money is at stake, participants are incentivized to seek out factual, up-to-date information to make informed trading decisions. This is not a game of chance; it is a disciplined exercise in gathering and analyzing political data, which enhances the overall quality of public discourse.
Comparing prediction markets to stock markets further illustrates the flaw in labeling them as gambling. Both markets require participants to research, analyze, and forecast future events to make informed decisions. Just as stock traders evaluate companies' performance and market conditions, prediction market participants assess political events and public opinion. If election futures markets are to be deemed gambling, then by the same logic, stock markets should be classified as gambling as well—a notion that is clearly unreasonable and would never be accepted.
By treating these markets as gambling, the CFTC undermines a valuable tool that helps counter misinformation and encourages civic engagement. PredictIt, with its cap on individual investments, has shown that it can operate with integrity and contribute positively to the public understanding of political events.

PredictIt is approaching its 10 year anniversary, making it one of the biggest and longest running prediction markets in American history.
PredictIt works by drawing in thousands of individuals who buy shares of a contract (such as “Will Donald Trump win the 2024 US presidential election?”) at a price between $0.00 and $1. Each contract will resolve for either $0 or $1. The number of cents per contract (the current price) reflects the probability that the contract will resolve as Yes. In effect, this is a crowdsourced probabilistic forecast.
PredictIt trades are capped at $850 per user per contract. This helps to keep the market small-scale and ensures that wealthy individuals cannot manipulate markets. This protects the sanctity of the crowdsourcing process, and differentiates PredictIt from other financial markets that are dominated by hedge funds and institutional investors.
In its 10 year history, PredictIt has made these crowdsourced probabilistic forecasts available to the public, and makes anonymized trade data available to researchers who study patterns in the data.
Research shows that these forecasts are generally accurate and are generally more accurate than polling, especially earlier in a race. This is because polls are a snapshot in time, but prediction markets allow users to weigh the effect of factors (the criminal conviction of a presidential candidate, for example) that have not yet fully resonated with voters.
Because of its accuracy, PredictIt data is widely cited by media, campaigns, and financial institutions, and even appears on the Bloomberg Terminal.
The research also shows that PredictIt makes users more likely to seek out factual information about current events. Users who build trading strategies around factual events tend to do better than those who trade based on their ideologies or misinformation. In an era where both liberal and conservative commentators are alarmed at the public’s acceptance of fake news and misinformation, these markets are one of the few mechanisms left for incentivizing the accumulation of true and accurate information (an antidote to fake news).
Despite the inherent public good that these markets offer, the CFTC is currently on the warpath against prediction markets. The CFTC is both aiming to shut down PredictIt (and has repeatedly been stopped by courts, including the second highest court in the land) and is proposing a rule that would ban election markets in the United States, perhaps permanently.

It's highly likely that poll taking without the underpinning of minor gaming is unreliable and untrustworthy.  Nor do I believe that this program would work if there was significant amounts of money involved.  In this instance, although the money is incidental, it very much produces decisions on the part of those members involved that are based on their true beliefs concerning the outlook of an election matter, and not a statement by the person being polled that he or she believes the poll taker is seeking.  It is literally an arms length transaction not for the purpose of making money but to participate in a process that helps us all to understand the beliefs and views of others regarding such a vital matter.

I am writing to express my opposition to the proposed rule by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that would prohibit individuals in the United States from participating in election futures markets, including platforms like Predictit.org.
Election futures markets serve a valuable role in our democratic process by providing insights into public sentiment and expectations about election outcomes. These markets aggregate diverse opinions and have been shown to be accurate predictors of electoral results, often more so than traditional polling methods. By allowing market participants to trade based on their knowledge and expectations, these platforms contribute to a more informed electorate and a more transparent electoral process.
Furthermore, platforms like Predictit.org operate under strict regulatory frameworks, ensuring that the markets are fair, transparent, and free from manipulation. The participation in these markets is voluntary and involves personal risk management, similar to other forms of financial markets which are regulated but not prohibited.
Banning election futures markets would stifle innovation and limit the tools available for understanding public opinion. It would also set a concerning precedent for the regulation of predictive markets in general. Instead of an outright ban, I urge the CFTC to consider regulatory measures that ensure the integrity and transparency of these markets without eliminating them entirely.
Moreover, restricting access to these platforms raises significant constitutional concerns. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech, and participation in election futures markets is a form of expressive conduct that conveys opinions and predictions about political outcomes. By banning these markets, the CFTC would infringe upon individuals’ rights to free speech and their ability to participate in public discourse.
Additionally, the Fifth Amendment protects against government overreach and ensures that any regulatory action must be justified and not arbitrary. The proposed rule appears to lack sufficient justification for such a broad prohibition and fails to consider less restrictive alternatives that could address any potential issues.
I believe in the importance of these platforms for fostering a well-informed public and enhancing the democratic process. I respectfully request that the CFTC reconsider the proposed rule and seek alternatives that address concerns without resorting to a blanket prohibition.

If I think that it is unlikely that Rubio is the VP pick, but Rubio shares are trading high, then I buy ""No"" shares in predicting his failure to achieve that, similar to how traders ""short"" stocks that they think are overvalued by others in the market.

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the proposed rule that would classify election futures markets like PredictIt as ""gaming"" and effectively ban them in the United States. As a participant in these markets, I believe this proposal is misguided and fails to recognize the significant value these platforms provide.
PredictIt has operated for nearly a decade, establishing itself as one of the most prominent and long-running prediction markets in American history. Its model of crowdsourced probabilistic forecasting has proven to be a valuable tool for researchers, media outlets, financial institutions, and the general public.
Several key points demonstrate why PredictIt and similar markets should not be classified as gaming:
1) Accuracy and public benefit: Research has shown that these markets often provide more accurate forecasts than traditional polling, especially early in election cycles. This accuracy stems from participants weighing various factors that may not yet be reflected in polls. As a result, PredictIt data is widely cited by media, campaigns, and even appears on the Bloomberg Terminal.
2) Promoting factual information: Studies indicate that participation in these markets encourages users to seek out factual information about current events. In an era of increasing concern about misinformation, these platforms incentivize the accumulation and use of accurate information.
3) Research value: PredictIt makes anonymized trade data available to researchers, contributing to our understanding of political forecasting and decision-making.
4) Responsible limits: The $850 cap per user per contract ensures that the market remains small-scale and prevents manipulation by wealthy individuals or institutions.
5) Educational impact: Participation in these markets can increase engagement with and understanding of political processes and current events.
Classifying these markets as mere ""gaming"" ignores the time, research, and informed decision-making that participants invest in their trades. Unlike sports betting or roulette, success in these markets is largely based on knowledge and analysis of complex political and social factors.
I urge the CFTC to reconsider this proposal and recognize the unique value and public good offered by election futures markets like PredictIt. These platforms serve as important tools for forecasting, research, and public engagement with the political process. Banning them would be a significant loss for public discourse and our understanding of political dynamics.

73839.0,06/26/2024,89 FR 48968,michael,Colopy,Self,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=73839,"Dear Chairman Behnam,
I am writing to you today as someone with a great love for commodities trading, a vibrant market that fosters immense economic agility and shapes global finance. The purpose of my letter is to dive into the contentious issue of election futures, and specifically, the recent proposal from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to categorize them as gambling or gaming. I wish to highlight the potential ramifications and provide a different perspective, one that underscores the utility and necessity of election futures, while also addressing the concerns that have been raised.
Election futures, at their core, bear a striking resemblance to the time-honored practice of commodities futures trading. In the global commodities markets, futures contracts are routinely used to manage the risk associated with volatile price movements of commodities like soybeans, oil, and gold. These contracts lock in prices today for future transactions, thus driving price stability and enabling users to hedge against possible future price changes. To illustrate, a farmer may use futures contracts to lock in a price for his crop weeks or months before harvest, protecting himself from a potential drop in prices.
Similar to how futures trading harnesses the predictive power of the market to manage risk and uncertainty, election futures incorporate a greater breadth of information, knowledge, and collective wisdom to predict an electoral outcome. It is not, as has been proposed, anything like gambling. Instead, it is a rigorous analytical exercise that requires a deep understanding of political dynamics, public sentiment, demographic shifts, media influence, economic indicators, and historical voting patterns, among other factors. Election futures trading is not so much about luck as it is about knowledge, expertise, and the ability to make sense of a complex web of information.
In addition, election futures have the capacity to provide a unique, market-driven evaluation of political sentiment that's more dynamic and potentially more accurate than traditional polling. This more fluid indicator could serve to enhance public understanding of the political landscape and contribute to deeper democratic engagement. This is in stark contrast to conventional polls, which are often plagued by bias, methodological flaws, and a failure to accurately capture the pulse of the population as a whole. As such, the idea of classifying election futures as gambling risks ignoring these nuanced benefits.
Furthermore, it is important to consider how other nations engage with election futures. For instance, in the United Kingdom, political betting markets have long been a part of their democratic process. In fact, these markets have often been more accurate predictors of election outcomes than polls or pundits. It is not seen as gambling in a pejorative sense, but rather, as a sophisticated analysis of political dynamics. We have the opportunity to adopt a similar view here in the United States, bringing us in line with international norms, practices, and perceptions.
I understand the CFTC's concerns regarding the potential influence of election futures on electoral integrity. The CFTC is concerned that large-scale trading on election outcomes might unduly influence the process itself. However, there are ways to mitigate the risks while preserving the utility of election futures. One potential solution could be imposing a cap on election futures contracts, similar to the campaign finance thresholds set by the Federal Election Commission. This approach could ensure that the market remains a tool for informed analysis, rather than a means of manipulation.
By viewing election futures as a sophisticated extension of commodities trading, rather than a form of gambling, we can preserve their civic benefits and allow them to serve public interest. I implore the CFTC to reconsider their position and recognize the potential for election futures to contribute to a more informed and engaged electorate.
I am happy to continue this dialogue and offer more insights on this critical issue at any time. I believe that our collective wisdom and deep understanding of both commodities trading and election futures can lead us to an equitable solution.
Your time and attention to this matter are greatly appreciated.

By allowing individuals to trade contracts tied to future events, these markets efficiently incorporate diverse knowledge and perspectives, often producing more accurate predictions than traditional forecasting methods.
Expanding access to properly regulated prediction markets could yield substantial benefits for businesses, policymakers, researchers, and the general public. These markets can provide early warning signals for potential risks, help allocate resources more efficiently, and improve decision-making processes. Furthermore, prediction markets promote engagement with important issues and incentivize individuals to seek out and act on accurate information. To fully realize these benefits, the regulatory framework should be updated to provide clarity and reduce barriers to entry for prediction market operators and participants.
I urge the CFTC to take a proactive approach in developing guidelines that protect market integrity and consumers while fostering innovation in this space. This could include creating a regulatory sandbox for new prediction market models, establishing clear rules around contract design and risk management, and collaborating with academic researchers to study the impacts and potential applications of these markets. By embracing prediction markets, the CFTC has an opportunity to position the U.S. as a leader in harnessing the wisdom of crowds for public benefit.

I am writing to you as a small business owner in San Francisco who primarily uses market data/forecasts. My aim is to express my views on the importance of election contracts in the regulated marketplace.
As a business owner, I proactively use the predictive value that Kalshi’s markets provide to anticipate economic and political shifts (that are caused by who is elected or who is leading the polls in an election race) that oftentimes end up impacting my own business. This tool is great because the predicted political and economic shifts they provide helps me make strategic decisions that ensure my business continues to grow and adapt. This is crucial for small business owners like myself who need to navigate the uncertainties of economic and political landscapes.
I would like to highlight that the CFTC's election cop argument is not credible, and the current interpretation undermines the potential benefits these contracts offer for the predictive value, market transparency, and ability to manage risk associated with one's own finances and the finances of their business.
I am also concerned about the general approach of the CFTC. Effective regulation requires a collaborative approach, and I urge the CFTC to ask questions, do the hard work to understand these markets, and engage more actively with stakeholders to understand the practical implications of these regulations. Thus, I request that the CFTC extend the comment period an additional 60 days.

1. The proposed definition of gaming should be refined to clearly exclude activities that have substantial economic or commercial relevance. For example, staking something of value on the outcome of a political contest is not similar to gaming, as it involves significant research and analysis rather than mere chance.
2. Additional types of event contracts that should be explicitly identified include those related to major economic indicators and policy changes, as they have significant macroeconomic impacts and are not primarily for gambling purposes. Tax rates, such as corporate and capital gains tax rates, should be considered as macroeconomic measures.
3. Contracts involving political contests should not be categorized similarly to contracts involving war, terrorism, or unlawful activities, as they serve different purposes and do not have the same adverse public interest concerns.
4. Hedging and price-basing utility should be considered when evaluating whether a contract is contrary to the public interest. These utilities can be assessed by examining the contract's ability to provide risk management and price discovery benefits.
5. The proposed public interest determination for contracts involving gaming should consider whether the contract has substantial economic or commercial relevance, distinguishing between pure gambling and legitimate hedging activities.

I deeply value platforms like Kalshi that push the boundaries of traditional trading. Event contracts, such as those for entertainment awards, offer a unique and profitable way to engage with the market, setting them apart from more conventional trading instruments. These contracts allow traders to capitalize on their knowledge and insights, thus contributing significantly to market efficiency and diversity.
The CFTC’s proposal to ban these contracts is shortsighted and undermines the substantial benefits they bring to the financial ecosystem. Entertainment award contracts, for instance, provide a fascinating intersection of finance, popular culture, and predictive analytics. By allowing market participants to trade on the outcomes of these events, these contracts generate a wealth of data that can offer profound insights into public sentiment, market trends, and predictive accuracy.
Moreover, these event contracts play a crucial role in enhancing market liquidity. The introduction of diverse trading opportunities attracts a broader range of participants, from individual retail traders to institutional investors. This diversity not only enriches the market ecosystem but also helps in distributing risk more evenly, leading to a more robust and resilient financial market.
The argument that these contracts resemble gambling fails to recognize their economic value and regulatory potential. Unlike unregulated gambling, event contracts operate within a structured framework designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability. By banning these contracts, the CFTC risks driving such activities to unregulated, offshore markets, where there is little to no oversight, ultimately harming the very consumers and markets the Commission aims to protect.
Rather than imposing outright restrictions, the focus should be on developing a comprehensive regulatory framework that ensures the safe and fair operation of these markets. This can include measures such as enhanced transparency requirements, rigorous oversight, and safeguards against market manipulation. By doing so, the CFTC can harness the innovative potential of event contracts while maintaining the integrity and stability of the financial system.
The proposed restrictions overlook the broader implications for market innovation and the future of financial technology. In an era where technological advancements are rapidly transforming financial markets, it is imperative to adopt a regulatory approach that is both forward-thinking and adaptable. Event contracts represent a step towards a more dynamic and inclusive market environment, one that embraces innovation and leverages the collective intelligence of market participants.
I strongly oppose the proposed restrictions and urge the Commission to reconsider its stance. A more balanced and informed approach to regulation will not only protect market participants but also foster an environment where innovation can thrive. I hope the CFTC will take this opportunity to engage with stakeholders, gather comprehensive feedback, and develop a regulatory framework that supports the continued growth and evolution of event contracts, and extend the comment period to allow for more time for input from concerned stakeholders like myself.

As a writer for a prominent financial publication, my role involves dissecting market regulations and their broader economic implications. The proposed restrictions on election contracts are deeply concerning. Election contracts offer unparalleled insights into market sentiment and political risk, both of which are critical for informed investment decisions. By curbing these contracts, the CFTC is effectively stifling a valuable tool that investors use to hedge against political uncertainties and navigate volatile market conditions.
Election contracts are not just speculative tools; they serve a pivotal role in enhancing market efficiency and transparency. These contracts allow investors to express their views on political outcomes in a regulated environment, contributing to a more accurate and dynamic market landscape. The predictive power of election contracts, backed by collective intelligence, provides a real-time gauge of political sentiment, which is invaluable for both investors and policymakers.
Furthermore, the CFTC's blanket restriction undermines the principle of market innovation. By restricting election contracts, the Commission is disregarding substantial evidence that these instruments contribute positively to financial markets. Effective regulation should aim to harness the benefits of innovative financial tools while ensuring their integrity and safety. A nuanced approach that includes stakeholder engagement and data-driven analysis is essential.

I am writing to express my support for the proposal to allow political betting with higher limits. Political betting markets have the potential to serve as powerful aggregators of diverse information, reflecting the collective wisdom and insights of engaged citizens. These markets can often predict election outcomes more accurately than traditional polls, offering valuable insights into public sentiment.
Allowing higher limits on political betting would not only align with the freedom of expression and the open exchange of ideas but also enhance market efficiency. It would provide a regulated and transparent platform for individuals to engage in political discourse through financial means, much like how investors speculate on commodities or stock prices.
Moreover, regulated political betting markets could contribute to a more informed electorate. By analyzing betting odds, voters can gain an understanding of the political landscape that is often less biased than the information presented by partisan media outlets. This could lead to more informed voting decisions and a more robust democratic process.
It is also important to consider the economic benefits. Higher limits could attract more participants, increasing liquidity and the accuracy of the market as a prediction tool. Additionally, it could generate significant tax revenue and create new opportunities for financial innovation.
In conclusion, allowing political betting with higher limits under the CFTC’s regulatory umbrella would not only provide economic benefits but also enhance the democratic process by offering a more accurate reflection of political probabilities.

As a retiree deeply invested in the markets that shape my financial stability and retirement savings, I am writing to express my support for Kalshi's election contracts. The benefits of introducing these contracts are clear and numerous. This comment will outline why I believe the CFTC has gone wrong:
Firstly, Kalshi’s proposed contracts will ensure all market participants are identified and subject to rigorous know-your-customer and anti-money laundering protocols. This level of transparency, including audit trails and regulatory oversight, is unmatched by alternative data sources, which often lack federal regulation and clear disclosure standards. Unlike traditional polling, which can't always verify the identities or motivations of respondents, Kalshi offers a regulated environment where predictive information is both transparent and trustworthy.
Secondly, polling data has grown increasingly unreliable due to respondents' hesitancy to share truthful information and biases introduced by modern communication methods. Kalshi’s market participants, driven by financial incentives, are more likely to provide accurate predictions. This accuracy, free from the biases that affect other predictive methodologies, enhances market reliability. The insights gained from Kalshi’s contracts can help me and others adjust our financial strategies, particularly in anticipating changes in bond markets tied to election outcomes.
Thirdly, Kalshi’s differentiated market allows knowledgeable observers to express their judgments, fostering competitiveness, accuracy, and transparency across all predictive forms. This informed participation enriches the overall marketplace, providing a clearer picture for all investors. Concerns about potential market manipulation through Kalshi are largely unfounded. Manipulators would be disincentivized by the need to identify themselves and face regulatory scrutiny. Instead, they would likely resort to less regulated avenues like social media. Moreover, the ambiguous relationship between market signals and electoral outcomes further diminishes the potential for manipulation.
Additionally, Kalshi’s contract will not monopolize the electorate’s perception of election outcomes. Voters will still have access to diverse predictive sources, allowing them to weigh Kalshi’s information against other data. The integrity of Kalshi’s market will foster public trust, ensuring the contract's predictive results remain unbiased and accurate.
Finally, the public’s reliance on Kalshi’s predictive information will depend on their confidence in the contract's integrity. This trust will drive the contract's value to society, ensuring that its sponsors maintain an unbiased and accurate marketplace.
In conclusion, Kalshi’s election contracts will provide a tool for managing financial risk and enhancing market transparency, including for retirees like myself.

Kalshi’s proposed election contracts offer a level of transparency and regulatory compliance that alternative predictive sources lack.

Polling data has become less reliable, and Kalshi’s market-driven predictions, backed by financial incentives, are a much-needed alternative.

Kalshi’s election contracts offer unparalleled transparency and regulatory compliance, a stark contrast to the murky waters of alternative predictive sources. For instance, when I was working on a piece about market volatility around election periods, the data from traditional polls and statistical models left much to be desired in terms of clarity and reliability. Kalshi's model, however, with its know-your-customer and anti-money laundering requirements, would have provided a much clearer and more credible picture.
Further, these contracts serve a critical role in price discovery across various markets. Take, for example, an energy firm trying to predict the future market value of fuel. This firm would consider numerous factors, including weather forecasts and supply chain predictions. However, political risk remains a significant variable, often difficult to quantify. Election prediction markets can fill this gap by offering data-driven insights into potential legislative changes, which directly affect production costs and market dynamics. This would enable more accurate pricing of commodity futures, benefiting not just active market participants but also those relying on these markets for critical information.
I recall a time when I interviewed several business leaders who voiced their frustrations over the lack of reliable data on political risks. Their concerns highlighted a broader issue that Kalshi's election contracts could effectively address. By offering a regulated and transparent platform for election predictions, Kalshi can provide the kind of actionable intelligence that businesses need to navigate uncertain political landscapes.
Concerns about market manipulation through Kalshi’s contracts are overblown. The stringent regulatory oversight and the transparency of these contracts make them less susceptible to such risks compared to unregulated alternatives like social media. The ambiguity in manipulating election outcomes further diminishes these concerns, making Kalshi a safer and more reliable source of predictive information.
The introduction of Kalshi's election contracts would be a significant boon for market confidence and investor decision-making. These contracts not only enhance risk management but also contribute to the overall transparency and efficiency of the market.

Millions of businesses are impacted by shifts in Congressional control, which can influence legislation, regulatory environments, and overall economic activity. Without a transparent way to hedge these risks, businesses are left vulnerable to unpredictable changes. Kalshi’s contracts provide a much-needed tool for managing these political risks effectively.

Kalshi’s election contracts could serve as an invaluable tool, allowing us to better anticipate these changes and strategically plan our programs and advocacy efforts.
The CFTC’s decision to ban these markets is not only misguided but also detrimental to organizations like mine that rely on accurate predictive data to navigate uncertain political waters. Without these contracts, we are left guessing at potential legislative shifts, which can lead to inefficient use of resources and missed opportunities.

You are wrong to propose this rule one event contracts. You have not engaged with those who would be affected and those who may benefit from the markets you have restricted exchanges like Kalshi from listing. You have also not done the work to understand these markets so I hope that you truly take the time to read the comments people have been thoughtful about.

Kalshi's election prediction markets could provide valuable foresight, helping us navigate these changes. The CFTC’s opposition to these markets disregards the practical needs of farmers. Accurate predictions about election outcomes would allow us to better manage our production cycles and financial planning. They would also allow me to directly hedge the risks associated with what happens in elections. For example, changes in dairy import-export policies have a direct impact on our milk prices.

Kalshi’s election prediction markets could provide the foresight needed to anticipate these changes. The CFTC’s decision to ban these markets is short-sighted. Accurate data on election outcomes helps us make informed decisions about crop management and market strategies. For instance, changes in regulations can affect our ability to grow and sell hemp products. Predictive insights help us navigate these uncertainties and mitigate risks. This tool is vital for ensuring the sustainability and profitability of our farming operations.
Growing hemp involves navigating a complex web of regulations that can change with each election cycle. Whether it's state-level decisions about licensing requirements, federal guidelines on CBD extraction, or international trade policies that open or close markets, staying ahead of these shifts is crucial. Kalshi’s election prediction markets could serve as an early warning system, providing us with data-driven forecasts of potential regulatory changes. This would allow us to make proactive adjustments, such as altering our crop rotation, investing in new processing equipment, or seeking alternative markets.
Moreover, trade policies significantly affect the hemp industry. Tariffs and trade agreements can influence the cost of importing necessary supplies or exporting our products. If election predictions indicate a potential shift towards more protectionist policies, we could adjust our business strategies accordingly, perhaps by stockpiling essential materials or exploring domestic markets more aggressively. Conversely, if the forecasts suggest a move towards more open trade policies, we could prepare to expand our export capabilities, taking advantage of new opportunities.
The hemp industry also faces unique challenges related to public perception and legal status. Election outcomes can influence public policy and societal attitudes towards hemp and its derivatives. For example, if predictions suggest an election outcome favoring stricter regulations on CBD products, we might diversify our product lines or invest in compliant formulations. On the other hand, if the forecast favors more liberal policies, we could ramp up production and marketing efforts to capitalize on a more favorable regulatory environment.
In addition to regulatory and trade considerations, labor policies influenced by political decisions can affect our operations. Election prediction markets could provide insights into potential changes in immigration policies, minimum wage laws, and labor rights, all of which impact the availability and cost of farm labor. With this foresight, we could plan our hiring strategies and labor management more effectively, ensuring that we have the necessary workforce to sustain our operations.
Finally, environmental regulations shaped by political outcomes play a crucial role in sustainable farming practices. Predictive insights into potential changes in water usage regulations, pesticide restrictions, and land use policies could help us adopt more sustainable and compliant farming practices. This proactive approach not only ensures regulatory compliance but also enhances the long-term sustainability of our farming operations.
In conclusion, Kalshi’s election prediction markets offer a comprehensive tool for navigating the multifaceted challenges faced by hemp farmers. By providing accurate data on potential election outcomes, these markets enable us to make informed decisions, mitigate risks, and strategically plan for the future. Denying us access to this tool leaves us vulnerable to the unpredictable nature of political changes, undermining the stability and profitability of our farming operations. We need this innovative solution to ensure the continued growth and success of the hemp industry in Colorado and beyond.",0,,,ORGANIZATION,our business;our members;we;our farming operations;the hemp industry,"The comment consistently uses collective pronouns ('we', 'our') and refers to 'the hemp industry,' indicating representation of a group rather than a single individual, despite the mention of being a 'hemp farmer'."

Being a farmer in Georgia means political decisions on subsidies, trade tariffs, and agricultural policies directly affect my livelihood. Kalshi's election prediction markets could offer essential foresight to prepare for these changes. The CFTC’s opposition to these markets overlooks their potential benefits. Accurate predictions about election outcomes are crucial for making informed decisions about crop production and market engagement.
The impact of political decisions on my farm's viability cannot be overstated. Federal subsidies often play a crucial role in our financial planning, providing a safety net during periods of low market prices or adverse weather conditions. Election outcomes can significantly alter these subsidy programs. For example, if an election forecast indicates a potential reduction in agricultural subsidies, we would need to adjust our financial strategies, perhaps by cutting back on expansion plans or delaying equipment upgrades. Conversely, if an increase in subsidies is likely, we could consider investing in more advanced farming technologies to boost productivity and profitability. We all deserve a tool to manage these risks.
Trade tariffs are another critical factor influenced by political decisions. Peanuts are a significant export product, and the imposition of tariffs can drastically affect our market access and pricing. For instance, if election predictions suggest the possibility of higher tariffs on agricultural exports, we would need to explore alternative markets or increase our focus on domestic sales. We could also adjust our production volumes to align with expected demand fluctuations, thereby avoiding oversupply and price drops. Conversely, if the predictions indicate a move towards more favorable trade agreements, we could ramp up production and prepare to capitalize on increased export opportunities.
Agricultural policies, including those related to environmental regulations, also have a direct impact on our farming practices. Election outcomes can lead to changes in pesticide usage, water management policies, and land use regulations. Accurate election predictions from Kalshi could provide us with the necessary foresight to implement proactive measures. For example, if stricter environmental regulations are anticipated, we might invest in more sustainable farming practices, such as precision agriculture technologies that reduce pesticide and water use. This not only ensures compliance with upcoming regulations but also positions our farm as an environmentally responsible operation, potentially attracting premium markets and consumer support.
Market engagement and crop production decisions are closely tied to political stability and predictability. Election outcomes can affect commodity prices, demand forecasts, and overall market conditions. With Kalshi’s election prediction markets, we can better time our planting and harvesting schedules to coincide with favorable market conditions. For example, if an election forecast suggests economic policies that could lead to higher commodity prices, we could increase our planting acreage and optimize harvest timing to maximize profits. Conversely, if unfavorable policies are predicted, we could diversify our crop portfolio to include more resilient or in-demand crops, thereby mitigating potential financial risks.
Furthermore, labor policies shaped by political decisions influence our ability to hire and retain farm workers. Changes in immigration laws, minimum wage standards, and labor rights can significantly impact labor availability and costs. Predictive insights into election outcomes could help us plan our labor strategies more effectively. If stricter immigration policies are forecasted, we might invest in automation technologies to reduce our dependence on manual labor. On the other hand, if labor-friendly policies are anticipated, we could expand our workforce to increase production capacity and efficiency.
In short: election markets should be allowed and they should be regulated! They are vital and innovative and important for risk management. Please reconsider this proposal.

Firstly, these markets encourage a more informed and engaged electorate. Students, often seen as the next generation of voters, can benefit significantly from this engagement. By participating in election outcome markets, students are incentivized to research candidates, policies, and political trends more thoroughly. This deeper understanding promotes critical thinking and helps students become more informed citizens, capable of making better decisions both in markets and at the ballot box.
Secondly, election outcome markets can serve as a practical educational tool for students studying economics, political science, and related fields. These markets provide real-world examples of how predictions, probabilities, and market dynamics function. For instance, students can observe how news events, debates, and public opinion shifts impact market prices, offering concrete lessons in market behavior and the principles of supply and demand. This hands-on experience is invaluable, providing a dynamic complement to theoretical coursework and enhancing the overall educational experience.
Moreover, the predictive power of election outcome markets can be harnessed for broader societal benefits. Markets often aggregate vast amounts of information from diverse sources, resulting in predictions that can be more accurate than traditional polling methods. By studying these markets, students can gain insights into the effectiveness of various forecasting tools and methodologies. This knowledge is not only academically enriching but also has practical applications in fields such as public policy, strategic planning, and data analysis.
Lastly, election outcome markets can foster a sense of global citizenship among students. By engaging in these markets, students are not only participating in their own democratic processes but are also able to follow and understand political developments in other countries. This international perspective can enhance their awareness of global issues, cultural differences, and the interconnected nature of modern political landscapes.

Would an effective date that is 30 days after publication of the final rule amendments in the Federal Register provide registered entities with sufficient opportunity to comply with the amendments?
No, a 30-day effective date would likely not provide registered entities with sufficient opportunity to comply with the amendments. Regulatory changes often require substantial adjustments in operational processes, systems, and compliance protocols. Registered entities need adequate time to interpret the new rules, train staff, update internal systems, and ensure that they meet all new requirements without causing disruptions to their ongoing activities. A 30-day window is typically too short to accomplish these tasks thoroughly, potentially leading to compliance issues and operational risks.
Would the proposed 60-day implementation period provide sufficient time for the expiration of, or orderly cessation of trading in, listed event contracts that are impacted by the proposed rule amendments?
No, a 60-day implementation period will not be sufficient for the expiration or orderly cessation of trading in listed event contracts impacted by the proposed rule amendments. Event contracts often have varying durations and complexities that require careful management to unwind or transition. A 60-day period may not account for the contractual obligations and market practices associated with these contracts. Ensuring an orderly cessation of trading necessitates a more extended period to avoid market disruptions, protect market participants' interests, and maintain overall market stability.
Finally, I add one more comment here. a 60-day comment period is much too short for this comment period on event contracts. This process has been rushed. There has been no engagement with stakeholders. There has been no roundtable. There has been no concerns cited by the CFTC.

73896.0,06/27/2024,89 FR 48968,William,Weir,Private citizen,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=73896,"I respectfully disagree with your proposal to disallow markets in election events.
I understand the concern about the possibility of introducing gaming into the election process, in the sense of individuals casting their votes for the purpose of financial gain rather than genuine civic interest.
However, assuming the events themselves are appropriately defined, I believe the possibility of such gaming, or even the possibility of individuals *believing* such gaming is possible and giving it a try, is extremely remote.  All that is required is to make sure that the events themselves are not defined to include such a small number of voters that a meme stock-like band of individuals could successfully sway the outcome.
For example, it is inconceivable that the election result for an entire state, based on the votes of millions of individuals, could possibly be swayed regardless of the amount of trading in the contracts for that event.  Realistically, only a small fraction of voters in any state would have a financial interest in those contracts, and even if they were all to collude in their voting, which is again highly unrealistic, the net impact could not reasonably be expected to sway the outcome of the election.
If, on the other hand, a contract were constructed based on the outcome of an individual precinct, the possibility of collusion and successful gaming of the result seems more plausible, albeit still remote.
Consequently, the potential harm of allowing the trading of contracts on election events seems minimal.  However, the potential benefits are substantial.
Most importantly, such markets would be the surest way of providing non-partisan expectations of election outcomes, which benefits individuals, businesses, and society alike.  To whatever extent we believe election polling to be useful and allowable, we should feel even more so about markets on election results, precisely because they are less able to be manipulated.
Investors in a contract on an election event have no realistic hope of their investment swaying an election, and their expected profit is maximized by investing according to their truthful expectation of the election result.  The market-determined price of the contract provides uniquely valuable insight into the collective weighing of all available information about the election, including poll results, by a multitude of investors who each have a vested interest in correctly predicting what the result of the election *will* be, not what they *hope* it will be.

For those unaware, Chevron deference is a previous Supreme Court precedence which provided deference to government agency experts to interpret ambiguities in the plain text of the law for enforcement purposes. It gave agencies such as the CFTC authority to do things like define terms in the law as trusted experts in what Congress intended. This precedent was recently overturned, removing this authority from the CFTC, rendering their internal rules and policies moot in any court of law. Courts will interpret the actual text of the law on their own merits, not supplemental agency decisions and rules about, for instance, how to define “gaming”. Following this Supreme Court decision, the CFTC’s proposed rule no longer has any force of law. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the plain text of enacted legislation should be interpreted by the courts, and is not subject to further interpretation by unelected agency officials.
As such, any attempts by CFTC personnel to implement or enforce such a rule are an obvious waste of taxpayer dollars. In addition to the effort expended by civil servants to actually continue with hearings, enact the rule, and communicate and enforce it, they open the agency up to systematic risk of lawsuits, whereby the failure of one agency “rule” to be upheld in court will be an open invitation to all previous violators of the same rule to challenge their violation and be entitled to compensatory damages or settlements. This is especially true in light of the fact that the proposed rule is already seeking to control activities which have already been tried in the courts recently, and which were decided against the CFTC.
Agency efforts would be much better spent referring any important ambiguities in actual enacted legislation to congressional staffers so that elected members of Congress can enact legislation that has the effect of law.

I am writing to express my deep concern and disappointment regarding your potential categorization of election event contracts as gaming activities that are contrary to the public interest. As a citizen deeply invested in the quality of our democratic processes and public discourse, I strongly believe that prediction markets have significant potential to enhance and elevate our political conversations and decision-making.
Prediction markets, when properly implemented and regulated, serve as powerful tools for aggregating information and forecasting outcomes. In the context of elections, they can provide valuable insights into public sentiment, candidate viability, and potential policy impacts. By allowing individuals to ""put their money where their mouth is,"" these markets often cut through partisan rhetoric and media bias, offering a more objective view of political landscapes.
But I think their most important benefit is one well outlined by Scott Alexander:
'They short-circuit discussion of “which expert should we trust?” or “how do we know which sources are biased?” All prediction markets speak with a single unified voice, that voice will always be at least as trustworthy as any individual expert, and it cannot be biased. If you’re not sure which of many competing experts (or supposed experts) to trust, you should always trust a prediction market instead of any of them. And the same is true of people on the opposite side of the political spectrum who doubt all the sources you trust and vice versa.
According to Pew Research , a poll of experts named “the breakdown of trusted information sources” as one of the leading challenges of the 21st century (who are these “experts”? was the poll fair? did Pew really say this, or am I making it up?) Millions of words have been written on how to solve this crisis, with most ideas being impossibly naive or dangerously authoritarian. I think prediction markets are a genuine solution, one that can’t come fast enough.'
https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/prediction-market-faq
I understand that the CFTC may be hesitant to approve such markets due to concerns about the regulatory burden of verifying election results and prosecuting potential election fraud. However, I believe these concerns are misplaced, that there are other agencies with the responsiblity for ensuring the security of our elections, and we should not let these concerns outweigh the substantial public benefits that prediction markets can offer. The CFTC's primary mission should be to serve the public interest, and in this case, that interest is best served by fostering tools that enhance political understanding and engagement.
I urge the CFTC to reconsider its position on election event contracts and to work towards developing a regulatory framework that allows for the responsible operation of political prediction markets. The potential benefits to our democratic process and public discourse are too significant to ignore.
I strongly believe that properly regulated election event contracts and prediction markets are not only in the public interest but could become vital tools for strengthening our democracy in an era of increasing polarization and misinformation.

Mr. Christopher Kirkpatrick
Secretary of the Commission
Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Three Lafayette Centre
1155 21st Street NW
Washington DC 20581
Dear Mr. Kirkpatrick,
Subject: Comment Letter Re Proposed Rule 89 FR 4896 Advocating for Event Futures Contracts as Bona Fide Risk Transfer Mechanisms
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is proposing amendments to further specify types of event contracts that fall within the scope of section 5c(c)(5)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and are contrary to the public interest, such that they may not be listed for trading or accepted for clearing on or through a CFTC-registered entity.   As a lawyer in the futures and derivatives space, and before this, a floor trader and broker, I am writing to advocate for the recognition and inclusion of futures events contracts as legitimate tools for risk transfer, particularly in the context of systemic risks and catastrophic events.
Modern portfolio diversification strategies, while effective against market volatility, at times fall short in addressing systemic risks that result from catastrophic events. As such, futures markets present a valuable opportunity to hedge against these risks much as interest rate contracts and financial market index contracts are already risk benchmarks vital to the global financial markets.
Argument for Bona Fide Risk Transfer
Systemic risks, by their nature, affect large portions of the market simultaneously, rendering traditional diversification strategies ineffective. Catastrophic events, including climate-related disasters, can have widespread financial impacts that transcend individual market segments. Futures contracts tailored to these risks provide entities with a mechanism to hedge against potential losses, thus enhancing financial stability.
The introduction of futures contracts focused on political events and even climate and other catastrophic risks would contribute to overall market stability by allowing for risk transfer. By providing a structured way for businesses and governments to manage risk, these contracts can mitigate the financial disruptions caused by unforeseen catastrophic events. This stability is essential for maintaining investor confidence and ensuring the smooth functioning of financial markets.
Futures markets are instrumental in generating forward-looking price signals that reflect collective market expectations. Contracts based on catastrophic events can provide valuable information on perceived risks and potential impacts, aiding in better risk assessment and planning. These signals can drive investments in mitigation and adaptation strategies, contributing to broader societal resilience against systemic risks.
The evolution of financial markets has always been driven by innovation. The development and adoption of futures contracts for systemic risks represent a natural progression in the financial sector’s ability to manage complex risks. These instruments can attract new participants, enhance liquidity, and promote a deeper understanding of risk dynamics.
The CFTC’s mandate includes promoting market integrity and protecting market participants. Enabling futures contracts for catastrophic risks aligns with these goals by providing robust risk management tools that protect against significant financial disruptions. Moreover, these contracts can support public policy initiatives aimed at enhancing economic resilience and sustainability.
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) primarily addresses unsystematic risk through diversification but does not adequately account for systemic risks. Historical events such as the 2008 financial crisis and recent climate-related disasters have highlighted the limitations of MPT in shielding portfolios from systemic shocks. Futures contracts for systemic risks offer a complementary risk management tool, enabling investors to hedge against large-scale disruptions that traditional diversification cannot mitigate.
Comparison with Election Event Contracts
On December 11, 1992, the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) introduced catastrophic insurance futures contracts, they were designed to transfer risks associated with catastrophic events, providing a valuable hedging tool for the insurance industry.  The foresight of the exchange was remarkable.  Arguably we may be seeing what happens when the insurance industry cannot adequately transfer risk and the costs are passed to the consumer public.  While there may arguably be valid public policy reasons to exclude election event contracts, it is important to recognize that they share similarities with catastrophic events in terms of the systemic risks they pose to the market. Allowing futures contracts for such events would provide a structured risk transfer mechanism, benefiting market stability and offering protection against significant financial disruptions.
The concept of bona fide risk transfer mechanisms, as established in existing futures markets, extends beyond traditional definitions of the gaming industry. The futures market has already proven effective in managing the largest types of risks that affect the global financial markets, including those arising from systemic and catastrophic events.  For example, during the crash of 1987, market participants were able to short the equity market through the use of futures.  By considering the inclusion of election contracts within this framework, the Commission can enhance the market’s ability to manage a broader range of risks. This approach aligns with the overarching goal of providing robust risk management tools to market participants.
Game Theory Argument
From a game theory perspective, the inclusion of futures contracts for catastrophic events can create a more resilient market structure. In an environment where market participants can hedge against systemic risks, the overall market becomes more robust and less susceptible to panic and systemic failures. This strategic interaction benefits all participants by distributing risk more effectively, reducing the likelihood of extreme outcomes that can destabilize the entire financial system. Moreover, by allowing hedging against large-scale risks, futures markets can encourage proactive risk management and investment in mitigation strategies, fostering a more stable economic environment.
In game theory, the concept of Nash equilibrium can be applied to understand how futures markets for catastrophic events can stabilize the financial system. Suppose each market participant i has a set of strategies Si, which include hedging through futures contracts. The utility function Ui (Si, S_i) represents the participant's payoff, where S_i denotes the strategies of all other participants. In a Nash equilibrium, each participant's strategy is optimal, given the strategies of others:
Ui(Si*,S-i*)≥Ui(Si,S-i*)∀Si∈Si*,∀i
By hedging through futures contracts, participants mitigate their exposure to catastrophic risks, leading to a stable equilibrium where no participant can improve their utility by unilaterally changing their strategy. This equilibrium reduces the overall risk in the system, contributing to market stability.
Conclusion
In conclusion, recognizing and incorporating futures contracts as bona fide risk transfer mechanisms for systemic risks and catastrophic events aligns with the fundamental purposes of futures markets.  If the regulated futures markets are able to hedge the risk of the entire economy through interest rates and the domestic capital markets through financial futures, it can serve as a hedge against election risk.
I applaud the work of the CFTC in its work of keeping the United States futures markets among if not the most transparent and liquid financial markets in the world.  The Commission would be well advised to see how election and other event contracts can play a crucial role in enhancing market stability, providing valuable risk signals, and supporting innovation in risk management.  It is up to the task.  I urge the CFTC to consider these arguments and facilitate the development of event futures contracts, thereby strengthening the financial market’s ability to manage systemic risks effectively.
Thank you for considering my comments.

These contracts have obvious and undisputed economic value, as the Federal Funds rate affects interest rates throughout the world economy and are intrinsically difficult to forecast. See here for more on how Kalshi's Federal Funds contracts beat other forms of rate forecasting: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/retail-traders-are-beating-big-firms-in-guessing-where-u-s-interest-rates-will-go-next-c05196fd.
However, I cannot stake my entirely livelihood on the outcome of individual events; if I went ""all in"" on one event, like the Federal Reserve's decision in June, it could cost me the ability to trade in the future and earn a livable income for myself if I make a mistake. As a result, my trading strategy requires me to manage risk by forecasting across a wide variety of event contracts, so that by being more right than wrong on average, I can earn an income. Some of these other events the Commission proposes to restrict. For example, a meaningful portion of my income as a trader comes from forecasting the President's approval rating, the outcome of court cases, and other events that the Commission might construe as ""involving"" a ""contest"" under the proposed rule. Success in these markets enables me to grow my liquidity, which I in turn deploy to better price markets related to the Federal Funds rate, inflation, employment, and other markets whose value the Commission does not in dispute.
This principle applies across event contracts as an emerging product class: markets involving contests cause liquidity and better prices to accrue to markets which have undisputed economic utility. Blanket restrictions of the type proposed will damage this liquidity and pricing mechanism for a host of markets that the Commission undoubtedly wants to protect and cultivate.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,"I write to the Commission; I am an independent trader and forecaster; This year I have spent a substantial effort; As a result of my efforts, and other similarly situated traders; I cannot stake my entirely livelihood; my trading strategy requires me to manage risk","The comment heavily relies on personal experience, trading strategies, and livelihood, using 'I' and'my' frequently, indicating an individual perspective despite the metadata."

Secretary of the Commission
Commodity Futures Trading Commission
Three Lafayette Centre
1155 21st Street NW
Washington DC 20581
Dear Mr. Kirkpatrick,
Thank you for taking the time to read this note. I appreciate the Commission’s recent efforts to clarify the rules related to event contracts.
I write to you as a concerned citizen and student who has spoken to dozens of people (including current and former CFTC members, professionals at Kalshi and PredictIt, academics, journalists, and political strategists) about political prediction markets.
I disagree with Proposed Rule 8907-24. This would deprive Americans of valuable information and limit innovation in the United States. I believe the Commission’s concerns about election integrity and being an “election cop” are misplaced.
I agree with George Mason University Economics Professor Robin Hanson (https://comments.cftc.gov/Handlers/PdfHandler.ashx?id=33688) that political prediction markets offer concrete social benefits. They allow traders to hedge risks associated with political outcomes and they benefit the public by providing information regarding likely election winners. Many studies demonstrate the information value these markets generate (over political commentators).
I agree with Senator Tuberville’s concerns (recently expressed to Chairman Behnam in a letter) that rules limiting event contracts listed by Designated Contract Markets (DCMs) “will drive innovative companies overseas” and “place U.S. markets at a competitive disadvantage.” For example, Polymarket has demonstrated market value and become one of the largest global prediction markets (>$200M in volume year-to-date, larger than CFTC-regulated markets such as Kalshi or PredictIt) but has focused on customers abroad since the CFTC's January 2022 settlement. This deprives the American public of the information value provided by the most comprehensive and well-developed prediction market. Banning existing US-focused prediction markets will cause further harm.
I agree with Representative Torres that election integrity concerns expressed by this Commission and other legislators are overblown (https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000184-3518-d0bb-a1ff-377b6ae70000). Malicious actors already have large incentives to influence election outcomes, whether it be financial interest (e.g. one candidate’s proposed tax bill is more favorable) or ideology. In fact, prohibiting these markets can threaten election integrity by “worsening the public’s understanding of our democratic process.”
The Honorable Chair Rostin Behnam has stated that allowing political event contracts would “put the CFTC in the role of an election cop.” I agree that the CFTC should not police elections. However, CFTC Commissioner Mersinger wrote in her dissent on the recent proposal to ban election prediction markets that the CFTC, “has enforcement authority with respect to natural gas… but that does not mean the CFTC… is tasked with the protection of the integrity of physical natural gas or power markets… the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission does all that.” Similarly, the Federal Election Commission (FEC) will continue to protect our elections, regardless of whether election prediction markets are approved or not.
Also, the CFTC is already wading into products beyond its traditional domain when it comes to blockchain. The Commission should approve political event markets, even if such markets are beyond the traditional regulatory scope of the CFTC, given they are in the public interest. Even if this involves
I recognize legitimate concerns about the downsides of these markets. However, I believe narrow regulatory guidelines for markets focused on political outcomes – with clear reporting requirements – can bring innovation back to US soil and serve the public interest. I believe these benefits outweigh the concerns.

73942.0,07/24/2024,89 FR 48968,Andre,Fluellen,Beyond The Game Network,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=73942,"As an 8-year NFL veteran, I have seen the importance of sports in the United States.  Fans and businesses have vaulted the NFL to nearly $20Bn in annual revenues with related businesses bringing in many more billions each year.  Other major sports leagues bring the total value of the industry closer to $100Bn annually.  The rise of sports betting and fantasy sports have created new revenue streams and brought fans closer to the game they love.
After I retired from the NFL, I launched Beyond The Game Network.  Our group of 30 former pro athletes invests and partners with startups building the newest sports technology offerings.  Since 2018, we have worked with 25 startups creating new companies in sports, media, gaming, and fitness.  This work has given me a unique perspective on the sports industry.  My business partner at Beyond The Game Network has traded trillions of dollars of futures, options, and derivatives during his 20-year investment banking career, so our group understands this market as well.
The Commission’s attempt to clarify the terms of §40.11 is an important step in overseeing the derivatives market. However, the proposed rules go beyond clarification and instead prohibit the use of these important instruments in the sports industry.  This not only affects teams and players, but the broader sports ecosystem that also includes vendors, merchandise vendors, the hospitality industry, and much more. The sports industry is much more than just the game on the field.  Its impact is felt throughout each city that hosts games.
A blanket prohibition on event contracts in sports would be short sighted and would stunt innovation, especially as the sports industry itself is still evolving. The sports industry is one of the most important in America and has continued to grow in revenue and importance with the American public.  This can be clearly seen in TV ratings with the NFL alone making up 93 of the 100 top watched programs last year.
Another issue with a total prohibition on sports event contracts is the negative impact this will have on other industries, including hospitality and media. Sports are deeply intertwined in the culture and economy. However, with limited hedging options, a blanket ban against sports contracts will inevitably have ripple effects on hotels, restaurants, real estate owners, and others.  These businesses could use sports events contracts to manage exposure with investments in their operations and growth.
Event contracts are useful tools in hedging economic risk for many industries, not just sports. For both retail participants and entities, there are only limited and expensive options for hedging risk based on an occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, but an event contract offers legitimate hedging opportunities for those who may not have another means to do so. For example, a restaurant near a sports stadium may want to hedge the possibility of cancellation or lower attendance that would impact their revenue for the day. Without event contracts, such businesses have no way to properly manage such risks.
While I appreciate the Commission’s efforts to add more clarity, I urge the commission to reject a ruling that has such a broad ban against a major industry. It will have detrimental impacts not just on the sports industry, but other related industries by preventing them from accessing markets to hedge appropriate business risks.

Election contracts offer a unique tool for predicting political outcomes that could significantly impact the economy and, by extension, my retirement portfolio.

Restricting these contracts would not only diminish transparency in the marketplace but also remove an essential risk management tool for retirees like myself who need to navigate the uncertainties of political developments.

These contracts are legal, regulated, and safe, offering structured and transparent means for businesses like mine to hedge against uncertainties.

The proposed ban on election contracts would strip away a vital tool that supports small businesses in making informed decisions.

These markets, particularly those related to elections, sports, and entertainment awards, provide significant insights and hedging opportunities that traditional financial instruments often cannot match.
The predictive power of election contracts, in particular, allows traders like me to gauge market sentiment and political risk with a high degree of accuracy. This level of precision is crucial for making informed trading decisions and managing portfolio risk. By offering a regulated environment for these contracts, platforms like Kalshi ensure transparency and safety, which are essential for maintaining investor confidence.
The proposed ban on these contracts by the CFTC overlooks their value and potential to enhance market transparency and efficiency. These contracts are not just speculative tools; they serve a critical function in providing market participants with actionable data that can inform investment strategies and risk management practices. For example, the insights from election contracts can help traders anticipate market reactions to political events, allowing for better preparation and response to market volatility.
Prohibiting these contracts is not a form of regulation but a step backward for financial innovation. It restricts access to valuable market information and could drive trading activity to less regulated and potentially riskier environments. This move undermines the progress made in developing safe and transparent markets for event contracts.
I strongly oppose this rulemaking and encourage the CFTC to adopt a more nuanced approach to regulation. Engaging with stakeholders to understand the real-world benefits of these contracts and considering the substantial data supporting their economic utility is essential.

While I do not use its markets for my professional work, I felt compelled to write to express my concerns about the Commission’s proposed rules, which seem to overlook the true utility and benefits of these markets.
The proposed definition of 'gaming' is overly broad and fails to distinguish between activities that have substantial economic or commercial relevance and those that are purely speculative. For example, staking something of value on the outcome of a political contest involves significant research and analysis, unlike gambling, which is based on chance.
Event contracts related to major economic indicators and policy changes should be explicitly identified as they have significant macroeconomic impacts. Contracts involving political contests should not be categorized similarly to those involving war, terrorism, or unlawful activities, as they serve different purposes and do not raise the same public interest concerns.
The hedging and price discovery utilities of these contracts are crucial for assessing their public interest.

Elections
Election markets are in the public interest. I’m not some prediction market purist who believes prediction market odds are better than polls or should be taken as gospel. However, the biggest advantage is that prediction markets give real time odds that inform the public in a way that traditional reporting cannot. Here are several examples of my experiences with prediction markets providing a public service:
1) In 2018, there was a tight Senate race in Arizona. Kyrsten Sinema trailed Martha McSally by a significant amount of votes, with only mail left to count. The narrative coming out election night was that McSally was probably favored (WaPo election guy Henry Olsen called it for her mistakenly), but Sinema would likely pick up some votes in the mail-in ballots, but there would also be a late drop-off votes that would probably be favorable to McSally. It is this exact situation where you want prediction markets to exist. There was a major senate race up for grabs, the pundits were wrong, and the experts you should have wanted the public to listen to were those who were incentivized to get the answer right. Kyrsten Sinema ended up winning comfortably and there was no batch of mail-in or drop-off ballots that were favorable to Martha McSally.
2) In 2020, on election day, the markets favored Democrats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, while they favored Republicans in Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, and Georgia. In Florida, the markets started to drift to Democrats as some Election Day partisan early voting data started to come in. These were not actual election results, but the data showed that Democrats were showing up to vote. Then, we started to get actual election results. Early voting results were dumped first. Counties started to come in showing a somewhat close race, until prediction market traders got a significant piece of data: Miami Dade County was awful for Democrats. Florida was easily going to go for Trump. CNN didn’t call the race until 4 hours later. The markets took this piece of data from Florida and began to consider Trump to be a heavy favorite. The initial votes from Michigan and Pennsylvania were election day votes that showed Trump winning. It was clear Trump was going to win in North Carolina. Texas was worse than expected for Democrats including a massive shift in the Rio Grande Valley to Republicans. Georgia was interesting in that the New York Times election needle showed Trump to be favored, but in reality, we didn’t have much data from Atlanta. Still, taking the picture of data, the odds had shifted towards Trump. Brit Hume mentioned this several times on Fox News, and the Fox News round table began to taunt Donna Brazile after she said “there was still a path to Joe Biden winning.”Later in the evening, Arizona began to release election results. The results showed Biden and Mark Kelly winning in the all important Maricopa County. Soon after, Fox News called Arizona for Joe Biden to the shock of their own broadcast and honestly the country. The general election odds immediately took a hard turn towards Joe Biden, which again, Brit Hume reluctantly shared multiple times on their own broadcast. As it turns out, this call was borderline ridiculous and the prediction market traders were right to be hesitant at first, but the important reaction for the markets was to shift the general election odds with the information that Biden had probably won Arizona. Later in the evening, at around 3:30 AM, the election results site Decision Desk HQ had somehow acquired the election day results for Milwaukee, Wisconsin before any other news outlet had them. These results showed that Biden was clearly going to win Wisconsin, and the election odds immediately surged towards him. Finally, as Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Michigan continued to count their votes over the next 24 hours, it became immediately clear that Biden would win the election, despite the media not calling it for 4 more days.
3) In 2022, the prediction markets greatly favored Republicans. Republicans were favored in Senate seats for Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada (somewhat heavily in some of these). The exit polls came out and showed some increased interest in abortion. Then we began getting election results. Florida was a bloodbath for the Republicans. The worst loss for Democrats in a very long time. However, the initial results from Georgia and North Carolina were not indicative of a red wave. The overall odds began to move towards the Democrats. Soon after, the polls closed in Pennsylvania. It became clear that Governor Josh Shapiro was going to win in a landslide. In the first 2 completed counties, John Fetterman had run ahead of Joe Biden. He was now favored in the election odds to win over Dr. Oz, despite the fact that TV networks were only in the “hmmm, we’re intrigued phase.” Election odds began to shift across the board towards the Democrats. As more and more polls began to close, it became very clear that Republicans did not have the great night they expected. The House was up for grabs, Kevin McCarthy was in trouble, the Democrats expanded their lead in the Senate, and all but 1 battleground governorship remained in the Democrats hands. Prediction markets were ahead of the news in each of these occasions.
I’m attempting to paint a picture with all of these stories on how important prediction markets are to elections. It’s not that pundits are dumb and prediction market traders are always right. It’s that the public deserves a real-time accounting for what is going to happen. Most people don’t have time to know what each margin in each county means for the outcome of their election. To be honest, most people don’t know who their congressman is. There’s nothing wrong with that, but that’s the world we live in. The best counter to that is to allow people who know what every precinct in every state means for the final election result to process information quickly, bet their own money on what that information means, and provide real time odds for the public that will be an unbiased, strong estimate, of where each race currently stands.
If you deny this opportunity, you will be denying the public a great service that can’t be replaced by pundits. At a time when both sides of the aisle are terrified of trusting the polls, the public needs these experts in these markets more than ever. Additionally, if you deny this opportunity, you should be honest with yourself that the prediction markets will not go away. They will just continue to be unregulated in which traders will use VPNs and cryptocurrency to trade on their elections and legislation in real time. There will be consequences to this. One consequence will be that the pundits of the world may be less likely to quote the prediction market odds because either he doesn’t know these unregulated markets exist or they don't feel comfortable sharing that information. Another, more important consequence is that the government will likely take in fewer tax dollars due to the difficulty of tracking unregulated crypto market profits. That’s a very negative result for the CFTC.
Finally, the risks here are minimal. Unless the Supreme Court is planning on overturning Citizens United soon (which isn’t happening), you will not get rid of money in politics. Both parties are aggressively spending a record amount of money. You could put reasonable restrictions on the types of election contracts offered to limit any risks (ie, some monetary limits and/or not allowing named candidates to be listed to eliminate negative incentives). There is no world in which an election market with, to throw out a number, $5000 limits is a risk to election integrity. Respectfully, you are being extremely naive to pretend that’s the case. In fact, the opposite is true. People spending their own money to predict an outcome is a hedge in favor of election integrity. Market participants are strongly incentivized to price these contracts at fair value. If there was a market priced where one candidate was priced at 90% and the other was priced 10%, and the 90% candidate won but the 10% candidate claimed fraud, the market pricing would be a point in favor of a fair election. These markets are a good thing for election integrity.
If you ban election contracts, you’re just putting customers more at risk. People will still find ways to bet on this anyway and their funds will be less secure. You will restrict market innovation and public knowledge for absolutely no reason.
Awards and Contests
The CFTC is attempting to classify awards and contests as gaming. As basis for this, they are using a colloquy between Senator Feinstein and Senator Lincoln that talked about gaming during the discussion of Dodd-Frank as evidence that it was Congressional intent to ban these contracts. First of all, You can’t find video of this colloquy anywhere on C-Span; it was very likely inserted in the Congressional record afterwards. It didn’t actually happen. Despite that, in the colloquy, the Senators do not mention awards and contests at all. The mention horse racing and sports. If Congress wanted awards and contests classified as gaming, they would have clarified that in the law. They did not. This is an overreach from the CFTC that goes well beyond their jurisdiction.
There are multibillion dollar industries that would have hedging interests in these markets. They should be given the opportunity to hedge their risk. In addition, the great thing about these awards and contests is that the results are almost certainly certified by one of the major accounting firms, which protects these contracts from manipulation. Furthermore, the CFTC has already allowed Kalshi to list contracts surrounding the Oscars, Emmys, Grammys, Country Music Awards, SAGs, BAFTAs, CrunchyRoll Anime Awards, and the Nobel Prize. Several of these contracts have been listed for multiple years. At any time, the CFTC DMO could have referred the contracts to the commission for review and/or a comment period like they did with the Control of Congress contracts. They did not do that. They allowed Kalshi to list these contracts and allowed participants to trade on them and gave both parties the assumption that the CFTC allowed trading on this category of markets. There are open markets on Kalshi right now, which were approved by the CFTC, in which participants have their funds invested in the outcomes of these contracts. Declaring these markets against the rules would cause chaos. While it would be great to believe that the CFTC has some great plan on how to deal with customer funds in this scenario, as we saw when they tried to shut down PredictIt, they almost certainly do not. It is in the public’s interest to expect consistency out of their government. By changing the rules to exclude contracts that the CFTC previously allowed AND IS CURRENTLY allowing, the commission would be violating the public’s trust.
Concluding Remarks
In the open meeting, DMO chair Vince McGonagle voiced various concerns about how when you trade a commodity, you’re trading a thing. With event contracts, there is no thing and thus you have to rely on various underlying sources that the CFTC does not have the resources to regulate. I just would like to say to Mr. McGonagle that I’m sorry he does not like that his job has turned into dealing with markets that ask interesting questions that affect millions of people in the country. Some people are just meant to love following the price of cocoa and nickel and I understand that. I’m sorry to the staff at the CFTC that feels so overworked by Kalshi wanting to offer interesting contracts that they have decided that they need to ban things in order to reduce their workload. I’ll choose to ignore that the CFTC tried to desperately increase their authority regulating crypto and met with Sam Bankman-Fried approximately 50 times. I guess that increase in workload would have been ok, but the workload forced upon them by the events contracts was just too much.
However, with all due respect, that is not my problem. That is not Kalshi’s problem. That is certainly not a PUBLIC INTEREST problem. That is ABSOLUTELY NOT a reason to make new restrictive regulations that help absolutely no one and hurt many people, including me. That is YOUR problem. Figure it out, hire different people, find a different job, or retire.
The CFTC granted PredictIt a No-Action Letter. They hilariously botched attempting to ban PredictIt and have produced minimal evidence of PredictIt violating their no-action letter. Any evidence they did produce was laughed out of court and rebutted by Victoria University in copious detail.
The CFTC approved Kalshi as a DCM. They allowed Kalshi to list markets across various categories including climate, politics, epidemiology, music, and movies. They clearly have worked with the Kalshi markets team on various occasions and have negotiated with them not to list certain contracts. Kalshi has worked in good faith with the CFTC and the way the CFTC pays them back is by trying to ban several products that their customers enjoy very much, which the CFTC had previously approved.
Instead of working to setup a responsible regulatory system to enforce the integrity of elections contracts, the CFTC is instead trying to hand wave them away, despite interest from the public NEVER BEING HIGHER. At this very moment, I believe I’ve read 2 negative comments in this entire comment packet. One of them is from Elizabeth Warren, which was almost certainly solicited by the CFTC. For the CFTC commissioner or staff member reading this, put a mental pin right here. As of August 5th, the comments are approximately multiple hundreds to 2 in favor. You’re violating the public trust of people who actually care about this if you move forward, even if you get Ralph Nader’s useless organization to provide thousands of hysterical comments about Democracy at the last second again.

Covering major sporting events as a sports journalist, I have a profound understanding of the critical role that prediction markets play in analyzing team performance, player statistics, and fan engagement. These markets can provide nuanced insights that enhance the depth and accuracy of sports coverage. Kalshi’s proposed sports prediction markets could revolutionize how sports analysts, journalists, and enthusiasts predict game outcomes and individual player performances, leading to more informed and engaging content.
For instance, imagine a scenario where a prediction market is set up for an upcoming football season. Analysts could use data from these markets to gauge public sentiment and probabilities regarding a team's chances of winning the championship or a player’s likelihood of securing the MVP award. This real-time data would allow journalists to create more dynamic and interactive content, offering readers and viewers a more engaging experience as they track their predictions alongside actual game results. Additionally, these markets could help identify emerging trends and under-the-radar players who might be poised for a breakout season, providing a more comprehensive and exciting narrative for fans.
The CFTC’s proposal to restrict these markets raises significant concerns about stifling innovation in sports analytics. These markets are not just tools for betting; they are valuable resources for generating data that can improve the quality of sports journalism and fan interaction. By limiting these markets, we risk curbing the development of advanced analytical tools that can provide deeper insights into the complexities of sports.
Allowing more time for public commentary on this issue would enable sports journalists, analysts, and enthusiasts to advocate for the inclusion of these markets. It would also highlight their potential to enhance sports coverage and foster a more interactive relationship between the media and the audience. For example, sports networks could integrate prediction market data into their broadcasts, offering live updates on market sentiment during games, which could add an exciting new dimension to the viewing experience.
Furthermore, these markets could drive fan engagement by allowing enthusiasts to participate in predictions, creating a more interactive and immersive experience. Fans could see how their predictions stack up against market trends and expert analyses, fostering a deeper connection to the sport. This interaction could be especially beneficial during major events like the World Cup or the Super Bowl, where the global audience is vast and diverse.
In conclusion, Kalshi’s sports prediction markets offer significant potential to enrich sports journalism and fan engagement. By enabling analysts to provide more accurate and engaging content, and by fostering a more interactive relationship between fans and their favorite sports, these markets can play a pivotal role in the future of sports media. The CFTC should consider the broad benefits these markets offer and provide sufficient time for a thorough discussion on their potential impact.

I have consistently relied on platforms like Kalshi to enhance the accuracy and depth of my predictions. The proposed ban by the CFTC on election prediction markets strikes at the core of democratic transparency and informed decision-making. These markets not only provide a nuanced understanding of voter sentiments but also serve as critical tools for journalists, policymakers, and the public to gauge the potential outcomes of elections. In my career, I've seen firsthand how these markets contribute to a more informed electorate and facilitate robust discussions on policy implications. Banning them would not only restrict innovation in predictive analytics but also deprive stakeholders of valuable insights into the electoral process.

74015.0,08/05/2024,89 FR 48968,Michael,Santos,,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=74015,"Leading an economic research institute, I've found Kalshi's election prediction markets to be indispensable tools for modeling various economic scenarios and forecasting market reactions to potential policy changes. These markets provide a wealth of real-time data that is crucial for anticipating how different electoral outcomes might influence economic policy and market dynamics. For instance, during the last election cycle, we used prediction market data to model the potential impact of various tax policy proposals on business investment and consumer spending. This allowed us to prepare comprehensive reports for our clients, offering insights into how changes in administration could affect their strategic planning and financial decisions.
Kalshi’s markets offer a transparent and efficient mechanism for capturing the collective wisdom of diverse market participants, which can be invaluable in predicting regulatory shifts and their subsequent impact on economic stability. For example, if there is speculation about a candidate proposing significant regulatory reforms in the energy sector, the prediction market data can help us forecast potential market reactions, such as changes in stock prices for energy companies or shifts in commodity prices. This predictive capability enables businesses to hedge against potential risks and seize emerging opportunities.
The CFTC's proposal to ban these markets overlooks their critical role in providing reliable data for economic forecasting and risk management. These markets are not merely speculative tools; they are vital for constructing accurate economic models that inform policy decisions and business strategies. For instance, during periods of political uncertainty, businesses rely heavily on predictive data to make informed investment decisions. By anticipating shifts in the regulatory environment, companies can adjust their investment portfolios, manage risks more effectively, and maintain market stability.
As an economist, I believe that restricting access to such predictive tools would significantly undermine our ability to provide accurate economic analyses. It would also hinder our capacity to advise policymakers on prudent fiscal policies. For example, during debates on healthcare reform, prediction market data could help us assess the economic impact of various policy proposals, providing policymakers with evidence-based insights to guide their decisions. Without this data, our analyses would be less precise, potentially leading to less informed policy decisions that could have far-reaching negative consequences for the economy.
Moreover, these markets play a crucial role in enhancing the transparency and accountability of economic forecasting. By providing a real-time snapshot of market expectations, they enable economists to refine their models and improve the accuracy of their predictions. This, in turn, helps build trust among stakeholders, including businesses, investors, and policymakers, who rely on our analyses to make critical decisions.",0,,,ORGANIZATION,Leading an economic research institute; we used prediction market data; prepare comprehensive reports for our clients; collective wisdom of diverse market participants; our analyses,"The comment consistently references an economic research institute, client reports, and collective analyses, indicating an organizational perspective despite the initial mention of 'I'."

These markets serve as an invaluable educational tool, enabling students to see firsthand how abstract legal theories manifest in the dynamic environment of political predictions and market behaviors. The CFTC's proposal to ban these markets raises substantial concerns regarding academic freedom, intellectual inquiry, and the educational benefits of innovative financial instruments.
Kalshi’s markets provide a practical framework for students and scholars to delve into intricate legal concepts such as regulatory oversight, market regulation, and constitutional rights. For instance, during discussions on the separation of powers and checks and balances, students can analyze how prediction markets reflect public expectations of legislative and executive actions. This engagement fosters a deeper understanding of the democratic process and the implications of regulatory decisions on financial markets and individual rights.
Furthermore, these markets offer a unique pedagogical approach, allowing educators to integrate economic, political, and legal perspectives into their curriculum. By examining how market predictions respond to political events, students gain insights into the broader societal impacts of legal rulings and legislative changes. This interdisciplinary exploration enhances their critical thinking and analytical skills, preparing them for diverse careers in law, public policy, and academia.

These markets promise to enrich legal education by providing practical applications of regulatory oversight and market dynamics. For instance, students could analyze market predictions of Supreme Court decisions to understand legal precedents and judicial reasoning. By studying the fluctuations in prediction markets ahead of landmark rulings, students can gain insights into public sentiment and the potential impact of judicial decisions on various stakeholders.
Moreover, prediction markets could serve as a valuable tool for moot court competitions, where students simulate real-life legal battles. For example, participants could use market data to anticipate opposing arguments and develop more robust case strategies. This practical experience would enhance their analytical skills and deepen their understanding of the complexities involved in legal decision-making.
In addition, prediction markets could be integrated into coursework on corporate governance and securities regulation. Students could evaluate the predictive accuracy of market contracts related to major corporate mergers or regulatory changes, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications. For instance, analyzing market reactions to proposed regulations could help students understand the interplay between legal frameworks and market behavior.
Furthermore, prediction markets could offer a unique perspective on international law by tracking global events and their potential legal implications. Students could study market predictions related to international treaties, trade agreements, and geopolitical conflicts, gaining a broader understanding of how legal principles are applied in different jurisdictions. For example, examining market responses to Brexit negotiations could provide valuable lessons on international trade law and diplomatic relations.

These markets illuminate potential correlations between sports triumphs and fluctuations in property values, guiding strategic investments in residential and commercial developments.
For instance, forecasting the success of Miami’s professional sports franchises, such as the Miami Heat or the Miami Dolphins, could significantly influence real estate decisions. If prediction markets indicate a high probability of the Miami Heat winning an NBA championship, developers might prioritize investments in properties near the American Airlines Arena. The anticipated increase in fan engagement and tourism could drive up demand for retail spaces, luxury apartments, and entertainment venues, making these areas prime targets for development.
Similarly, if markets predict a successful season for the Miami Dolphins, developers could consider enhancing residential projects around Hard Rock Stadium. The influx of fans and associated economic activities, such as increased spending on hospitality and entertainment, would likely boost property values and attract additional investments in the area. This strategic foresight allows developers to capitalize on the positive economic ripple effects generated by sports victories.
Kalshi's prediction markets could also aid in evaluating the impact of proposed stadium developments or major sporting events like the Super Bowl or the Miami Open. Accurate predictions about the success and economic draw of these events can inform decisions on mixed-use developments and retail expansions. For example, if the markets forecast substantial economic benefits from Miami hosting the Super Bowl, developers might expedite projects that cater to the influx of visitors, such as hotels, restaurants, and entertainment complexes, thus maximizing their returns on investment.
Moreover, these prediction markets provide valuable insights into the timing of investments. For instance, if forecasts predict a downturn in a sports team's performance, developers might delay projects or shift their focus to more stable areas, thus mitigating risks. Conversely, during periods of anticipated sports successes, developers could fast-track construction projects to align with peak consumer interest and spending, ensuring that new properties are ready to meet the heightened demand.
In the context of Miami’s vibrant and competitive real estate market, leveraging prediction markets to anticipate sports outcomes offers a unique advantage. It allows developers to make informed decisions based on potential future scenarios rather than solely on historical data. This forward-thinking approach can enhance profitability and ensure that developments are well-positioned to benefit from the economic boosts associated with sports-related activities.
For example, if the markets indicate a likely increase in the popularity of soccer in Miami, driven by Inter Miami CF’s projected success, developers could prioritize projects near DRV PNK Stadium. Anticipating increased fan engagement and international interest, developments could include soccer-themed entertainment districts, sports bars, and fan zones, attracting both local and international visitors and stimulating economic growth in the surrounding areas.
Ultimately, the integration of Kalshi's prediction markets into real estate development strategies enables a more dynamic and responsive approach to market trends. By aligning investment decisions with predicted sports outcomes, developers can optimize their portfolios, enhance property values, and contribute to the overall economic vitality of Miami’s growing urban landscape. This innovative tool not only improves profitability but also ensures that developments meet the evolving needs and interests of the community, fostering a more vibrant and economically resilient city.

I would personally use these markets for their insights into the potential impacts of legal precedents and judicial appointments on future court rulings. My recent study on Supreme Court nomination predictions could have been far more convincing and using Kalshi's market data highlighted correlations between market sentiment and confirmation outcomes, underscoring the predictive value of these markets in legal analysis.

I am writing to express my support for Kalshi's event prediction contracts, particularly those related to congressional control. As a financial analyst based in Richmond, Virginia, I understand the crucial role these contracts play in hedging against political uncertainties that directly impact market dynamics. The availability of these contracts could provide market participants with a reliable tool to manage risk associated with potential shifts in congressional power. For instance, businesses in sectors sensitive to regulatory changes could use these contracts to offset financial exposures stemming from differing legislative agendas. This ability to hedge not only stabilizes business operations but also contributes to overall market efficiency by ensuring more informed investment decisions.
Furthermore, the assertion that these contracts constitute ""gaming"" under CFTC Rule 40.11 overlooks their substantive role in risk management for entities not traditionally involved in gambling activities. Instead, these contracts offer legitimate hedging opportunities, akin to other widely accepted financial instruments used across regulated markets.

This rule is misguided and counterproductive for several reasons:
Regulated markets provide valuable information
Election markets on regulated exchanges can serve as powerful predictive tools, aggregating diverse information and providing valuable insights into public sentiment and likely electoral outcomes. This data can be utilized by researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand political trends and voter preferences.
Consumer protection and market integrity
Banning these contracts on regulated exchanges will not eliminate demand, but rather push activity to unregulated offshore markets or illegal betting operations. Regulated exchanges offer essential consumer protections, transparency, and market integrity that are absent in underground markets.
Risk management tool
Event contracts related to elections can serve as legitimate risk management tools for businesses and investors to hedge against policy and geopolitical risks. Prohibiting these instruments removes a potentially valuable financial tool from the marketplace.
Innovation and competitiveness
The proposed rule stifles financial innovation and puts U.S. markets at a competitive disadvantage globally. Other jurisdictions allow election-related derivatives, and the U.S. should not fall behind in developing these markets.
Overreach of authority
The CFTC's mandate is to regulate derivatives markets, not to act as an ""election cop"" or arbiter of the democratic process. This rule exceeds the Commission's expertise and Congressional mandate.
Mischaracterization as ""gaming""
Classifying election-related contracts as ""gaming"" mischaracterizes their nature and potential utility. These contracts can serve legitimate economic purposes beyond mere speculation.

Participants in election markets are not merely engaging in financial transactions; they are expressing their opinions and beliefs about political outcomes through their investments. This form of expression is analogous to other protected forms of speech, such as writing an editorial or participating in a public debate.
By prohibiting election markets on regulated platforms, the CFTC is effectively stifling a unique and valuable form of public discourse. This action infringes upon First Amendment rights, which protect not only spoken and written words but also other forms of expressive conduct. Financial markets have long been recognized as a venue for expressing opinions about economic and political events. To single out election markets for prohibition sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to further encroachments on financial and expressive freedoms.
Moreover, this proposed rule goes against the spirit of open markets, which thrive on the free flow of information and the ability of participants to act on their insights and beliefs. Open markets are designed to aggregate diverse opinions and information, leading to more accurate pricing and better decision-making. By banning election markets, the CFTC is undermining this fundamental market mechanism and depriving the public of valuable predictive information.

These markets provide a unique and powerful mechanism for aggregating diverse information and opinions in real-time, offering insights that traditional polling methods simply cannot match.
Unlike conventional polls, which provide static snapshots of public opinion at specific points in time, election markets offer continuous, dynamic feedback. This real-time data allows campaign teams to respond swiftly to changing sentiments, emerging issues, and unexpected events. The efficiency and accuracy of these markets stem from their ability to incentivize participants to act on their best information, creating a self-correcting system that often outperforms expert predictions.
Moreover, election markets capture nuanced information that polls might miss. They reflect not just what people say they believe, but what they're willing to stake money on – often a more reliable indicator of true convictions. This can help campaigns identify hidden strengths or weaknesses in their strategies, allowing for more targeted and effective resource allocation.
Banning these markets would remove a critical tool for running efficient, responsive, and data-driven campaigns. Without access to this real-time feedback mechanism, campaign strategists would be forced to rely more heavily on less accurate and less timely information sources. This could lead to less efficient campaign spending, potentially increasing the influence of big donors and special interest groups who can fund extensive private polling.
Furthermore, the loss of election markets would have broader implications for our democratic process. These markets serve as a form of public engagement, encouraging citizens to stay informed about political developments and think critically about electoral outcomes. They provide a valuable educational function, helping the public understand concepts like probability and uncertainty in political forecasting.
The CFTC should carefully consider these broader implications for our democratic process. By banning election markets, the Commission would not only be limiting a valuable campaign tool but also restricting a form of political engagement and education. In an era where fostering informed civic participation is more crucial than ever, we should be expanding, not contracting, the avenues through which citizens can engage with the political process.

I am writing to express my concern regarding the proposed ban on election-related event contracts and to advocate for the importance of prediction markets in our democratic process.
Prediction markets serve a vital role in aggregating information and providing valuable insights into public sentiment and likely electoral outcomes. These markets offer several key benefits:
Enhanced forecasting: Prediction markets have often proven more accurate than traditional polling methods in forecasting election results.
Risk management: They allow businesses and investors to hedge against political and policy risks that may impact their operations or portfolios.
Increased transparency: The data generated by these markets can be a valuable tool for economists, journalists, and policymakers to gauge voter sentiment.
Public engagement: Prediction markets can increase civic engagement by providing citizens with a tangible way to express their views on electoral outcomes.
While I understand the concerns about potential manipulation or the appearance of ""gambling"" on elections, I believe these risks can be mitigated through proper regulation and oversight. Banning these markets outright would deprive us of a valuable source of information and a legitimate financial tool.
Furthermore, pushing these markets offshore or underground may actually increase the risks of manipulation and fraud, as they would operate without the safeguards and transparency provided by CFTC oversight.

I am writing to express my deep concern regarding the proposed rule and potential ban on election prediction markets. I believe this rule will have several unintended and detrimental consequences that must be carefully considered.
Banning election prediction markets will likely push these activities offshore or underground. When markets operate outside the purview of U.S. regulatory bodies, the risks of manipulation and fraud increase significantly. Without the oversight and transparency that the CFTC provides, these markets could become breeding grounds for unethical behavior, undermining the very integrity of the electoral process that the ban aims to protect.
The CFTC has a critical role in ensuring the integrity and transparency of financial markets. By maintaining election prediction markets under your purview, you can implement appropriate safeguards to mitigate risks and ensure fair play. This approach would not only protect participants but also preserve the valuable insights these markets provide.
Instead of an outright ban, I urge the CFTC to focus on shutting down illegal players and enhancing regulatory frameworks. By doing so, you can address concerns about market manipulation and fraud while still allowing the benefits of prediction markets to be realized. These benefits include more accurate forecasting of election outcomes, increased public engagement, and valuable data for researchers and policymakers.
In conclusion, I implore the CFTC to reconsider the proposed ban on election prediction markets. By maintaining these markets under your regulatory oversight and implementing robust safeguards, you can mitigate risks and ensure that the benefits they provide are not lost. This balanced approach will protect the integrity of the electoral process while fostering an environment of transparency and trust.

Event contract markets serve a crucial dual purpose:
Risk Hedging: These markets allow participants to efficiently hedge against risks associated with one-off or non-standard events. This includes elections, global crises (such as wars, terrorist attacks, or pandemics), and other potentially catastrophic outcomes. The ability to hedge against such risks is invaluable for businesses, organizations, and individuals alike.
Information Aggregation: Perhaps even more importantly, these markets produce a well-honed price signal that informs the general public about significant events of public and national interest. This externality is a substantial public good, providing real-time, market-based assessments of probabilities related to critical events.
The Commission's proposal seeks to eliminate these benefits based on what appears to be a distorted perspective, clouded by remote possibilities and unsubstantiated claims about potential adverse consequences. The resulting draconian measures would disallow entire categories of event contracts that have substantial public and national benefits.
It is particularly concerning that the Commission's proposal ignores widely publicized and well-known data and case studies that clearly demonstrate the public and national interest benefits of event contracts. Instead, the proposal offers no concrete data or evidence to substantiate its concerns. This approach is not only unscientific but potentially harmful to the public interest.
The available data, which I urge the Commission to review thoroughly, shows that many of the event contracts the Commission aims to classify as contrary to the public interest are, in fact, critical to the public and national interest. These markets have consistently provided valuable insights and risk management tools that benefit a wide range of stakeholders.
I implore the Commission to reconsider its position and to base its decisions on empirical evidence rather than speculative concerns. The potential loss of these valuable market mechanisms would be a significant setback for public information and risk management capabilities.
Furthermore, I urge the Commission to engage in a more comprehensive dialogue with market participants, academics, and other stakeholders to fully understand the implications of its proposed actions. A more nuanced and evidence-based approach is necessary to ensure that any regulatory changes truly serve the public interest.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,"I am writing to express my strong opposition; The ability to hedge...is invaluable for businesses, organizations, and individuals alike; I urge the Commission to review thoroughly; I implore the Commission to reconsider","The comment consistently uses personal language ('I','my', 'urge') and presents a personal stance, indicating an individual's perspective despite mentioning businesses and organizations."

I would like to express my strong opposition to this proposal, as it undermines the significant value that election markets provide for both hedging and data forecasting.
Value of Election Markets for Hedging
Election markets serve as crucial tools for risk management, allowing investors to hedge against the uncertainties associated with political outcomes. In an increasingly volatile political landscape, businesses and investors face a range of risks tied to elections, including changes in policy, regulatory shifts, and economic impacts. By enabling participants to place bets on the outcomes of elections, these markets provide a mechanism for effectively managing exposure to these risks. The ability to hedge against potential adverse political developments is essential for maintaining portfolio stability and ensuring that businesses can navigate uncertainties without incurring significant losses.
Forecasting and Data Insights
Beyond their hedging capabilities, election markets also generate valuable data that can enhance forecasting accuracy. The prices in these markets reflect the collective wisdom and sentiments of a diverse group of participants, including political analysts, economists, and the general public. This real-time feedback loop offers insights into voter behavior, policy implications, and market reactions, making election markets a powerful tool for predicting outcomes. Historical data from these markets has demonstrated a strong correlation with actual election results, providing investors with a reliable basis for decision-making.
Impact of the CFTC's Proposed Rule
The CFTC's proposed rule threatens to limit the functionality and accessibility of these important markets. By imposing restrictions on event contracts specifically designed for political outcomes, the rule would stifle innovation and reduce the liquidity that is essential for effective price discovery. This could lead to a less informed market environment, where participants have limited access to the critical data generated by election markets.
Moreover, the proposed rule fails to recognize the broader economic implications of restricting election markets. In a democratic society, the ability to express opinions and make predictions about political events is fundamental to informed decision-making. By curtailing these markets, the CFTC risks undermining the very principles of transparency and accountability that are vital for a healthy democratic process.
Conclusion
In conclusion, election markets play a vital role in both hedging against political risks and providing valuable forecasting data. The CFTC's proposed rule, by limiting the scope and functionality of these markets, would not only hinder risk management strategies but also diminish the quality of information available to investors.

This speaks volumes about the platform's inefficacy in blocking American traders, who easily bypass restrictions by using VPNs.
This alarming growth rate raises serious questions about regulatory oversight and consumer protection on Polymarket. It is disconcerting to see that despite a 2022 settlement with the CFTC requiring Polymarket to exclude U.S. users, the platform continues to see a significant influx of American traders. This is a clear indication that the measures in place are insufficient and that the CFTC's enforcement mechanisms are not robust enough.
In stark contrast, Kalshi operates under stringent U.S. regulations, fully registered with the CFTC, ensuring that all trading activities are fair, transparent, and secure. Kalshi's recent partnership with the Susquehanna International Group further underscores its commitment to providing a legally compliant and user-friendly trading environment.
This data underscores the urgent need for the CFTC to take decisive action against platforms like Polymarket that operate in legal gray areas and endanger user investments. The agency's focus should shift towards supporting compliant entities like Kalshi, which adhere to regulatory guidelines and offer a secure trading experience.
While Polymarket's growth might seem impressive, it is built on shaky and possibly illegal foundations. The CFTC needs to enforce its regulations rigorously and shut down platforms that fail to comply with legal standards, ensuring that operators like Kalshi, who play by the rules and protect their users, are the ones that thrive.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,This speaks volumes about the platform's inefficacy; It is disconcerting to see; This data underscores the urgent need; While Polymarket's growth might seem impressive,"The comment presents an opinionated analysis and calls for action without referencing a formal organization or using collective pronouns, suggesting a personal perspective."

As an environmental policy advisor, I've seen the stark reality of how a political twist can unfurl into new laws, regulations, and environmental mandates. It’s a scenario reminiscent of a Suzanne Collins novel, where every action, every alliance, has consequences that shape the narrative of our future. Election contracts, such as those devised by Kalshi, are akin to the strategic moves in an elaborate game, predicting and preparing for the outcomes of political change.
Such contracts are a beacon in the murky waters of market expectations regarding political tides, as they bring a layer of transparency and foresight much needed in strategy formulation and policy recommendations. Consider this: a farmer hedging against the prospect of an environmental regulation that might affect crop yields, using election contracts to secure stability regardless of which way the political winds blow. This is the embodiment of tactical preparedness.
Regrettably, the proposed restrictions on election contracts are akin to obscuring the stars that have long guided navigators through uncertain seas. These proposed rules seem to miss the mark on recognizing their role in risk management and the discovery of fair prices. They’re not whims of fancy; they're the structured chords that tie the symphony of regulated markets together. Curtailing their use only encourages a retreat into shadows and speculation, intensifying risk and clouding the data that could otherwise illuminate our path forward.

74216.0,08/07/2024,89 FR 48968,Robert,Harris,,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=74216,"I am a concerned citizen who has actively and profitably traded political event contracts on PredictIt since the 2020 US elections. I write to speak in favor of allowing legal and well-regulated political event contracts in onshore US designated contract markets, as well as to support the ongoing existence of PredictIt unless and until it is either displaced by or itself evolves into a designated contract market.
First, on the substance of whether betting on political events constitutes “gaming”, I feel strongly, as do my tax returns in the past few years, that success in trading political event contracts is a skilled endeavor far more comparable to trading other financial markets than “gaming”. This distinction – whether a betting outcome is primarily determined by skill or chance, is the most common distinction used when judging which novel activities constitute “gaming” across our various state and federal laws, and important because many other ways to draw that line beg the question of whether nearly all market trading is simply “gaming” that we subject to a double-standard simply because we culturally associate some wagering activities as occurring in gambling halls and others as occurring in trading pits.
We can put aside the philosophical question on the larger nature of what constitutes “gaming”, however, by considering political event contracts are pertinently unlike wagering on sporting events conventionally treated as gaming, because political events have significant implications on our lives beyond transient entertainment. As the saying goes, “elections have consequences”. Their outcomes matter beyond the events themselves and have implications relevant to business, policymaking, and how our citizens plan for their personal futures. It is straightforward to imagine them useful as a tool for hedging risk analogous to commodity futures exactly because political events deeply affect our lives and occupations.
Frankly, the notion that political events have less direct impact on the economic landscape and thereby less demand for hedging against economic risks than events currently accepted as tradable such as the weather, strikes me as intuitively false, contrary to everything I’ve been taught of the benefits to living in a free society where the people choose their leaders, and just an incredibly pessimistic and nihilistic view of how much our political choices as citizens at the ballot box actually matter to policy outcomes in America.
Second, I’d like to speak up for the value of what currently exists in America today primarily in the form of PredictIt and to highlight that we are not choosing whether to have political event contracts in the world, but whether we have them housed onshore within the purview of US regulators. Allowing them onshore means we get the opportunity to steer the benefits of market data on our politics to be usefully available for the public good and it allows us to regulate straightforward barriers to guard against perverse incentives.
PredictIt, particularly in its form as of the 2020 election cycle before the attempted withdrawal of the no-action decision under which it currently operates, has proven both that political event contracts can be traded in a manner which, through limits to size of these contracts, generate market data which informs the public as to the actual state of our elections in near real-time while also containing risks from perverse incentives. The particular limits on PredictIt, while arbitrary and deserving of review, have in some ways increased its value as a natural experiment. Restriction often breeds creativity, and I point to one such side-effect: the low contract limitations on PredictIt led it to meet growing demand by creating many parallel markets on substantively very similar but not identical political events, which produced granular public datasets about US politics that otherwise could not have existed.
I feel that the recent actions that have driven Polymarket offshore provide a cautionary tale as to what will happen if we do not allow political event contracts within a well-regulated, US-based framework. In the 2024 election cycle, most of the liquidity to trade these events now exists outside of direct US jurisdiction. Any fear we may have about the adverse impacts of political event markets is likely to be realized if we stand by and allow these markets to grow to their viable economic scale offshore where we cannot effectively and in a timely manner expect to hold them to any standards.
Finally, one last point I would like to close on, which I don’t expect many other commenters would have the perspective to say: nothing in my life has made me better informed as a US citizen about the practical mechanics of our political system, including relatively granular aspects of how we conduct our elections, count our votes, determine viable nominees for cabinet positions, and develop consensus on legislation in our legislative branch than the active research I have had to do to participate and succeed at trading political event contracts.

This proposal represents a significant overreach of the CFTC's regulatory authority and fails to recognize the numerous benefits that these markets provide for hedging and price discovery. I urge the Commission to reconsider this proposal and engage more deeply with industry stakeholders to understand the full implications of such a ban.
Overstepping Regulatory Authority
The CFTC's primary mandate is to regulate the derivatives markets to ensure they are fair, transparent, and free from manipulation. However, by proposing to ban election contracts, the CFTC is stepping far beyond its Congressional mandate. Election contracts serve a legitimate economic purpose by allowing individuals and businesses to hedge against political risks that can have significant financial implications. The CFTC's role should be to regulate these markets to ensure they operate fairly, not to ban them outright.
Commissioner Summer Mersinger has rightly pointed out that this proposal exceeds the CFTC's authority. The agency's attempt to classify election contracts as ""gaming"" is an arbitrary expansion of its regulatory scope. This move not only undermines the CFTC's credibility but also sets a dangerous precedent for overregulation in other areas of the financial markets.
Benefits of Election Markets
Hedging Political Risk
Election outcomes have profound economic consequences. Businesses and investors often face significant uncertainty around elections, which can affect everything from tax policy to regulatory environments. Election contracts provide a valuable tool for hedging against these risks. For example, a company heavily invested in renewable energy may want to hedge against the risk of a political shift that favors fossil fuels. By banning these contracts, the CFTC would be removing an important risk management tool from the market.
Price Discovery and Information Aggregation
Election markets also play a crucial role in price discovery and information aggregation. These markets have consistently provided more accurate forecasts than traditional polling methods. The prices of election contracts reflect the collective wisdom of market participants, offering a real-time gauge of public sentiment. This data is invaluable not only to investors but also to policymakers, journalists, and researchers who rely on accurate information to make informed decisions.
The Need for Engagement with Stakeholders
The CFTC's proposal has sparked significant backlash from industry participants, including prediction markets like Kalshi and PredictIt. These platforms have highlighted the benefits of election markets and have called for a more collaborative approach to regulation. Instead of imposing a blanket ban, the CFTC should engage with these stakeholders to develop a regulatory framework that addresses any legitimate concerns while preserving the benefits of these markets.
John Aristotle Phillips, co-founder and CEO of PredictIt, has described the proposal as ""ill-conceived"" and a ""mistake."" He has urged the Commission to embrace innovation and formulate a reasonable regulatory framework that keeps Americans in regulated U.S. markets rather than pushing this valuable activity offshore. This sentiment is echoed by many in the industry who believe that a collaborative approach would be far more effective in addressing the CFTC's concerns.
In conclusion, the CFTC's proposed ban on election contracts is an unnecessary and harmful overreach that fails to recognize the significant benefits these markets provide. Election contracts serve important economic functions by allowing for hedging against political risks and providing valuable price discovery and information aggregation. I strongly urge the Commission to vote against this proposal and instead engage with industry stakeholders to develop a balanced regulatory framework that preserves these benefits while addressing any legitimate concerns.

As a long-time PredictIt user, I find the proposed classification of the prediction market as ""gaming"" to be problematic and misguided.
Prediction markets are a useful tool to gauge market estimates of risk and likelihood of inherently stochastic future events, and provide a valuable tool for both market participants and people who require broad and robust estimates of probabilities associated with various future possible events.
I strongly urge that this proposal be changed.
To repeat some points from predictit themselves:
PredictIt is approaching its 10 year anniversary, making it one of the biggest and longest running prediction markets in American history.
PredictIt trades are capped at $850 per user per contract. This helps to keep the market small-scale and ensures that wealthy individuals cannot manipulate markets. This protects the sanctity of the crowdsourcing process, and differentiates PredictIt from other financial markets that are dominated by hedge funds and institutional investors.
In its 10 year history, PredictIt has made these crowdsourced probabilistic forecasts available to the public, and makes anonymized trade data available to researchers who study patterns in the data.
Research shows that these forecasts are generally accurate and are generally more accurate than polling, especially earlier in a race. This is because polls are a snapshot in time, but prediction markets allow users to weigh the effect of factors (the criminal conviction of a presidential candidate, for example) that have not yet fully resonated with voters.
Because of its accuracy, PredictIt data is widely cited by media, campaigns, and financial institutions, and even appears on the Bloomberg Terminal.
The research also shows that PredictIt makes users more likely to seek out factual information about current events. Users who build trading strategies around factual events tend to do better than those who trade based on their ideologies or misinformation. In an era where both liberal and conservative commentators are alarmed at the public’s acceptance of fake news and misinformation, these markets are one of the few mechanisms left for incentivizing the accumulation of true and accurate information (an antidote to fake news).
Despite the inherent public good that these markets offer, the CFTC is currently on the warpath against prediction markets. The CFTC is both aiming to shut down PredictIt (and has repeatedly been stopped by courts, including the second highest court in the land) and is proposing a rule that would ban election markets in the United States, perhaps permanently.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,As a long-time PredictIt user; I strongly urge; Because of its accuracy,"The comment uses personal experience (""As a long-time PredictIt user"") and expresses a personal opinion (""I strongly urge"") without representing an organization."

For people who don’t know, PredictIt works by drawing in thousands of individuals who buy shares of a contract (such as “Will Donald Trump win the 2024 US presidential election?”) at a price between $0.00 and $1. Each contract will resolve for either $0 or $1. The number of cents per contract (the current price) reflects the probability that the contract will resolve as Yes. In effect, this is a crowdsourced probabilistic forecast.
PredictIt trades are capped at $850 per user per contract. This helps to keep the market small-scale and ensures that wealthy individuals cannot manipulate markets. This protects the sanctity of the crowdsourcing process, and differentiates PredictIt from other financial markets that are dominated by hedge funds and institutional investors.
In its 10 year history, PredictIt has made these crowdsourced probabilistic forecasts available to the public, and makes anonymized trade data available to researchers who study patterns in the data.
Research shows that these forecasts are generally accurate and are generally more accurate than polling, especially earlier in a race. This is because polls are a snapshot in time, but prediction markets allow users to weigh the effect of factors (the criminal conviction of a presidential candidate, for example) that have not yet fully resonated with voters.
Because of its accuracy, PredictIt data is widely cited by media, campaigns, and financial institutions, and even appears on the Bloomberg Terminal.
The research also shows that PredictIt makes users more likely to seek out factual information about current events. Users who build trading strategies around factual events tend to do better than those who trade based on their ideologies or misinformation. In an era where both liberal and conservative commentators are alarmed at the public’s acceptance of fake news and misinformation, these markets are one of the few mechanisms left for incentivizing the accumulation of true and accurate information (an antidote to fake news).
Despite the inherent public good that these markets offer, the CFTC is currently on the warpath against prediction markets.

It has been a hobby that I spend disposable money on and make sure it's not something that ever impacts my life if I lose. I'm responsible and know that it's not investing, it's throw away money and if I win then I'll consider myself lucky and move on. I've never won any money long term with any form of gambling even though I would consider myself a pretty knowledgeable poker player and stock trader. The goal with most kinds of gambling is to find something with a positive expected value and risk what you're willing to lose but if the calculation is correct then you should win long term. Obviously my calculations have not often been correct but it's a fun exercise for those of us who enjoy it.
I don't know if I would consider prediction markets to be considered gambling or not. I'm sure for some people it is and for others it isn't. I do know there's an element of expected value to it because that's what I use to guide my decisions on where to place my money. I've been using Predictit.org for years and can confidently say this is the ONLY market that I've ever hard positive returns on my money and it's consistent.
Although I know prediction markets like Predictit are undergoing regulator scrutiny and are in danger of being outlawed in the United States entirely, I wouldn't consider myself to be informed on issue. I'm a layman on the subject. What I do know is that if it gets outlawed then I plan on continuing to participate in prediction markets through other venues that are available online with cryptocurrency. This is already what many other people are doing. Outlawing prediction markets is going to be about as practical as outlawing marijuana and Prohibition. People will find their own ways to operate and participate in the market. Wouldn't it be smarter to keep it legal, regulate it, and tax it accordingly?
I'm a progressive democrat and I definitely believe in government regulation. Regulations tend to exist for good reasons. I believe the prediction market is a market that should be legal AND regulated. There are many ways to minimize its negative impacts on society. Predictit has a great policy already built into their system that caps how much money a person can invest in a single market or contract. This is a great tool that can ensure most people won't over commit their capital to any single contract that may not work out in their favor. I'm sure there's other policies that exist on other market sites as well. Keeping this kind of market legal will help regulators and companies alike innovate in policies that can help keep the prediction market as safe as possible for its participants. I think this is a much more practical outcome rather than outlawing it which will result in the markets and participants operate outside of the the radar of regulators where sites will be less likely to regulate themselves and participants will be less protected from unscrupulous actors.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,I have engaged in all kinds of gambling; It has been a hobby that I spend disposable money on; I'm responsible; Obviously my calculations have not often been correct; I'm a layman on the subject; I'm a progressive democrat,"The comment is filled with personal anecdotes, uses first-person pronouns extensively, and expresses a personal opinion, indicating an individual perspective."

First, while ""gaming"" has a number of meanings, in this context it means playing a game of chance.  Prediction markets are NOT games of chance.  For users (like me), they provide a fun way of getting me to evaluate important political issues as objectively as possible. Political markets are not games of chance - they are opportunities to think through how groups of people evaluate candidates and issues as relevant environments change.  That is as different from a roulette wheel (an actual game of chance) as a Porsche 911 is from a VW Beetle (even if both were substantially invented by Dr. Porsche). The activity is, simply put, not ""gaming"" and so it should not be treated as if it were.  We should not incorrectly define things when we are charged with regulating them.
Second, adopting an erroneous definition resulting in termination of the ability to participate in election futures markets as enabled by PredictIt would have negative effects.  I use Predict-It's election futures prediction markets as a fun way to think deeper about elections than simply identifying outcomes or candidates I prefer.  It makes me take other people's concerns into account, something we should all do more of, not less.  Especially in a time when people are concerned with the effects of ""fake news,"" these election prediction markets provide needed education into helping us all become better at digging past political social media manipulation into a more thoughtful and honest evaluation of facts.
Third, adopting an erroneous definition resulting in termination of the ability to participate in election futures markets as enabled by PredictIt would have no positive effects.  PredictIt has embedded low trade caps to eliminate domination by the wealthy and the trade values are so low that their value lies not in making money by gambling (i.e., ""gaming"") but in digging deeper into current political issues.
Fourth, adopting an erroneous definition resulting in termination of the ability to participate in election futures markets would also have the negative effect of depriving us of the ability to permit researchers access to anonymized trade data to better understand human decision-making, and particularly political decision-making, to the benefit of all of us.

Additionally, banning electoral event contracts would strip the political science community of an essential benchmark used to predict outcomes. Betting markets are often more accurate than other forms of public data and many pundits will academically refer to them.

Explanation and Role
Election Futures platforms are primarily intended for market research and academic purposes. Participants are given the opportunity to engage in the buying and selling of shares, all based on their predictions of various political events. The main objective is to gather information from a wide range of participants in order to enhance the accuracy of election outcome predictions.
Let's talk about gambling. It's all about putting your money on the line, hoping to come out on top and maybe even make some extra cash. It's a form of entertainment that's all about the thrill of winning.
Regulation
Election Futures platforms like PredictIt adhere to specific regulatory frameworks. As an illustration, PredictIt is able to operate under a ""no-action"" letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This letter grants PredictIt the ability to run its markets for research purposes, avoiding any classification as illegal gambling.
Gambling is subject to strict legal regulations and is heavily regulated. In many places, there are specific contexts where it is legal to operate, often requiring a license.
Market Dynamics
Election Futures' share prices are subject to constant fluctuations, driven by the collective judgment and information of the participants. This generates a forecast driven by market forces, offering valuable insights into public sentiment and the probability of various outcomes.
The odds in gambling are determined by bookmakers or casinos and remain constant regardless of the actions of participants. The emphasis is placed on the unpredictable results rather than the gathering of information.
Risk and Reward
Election Futures are typically constrained and intended to mirror the likelihood of outcomes rather than being based solely on chance. The goal is to promote informed trading through knowledge and analysis.
The potential for both risk and reward is typically higher in gambling and determined by chance. Winnings are typically significantly larger in comparison to the stakes, which is a result of the increased risk and unpredictability involved.
Potential
Election Futures markets are frequently utilized by researchers and analysts to examine the process of information aggregation and make predictions about outcomes. The data collected possesses substantial educational and predictive value.
The main objective of gambling is to provide entertainment and generate profits. Typically, the outcomes of gambling do not offer any valuable insights beyond the specific game or bet at hand.
To summarize, election futures and gambling may seem similar as they both involve placing money on event outcomes. However, election futures are designed to gather information and offer predictive insights within research frameworks, while gambling is primarily focused on entertainment and profit, with distinct regulations and risk factors.",0,,,ORGANIZATION,"Election Futures platforms are primarily intended for market research and academic purposes; PredictIt is able to operate under a ""no-action"" letter; Election Futures markets are frequently utilized by researchers and analysts","The comment consistently uses formal language, focuses on platforms and regulations, and references researchers and analysts, indicating an organizational perspective rather than a personal one."

Honestly, I couldn't tell you what the Senate or House did before I joined PredictIt (PI). I'm sure I learned in school but it has nothing to do with my every day life so I just never thought about it, or avoided thinking about it.
After I joined PI, I started learning ridiculous amounts of random information when researching a market's subject. I learned all of the Senators names and what they did for their states. Heck, I even started watching those super boring votes in the Senate. I learned so much that I could finally hold my own in conversations about politics. I'd ask my friends, family, and coworkers what they thought about the subjects of a PI market and get their opinions. I wouldn't place a bet off their opinions, because well, that would really be gambling. But the point is, I did start to take more of an interest in politics.
I've also made some great contacts in the comments section of PI. Those who I trust to be honest have shown me much patience with my learning curve and I'm very glad to call them pen pals in an age where that's become obsolete.
When the CFTC stopped letting PI create new markets, I eventually cashed out. Want to know what I've done since I've left? I found myself back to not caring, ignoring all the alerts on my phone that I had set for news updates, avoiding mentions about anything politics.
I've always loved the idea that PI was created as an experiment to see if people cared more about politics if money was involved. Because it's been proven true, many times over, by me.

When I first met him, he was headstrong and stubborn, stuck in his right-wing media universe and as sure of his punditry as he was zealous about it. He gradually became more interested in the views of those outside his information silo. He realized that he could make a good living by opening his mind, listening to different points of view, and incorporating new facts into his worldview. He was a climate change skeptic. He was skeptical of moderate policies that improve lives (like the ACA).
By the time President Trump took office, he was a changed man. I saw him say things I never thought I'd see him say. He would ask intelligent questions about policy, politics, elections, and even climate change. He still leans right but even admitted that he voted for Biden, probably the first time he voted for a Democrat.
I bring this up not because I think a D-leaning CFTC might like to hear that, but because I think it's proof that people on both sides of the aisle could use a healthy dose of reality about things like climate. For that to happen, people need a healthy dose of the reality of the politics (cooperation, compromise, bipartisanship) that could do something about climate change. Left-leaning friends have told me they have become more likely to listen to conservative ideas to reach common goals because political prediction markets paid them to drop their shields and listen. They had to shed their biases. They had to shake off the terrible punditry that dominates our airwaves at no cost to those who spew it. They had to scrape off their instinct to belittle and mock information based on who said it and instead judge it based on its merits.
To put it simply: I have never seen any school teach people the way prediction markets teach them. I've learned more in the 20 years I've been investing in prediction markets than I ever learned in school (I have a BA in Philosophy).
Below are the words of my old acquaintance. For the sake of this country, I hope you will listen closely to him and stop this unfortunate action you seem intent on taking, even as we are awash in ubiquitous sports betting (thanks to lobbyists wooing lawmakers with expensive cigars and liquor*) that does no good and much harm:
---------- [begin quote]
At this point, a very large portion of the world is totally silo-ed in their news, and can't see the forest for the trees. Especially in the United States where it's basically a two team sport, people get terrible information that biases them in godawful ways. They essentially wear a blindfold of partisanship. And we traditionally associate this with Republicans, but as an example -- we just saw quite a lot of Democrats being totally blinded to the fact that Biden had to drop out. They rejected that Biden had issues, rejected that the debate was a huge problem, rejected polling, rejected that he was likely to get blown out by Trump. Prediction markets are in many ways a partial cure to information silos on both sides of the aisle. People can be shown reality.
Overall, I would say that the point of a prediction market isn't to be an oracle that tells you the future. It can and will be wrong, sometimes hilariously wrong. The goal is to be BETTER than the alternative. A better flashlight to look ahead at the murky future.
And always bear in mind that in the absence of prediction markets, you are left purely with punditry that is unmoored from any incentive to be correct. And actually, punditry is getting worse, and the world is awash in bad punditry. Because the world needs ""content"" and opinion/punditry provides a lot of it. And there are actually high incentives to provide entertaining and not great predictions, especially in information silos, because people love hearing what they WANT to hear and not necessarily what is true or they need to hear. Prediction markets cut through the biased punditry BS that is flooding the world.

74322.0,08/07/2024,89 FR 48968,Rob,Williams,none,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=74322,"I'd like to make the case that the restriction and classification of PredictIt and its ilk as ""gaming"" is reductive, and restrictions based on it are unintentionally damaging to the public interest.
The definition of ""gaming"" used currently simply says a prediction market for political outcomes IS ""gaming"", and a stock market for business outcomes IS NOT ""gaming"".  No explanation is given as to the essential qualities that allow one to earn the classification while the other gets excluded.
Both allow individuals to predict the success or failure of a venture at a given point, and exchange representations of those predictions when they differ.  Both involve the potential of financial gain from a correct prediction, in order to incentivize actual investigation and better align the overall outcome with the reality of the situation that is being predicted.  There are minor differences (IPO's, dividends, etc), but none of these support a strong case that a stock market is not ""gaming"" while a prediction market is.  We are left with the circular definition that ""The CFTC classification of gaming is the things that the CFTC classifies as gaming"", rather than something workable and consistent.
Given this arbitrary classification, undeserving and publicly valuable enterprises are potentially getting shut down.  This attempt to protect the public interest ironically damages the public interest.  I can use PredictIt as an example.
PredictIt's goal is to gather data that can be used in research, which is more accurately reflective of individual behavior in various situations than the alternatives, such as polls.  Having participants have a stake in the proceedings aligns their actions more with their behavior in other real-life situations, vs. alternatives such as polls.  Polls are done from memory and often contain inaccuracies due to the lack of stakes involved in answering, whereas prediction markets provide both the real-time decision data and the stakes to make it realistic.  Researchers who want to better understand the impact of decision making from news consumption, the impact of hard data vs speculation, and many other things get access to this data which they can't get otherwise.  PredictIt keeps only enough money to fund the technology for gathering data.
As for the participants, the many restrictions on the site make it unappealing for gamblers only seeking to gamble, vs. the alternatives.  Positions are limited to $850.  There are no 'dark patterns' seeking to re-engage participants to participate more.  The markets take weeks, months, and years to play out -- which, combined with the low investment cap, make it both unappealing as a meaningful wealth generator AND unappealing as a quick dopamine rush that gambling addicts chase.  Anyone looking for either of these things have far better options -- and the people that remain enjoy using the site for what it is, and for how it's helping.  No one is being taken advantage of, and no one is being 'saved' by restricting this interaction.
Overall, I hope you reconsider this decision -- it is made with good intentions, but will have negative consequences regardless.

I disagree with the proposed rulemaking concerning event contracts in certain commodities.
Over the course of the last 8 years, I have involved myself briefly with the online marketplaces that allow me to take a predicted outcome and give it a monetary representation. It is not my opinion at all that these marketplaces are gaming. Nor are they similar to the predatory sports gaming markets.
It is my firm belief that the market for predictive investments in general, and PredictIt in particular, have been a net benefit to the world.
The differences between the markets of gaming and futures are different in one critical way; luck. A soybean future is about as unknown as a Presidential election, or a congressional majority. The future is not determined entirely by luck, however. It's determined by soil quality, agricultural conditions, and quantifiable metrics. Just as a congressional election is not determined primarily by luck, but by popularity. A metric which can indeed be quantified and changed.
If there are to be some more controls on the market to prevent predatory expansion, that'd be one thing. But to shut down websites entirely, or to restrict them to the same strict regulation of the sports betting companies, would be a farcical over reach of federal regulatory mandate. Status quo should be maintained during further discussion of a far lighter touch.

Also, the amount of of shares that any one person can buy in any one market is capped at a very moderate dollar amount, further distinguishing PredictIt from gaming, further preventing it from being a for-profit enterprise like gaming is, and protecting the individual from getting carried away by the very excitement and “this time is my lucky time” beliefs that characterize gambling.

I strongly oppose the proposed rule classifying election futures markets like PredictIt as ""gaming."" This mischaracterization overlooks their significant value and public benefit.
PredictIt, operating for nearly a decade, has established itself as a prominent prediction market. Its crowdsourced probabilistic forecasting model has proven valuable for researchers, media, and the public. Key points to consider:
1. Accuracy: These markets often outperform traditional polling in forecasting accuracy, especially early in election cycles.
2. Promoting factual information: Participation encourages users to seek out and utilize accurate information, countering misinformation trends.
3. Research value: Anonymized trade data contributes to academic understanding of political forecasting.
4. Responsible limits: The $850 cap per user per contract prevents market manipulation.
5. Educational impact: These markets increase engagement with and understanding of political processes.
Classifying these platforms as ""gaming"" ignores the informed decision-making and analysis that participants invest. Unlike typical gambling, success here is based on knowledge of complex political and social factors.
I urge the CFTC to reconsider this proposal and recognize the unique value of election futures markets. Banning them would be a significant loss for public discourse and our understanding of political dynamics.

I have experience in these markets, having participated in several forums over multiple election cycles. I also have experience as a personal investor in other security instruments: stocks, ETFs, iindex funds, options, fixed income.
I also have 12 yrs experience designing and administering computer systems for equities and their derivatives for a large investment firm (not my current work). And in that work, I experienced how those securities were traded - not ""gamed.""
Gaming and securities trading both involve risk. But in my experience, predictive markets for elections do not resemble gaming, but the markets for other, more commonly accepted securities.
Predictive markets track how the market participants gauge risk and reward for knowable, real-world events. A futures contract on a commodity does this for the price of a tangible commodity, which is influenced widely-known factors (supply and demand, the weather in crop-producing regions, actions of governments, etc), even if different actors with different information may evaluate the risks and rewards differently. They are also influenced by generally unknown, or less appreciated factors (a global pandemic, a war affecting commodity production and shipments, etc).
Election futures are much more similar to commodity futures. There are widely known factors (past results of candidates and parties, current polling, issues, efforts to enlist or turnout voters, etc.) And unappreciated factors (a candidate unexpectedly withdraws, an economic or geopolitical event changes opinions about their vote, etc).
Election futures may be used for speculation, just like other futures and financial instruments. But they function more like investments than bets, and have predictive value. Unlike gaming, studies show that predictive markets are pretty good predictors of election results, just as futures and options markets are pretty good predictors of future prices.

For people who don’t know, PredictIt works by drawing in thousands of individuals who buy shares of a contract (such as “Will Donald Trump win the 2024 US presidential election?”) at a price between $0.00 and $1. Each contract will resolve for either $0 or $1. The number of cents per contract (the current price) reflects the probability that the contract will resolve as Yes. In effect, this is a crowdsourced probabilistic forecast.
PredictIt trades are capped at $850 per user per contract. This helps to keep the market small-scale and ensures that wealthy individuals cannot manipulate markets. This protects the sanctity of the crowdsourcing process, and differentiates PredictIt from other financial markets that are dominated by hedge funds and institutional investors.
In its 10 year history, PredictIt has made these crowdsourced probabilistic forecasts available to the public, and makes anonymized trade data available to researchers who study patterns in the data.
Research shows that these forecasts are generally accurate and are generally more accurate than polling, especially earlier in a race. This is because polls are a snapshot in time, but prediction markets allow users to weigh the effect of factors (the criminal conviction of a presidential candidate, for example) that have not yet fully resonated with voters.
Because of its accuracy, PredictIt data is widely cited by media, campaigns, and financial institutions, and even appears on the Bloomberg Terminal.
The research also shows that PredictIt makes users more likely to seek out factual information about current events. Users who build trading strategies around factual events tend to do better than those who trade based on their ideologies or misinformation. In an era where both liberal and conservative commentators are alarmed at the public’s acceptance of fake news and misinformation, these markets are one of the few mechanisms left for incentivizing the accumulation of true and accurate information (an antidote to fake news).
Despite the inherent public good that these markets offer, the CFTC is currently on the warpath against prediction markets. The CFTC is both aiming to shut down PredictIt (and has repeatedly been stopped by courts, including the second highest court in the land) and is proposing a rule that would ban election markets in the United States, perhaps permanently.

The classification of monetary stakes in political outcomes as mere gambling is shortsighted and a disservice to the people. Importantly, the outcomes of prediction markets are not arbitrary or created for betting, like sports or slot machines. Instead, these events have a real impact in the world. Allowing people to objectively show their convictions in important events wouldn't erode the public's trust in the electoral process, but allow for strengthened accountability in both sentiments and promises. It would encourage those with a gut feeling to seek more information, and allow those in power to be held accountable for their beliefs in an unprecedented way.
For instance, if a politician were to own a number of shares in the outcome of them passing policy if they were to be elected, they would be financially incentivized to actually pass that policy if the people did elect them. In this way, prediction markets can act as a measure of truth.
In the letter, it is written:
""Political bets change the motivations behind each vote, replacing political convictions with financial calculations.""
What this sentiment misses is that political conviction development is already fueled by financial calculations. Attention-hungry media outlets with little incentive to report the unbiased truth are financially incentivized to write exclusively what their users will click. Social media algorithms calculate precisely how to send their users down rabbit holes that do not consider the truth in any capacity.
This is the current financial calculation being made in political conviction pipeline today. Prediction markets are a way for those who are lost in this pipeline to see some semblance of a common reality.
As I said, blunt regulation would be shortsighted, and would ignore not just the reality of politics today, but deny U.S citizens the potential for something better. This is not comparable to sports betting or gambling. It can increase political accountability and reduce misinformation in a field where these things matter the most, yet are currently painfully absent.

Prediction markets for elections are, in effect, another form of crowdsourced political polling. While I respect that the CFTC is worried about the impact of election betting on undermining election results, in current election prediction markets there is not enough money at stake for people to be incentivized to undermine an election. If the CFTC would like to permanently cap the amount people could bet, much as the amount that people can donate to elections is capped, this would support their main objective while still allowing for the benefits of elections markets. Research suggests that election forecasts can predict election results better than polls alone can.
Election betting is not new to the US; it was present prior to 2012. None of the CFTC's concerns are new; they were present back then as well, under a state and elections that were much more lightly regulated, and yet research from economic historians Paul Rhode and Koleman Strumpf suggests that political processes were not corrupted by any election betting.

Further, even without that point, it is my opinion that the information is relevant, and therefore the Commission has to either accept the relevance or explain in a manner that is neither arbitrary nor capricious why it is not relevant. And as I’ve made very clear, saying that the information is not relevant because it was not submitted in response to this particular round of questions is false, and facially arbitrary and capricious because I am submitting it to you in response to these questions on the gourds that I have determined that it is relevant.",1,https://comments.cftc.gov/Handlers/PdfHandler.ashx?id=35484,74406ChristopherGreenwood.pdf,UNCLEAR,As a member of the futures and swaps industry;This comment is on behalf of Temper;We would suggest kindly that the Commission allow the contract to move forward,"The comment blends personal opinions and self-identification ('As a member...', 'I adopt that comment as my own') with statements representing a company ('This comment is on behalf of Temper', 'For thousands of companies, including our own')."

As a scholar at Columbia University, I must speak to the value of Predictit as an important and necessary political public sphere. Predictit creates a unique public sphere for concerned citizens to come together to discuss and interact on political issues. This public realm is the core of democracy.
Jürgen Habermas, the eminent social theorist and philosopher, maintained that the public sphere, a place for citizens to come together to communicate and interact, is the “locus of democracy.”
Predictit's Comments Forum, which consists of over one million comments and exchanges, allows for this amazing political public sphere to occur online. Citizens discuss, argue and assess political matters of general concern.  While making $10 on a correct prediction is always rewarding, I would maintain that the real attraction of the site is the Comments Forum.  Skills of critical reasoning are applied to this political public sphere where democratic affairs are the objects of discussion.
I can think of no other political public sphere where citizens from different political perspectives are given the opportunity to engage in rational and critical discussions about candidates and important political issues. It is quite an amazing site!
In the truest sense, Predictit's ability to generate communicative interaction legitimizes our democracy.  Predictit is democracy in action!
Most sincerely,
Patricia Phillips",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,"As a scholar at Columbia University; I must speak; I would maintain; I can think of no other; Most sincerely, Patricia Phillips","The comment uses personal language ('I','my', 'I would maintain') and expresses a personal opinion, despite the metadata indicating affiliation with Columbia University, suggesting an individual perspective."

One option is of course to follow publicly-available polling data and try to guess who will win myself. This is time-consuming, and I'm not very good at interpreting the polling data.
A second option is to trust journalists or data scientists to interpret the polling data for me. Sometimes this works; 538 forecasts seemed reasonably reliable for a few years. However, it seems clear that 538 has experienced some sort of audience capture such that it is no longer focused on delivering accurate forecasts. More generally hard to tell which forecasters are honest, especially when that changes over time. In fact, the only reason I know I shouldn't trust 538 is because of how far its predictions have diverged from event contract prices.
Betting markets are much easier to interpret than raw polling data and much more resistant to ideological influences than forecasters.

74481.0,08/08/2024,89 FR 48968,Bradley,Kirksey,,https://comments.cftc.gov/PublicComments/ViewComment.aspx?id=74481,"I would like to protest the shutting down of PredictIt for the following reason
1- PredictIt has inspired, for me, the way that I invest money and donate to candidates. For example, when Roy Moore, a disgraced federal judge (removed from the bench twice) was accused of trying to hit on 16 year olds, I didn’t think it mattered because Alabama would never ever elect a Democrat to the senate. When the betting market, which generally is far more measured than a reporter saying things for clicks, said it was possible for Doug Jones to beat Moore, I donated money to a Democrat for the first time in my life. The predictive model helped inform who I donated to.
In 2020, I based my decision on who to vote for in the Democratic primaries, because PredictIt told me that Joe Biden’s implied odds of beating Donald Trump were higher than Bernie Sanders’s. The predictive model helped me see who I wanted to vote for.
Alternatively, election years create lots of uncertainty and generally you see restaurant spending and other luxury spending go down in election years. I refer to PredictIt to determine how comfortable I feel in my long term security, how I invest my actual money (green vs. coal depending on candidates) and even how I feel about going out to eat twice this week.
2- The allegation that this is luck-based gaming and not skill and knowledge derived, and non-predictive is silly when you consider that VUW, the parent university, isn’t profiting, and only bringing in enough to offset cost. What is, then, this research institution’s game, if not for research, if they aren’t profiting? Sure, the people operating PredictIt are drawing salaries, but VUW sees some reason to continue to stay involved. What is it? Surely, it has to be seeing the value of the academic research. If I can make practical decisions based on PredictIt, surely the professional researchers at VUW can as well.
3- I would also argue that this isn’t a luck-based game, but rather a game of skill and knowledge. Commonwealth v. Dent found that poker wasn’t illegal, because Poker was a game of knowledge and skill. (Yes, I know it was overturned, but only because the appellate court found that luck was integral to poker, NOT because it wouldn’t be illegal if it were a game of skill).
PredictIt has run some markets before that, for every intention, looked like gambling. How many times will Donald Trump tweet this week? Will he use the word “Emails” in the State of the Union address? Even if these somehow had academic merit, they’re still luck-based (though, my understanding was that that was part of the reason for the $850 limit). I can’t pretend that those markets had any real skill component to them.
But the majority of PredictIt would fall into the realm of a Dominant Factor Test
– Participants must have a distinct possibility of exercising skill and must have sufficient data upon which to calculate an informed judgment.
– Participants must have the opportunity to exercise the skill, and the general class of participants must possess the skill.
– Skill or the competitors efforts must sufficiently govern the results
– The standard of skill must be known to the participants, and this standard must govern the results.
– Markets like “Who will win the Democratic Primary” have zillions of potential factors. The value of endorsements, the value of momentum and the order of states, understand the immediate and long term effects of debates and fundraising. Everyone has a model, whether understood or on a spreadsheet, of how it works and why.
But the candidates that win aren’t randomly chosen. You didn’t just get an ace on the river. Joe Sestak was never going to become president. Those factors that are in place matter. And the better your model, the more likely you are to win. Understanding polling models is pivotal. Someone who has a deep understanding of the history of ActiVote vs. RCP vs. 538 vs. Marist College will do better than someone who saw one poll they liked and got cocky.
There’s lots and lots of skill involved, and an almost unlimited amount of data. Barring something shocking like a sudden death, the biggest reason that it might look like luck is because there’s so much information that it’s overwhelming and impossible to comprehend it all. Good historians never say “and then suddenly…” Understanding, culturally, what is happening and what will happen as a result is a skill.
– Of course, participants have the opportunity to use that skill, to predict trends and outcomes. This seems like the least contentious point.
– Yes. This isn’t 100%, of course, things happen. But people who understand statistics, voting patterns, weather patterns, the behavior of swing states, and the effects of actions on fundraising will do substantially better than people who don’t understand that stuff. People who read Q Anon and bet accordingly will do worse than people who regularly bet against Q Anon theories. Sometimes surprises happen, but a good understanding of politics and narrative and media will mean you win more than you lose. It’s pretty easy. Elections aren’t just the random scattering of dice.
– Participants on PI know that there is lots of knowledge out there about elections, politicians, and polling. It’s almost impossible to not know that. I’m not sure to what degree members of PI understand which indicators are more important than others (polling vs. media narrative vs. Q’s predictions) but they absolutely understand that this knowledge dictates the outcome. No sane person on PredictIt can look at the current situation and think that Mitt Romney will win the 2024 presidential election. Why? Because it’s not chance. Whatever of those metrics you use, however you acquire knowledge, whatever model you use, knowledge and skill and insight will tell you that it can’t happen.
5- I believe, absolutely, that PredictIt serves a societal good and has helped inform me. Both through how I understand politics and how I vote/donate/engage with politics. If the site is closed in February of 2025, I’ll be sad but I’ll remember it fondly.
Shutting it down between now and inauguration Day has some extra potential damages. PredictIt does this thing called “negative risk.” It’s actually pretty nifty when you’re not worried about the website’s future.
But imagine you walk up to one of the contestants at the podium on a Jeopardy! game and bet them a dollar that they’ll lose. They take it. You may or may not win a dollar. Then you go to the second contestant and bet a dollar they’ll lose. Now, if one of them wins, you’re looking at even. Now, imagine you walk up to the third person and make the same deal. Suddenly, you’re guaranteed to lose, but… you’re still guaranteed a dollar. Since you’ll win two and lose one.
PredictIt’s system is smart enough to realize that you did it and give you the dollar right there. Certain people on PredictIt really like betting no on everything, with the hope of reaching a risk-free stage like that. I personally had negative-66-dollars put into the Republican vice-presidential market.
There’s only two “fair” ways to liquidate if ordered to on the spot.
One is to cash out at the current market value. But suppose I predicted Kamala Harris will win the presidency at 58 cents. And then she drops to 50. And then it’s ordered to cash out. And she wins. I’m personally standing to lose money on something I’m right about because the website was told to pull the rug out from under my feet. That’s obviously, on the face of it, unfair.
The other alternative is to refund everyone. But remember the risk-free position that led me to having -$66 into a market? If told to liquidate at the time… PredictIt would be in a position where they’d have to tell me to give $66 back. And they’d either take it from the money I’d then have trapped in my account, which I’d consider theft, or send me a bill, which would make no sense.
If PredictIt has to go away, I absolutely believe there’s no way to do that fairly between now and the end of this election cycle.
I understand that PredictIt was offered a NAL and, probably, took massive liberties in regards to the terms involved. Particularly in the form of those Tweet markets (which were dead before Trump was banned from Twitter). But PredictIt is a societal good that lets you understand the climate and what’s happening. And it’s not a game of chance, and I think that there’s a real loss to research and to common sense if it’s shuttered. And I’m asking you to please not do it.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,I would like to protest;for me;I donated money;I based my decision;I refer to PredictIt;I can make practical decisions;I’m not sure;I personally had negative-66-dollars,"The comment is filled with personal anecdotes, first-person pronouns ('I','me','my'), and a detailed recounting of the author's individual experiences and decision-making processes related to PredictIt, indicating a personal perspective rather than an organizational one."

As a member of the futures and swaps industry for a number of years, I am in complete opposition to the Commission’s proposed rule. I appreciate the opportunity to comment to the Commission and share my thoughts for the Commission to consider.
The material of Proposed Rule 89 FR 48968 raises similar questions to KalshiEX’s submissions for political control contracts, Industry Filing Number 22-002 and Industry Filing 23-01. The CFTC received the following response to questions posed by those public inquiries, and the response is equally relevant to the CFTC’s current request.
I therefore adopt that comment as my own, and I enter it into the record before the CFTC for consideration. The CFTC cannot ignore this valuable information in coming to its decision now. Ignoring it would be ignoring my comment.
I add the following for clarity and the avoidance of doubt, which I think is necessary because I think that it is possible, if not likely, that the CFTC will look to ignore or discount any comment that is in support of the contract because of its demonstrated bias against the contract. I am commenting on the proposed rule in response to the CFTC’s current request for comment. My comment cannot be ignored on the grounds that the information that I am submitting to you was already submitted to you in response to an earlier and identical or materially similar question, because I am submitting this information to you now in response to your current questions. And the information that I am submitting is relevant information, just as any other information that is submitted to you is relevant. Certainly the Commission would not be at liberty to ignore my opinion or analysis if it was based on some other information, and certainly the Commission is not at liberty to ignore my opinion or analysis based on the highly relevant information that I include in my comment. This information is highly relevant because it was submitted in response to an identical or materially similar question. Further, even without that point, it is my opinion that the information is relevant, and therefore the Commission has to either accept the relevance or explain in a manner that is neither arbitrary nor capricious why it is not relevant. And as I’ve made very clear, saying that the information is not relevant because it was not submitted in response to this particular round of questions is false, and facially arbitrary and capricious because I am submitting it to you in response to these questions on the gourds that I have determined that it is relevant.",1,https://comments.cftc.gov/Handlers/PdfHandler.ashx?id=35551,74482ChristopherGreenwood.pdf,INDIVIDUAL,"I write in response; As a member; I am in complete opposition; I appreciate the opportunity to comment; I therefore adopt that comment as my own; I add the following for clarity; Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Commissioners; As a former Chairwoman; I write to provide my formal comments","The comment is written in a personal tone, uses 'I' and'my' frequently, and presents a personal stance on the proposed rule, despite mentioning a past role as a Senator."

Dodd-Frank was first drafted in 2009, 15 years ago. CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) in that legislation is referenced is the impetus for drafting this proposed rule in the first place.
In the year, 2009, most of us equated Artificial Intelligence with something out of a Steven Spielberg movie, social media and smartphones were in their infancy as were the gig economy and remote work as we know it.
Gaming at that time was not widely accepted. Integrity in sports was of great concern and a key factor in determining that preventing widespread adoption of “gaming” was not in the public interest.
Times have changed. Professional sports leagues have embraced gaming through official lucrative partnerships. And one of the Senators who helped write the CEA has effectively said as much in a rebuke of the proposed rule before us.
What we know now is that Gaming should never have been adjacent to, as a subject counter to public interest, as acts of terrorism, assassination or war. The notion that someone has an idea that their local baseball team will win a game that night and they have the ability to find an accepting counterparty to “put money on it”, even a friend on the other side of the couch, could be counter to “public interest” to the level of an act of war in its nature is unimaginable.
The CFTC in this proposed rule aims to make this harmless act impermissible if facilitated through basic means of technology offered by a CFTC-regulated entity. Such an entity, I argue, is providing an essential service to in public interest.
1) Entities that offer gaming that are regulated by a trusted governing body provide an important service to citizens in lieu of wholly unregulated entities.
Today, half of American adults who love to watch sports still cannot participate in sports prediction markets through a legal entity. Despite the repeal of PASPA in 2018, many states have been mired in political squabbling and Tribal issues that have delayed citizens’ ability to engage in the harmless activity of making a sports prediction and placing money on it. In those states, the primary way to do so is with entities who are under no regulation whatsoever, sometimes at their own financial risk.
2) The Wire Act puts up barriers to gaming entities to effectively operate, making offering gaming via CFTC-regulated entities a viable alternative
The Wire Act has served as a cumbersome burden to gaming entities in modern day. It effectively prevents “exchanges” from operating because it requires that all trading information be sequestered in one state and not cross the border to another state. This means that for modern day gaming entities operating in the cloud, something obviously not considered in 1961, they must invest hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not greater than $1 million for setting up a server in each state. And there is not enough liquidity for an exchange to operate.
3) States are unable to effectively regulate the gaming industry.
Complicated by the impacts of Covid and facing many budget crises, states are thirsting for tax revenues. It is the primary reason that they stand up a gaming industry to begin with. The desire to placate a large segment of the citizenry that loves sports and the desire to protect them from unregulated entities are distant considerations. States have put up so many barriers that “Main Street” businesses are all but excluded from participating in the industry. Every state has its own set of rules that require strict compliance and only large companies can afford to pay lobbyists to have input. When consumers cry for help and complain about companies making an unfair decision, regulators look the other way. Their tax revenue depends on doing so. The relationship between state regulators and large operators has grown cozy at the detriment to some extent of the citizens. In the one state, Massachusetts, where Gaming regulators have taken the key step of considering citizen issues, operators have so far refused to engage in the public process.
4) In lieu of exchanges and effective state regulation, sports wagering operators have taken advantage of citizens.
This is well-summarized in a recent Wall Street Journal article about operators kicking out winners and encouraging more play from losers. You can also consider a report from Australia titled, “You Win Some, You Lose More” that details the same phenomenon. Regulatory capture has occurred as rules in states have largely been created with input from large public companies. These large companies are incentivized to increase quarterly profits again and again. They write the rules and they are the counterparty. It is not far-fetched to say that it is a rigged game.
In closing, there is a dire need for gaming in the U.S. to transform. In lieu of Congress modifying the Wire Act to help modernize the gaming industry and make it a more healthy environment in which citizens may participate, the CFTC can act now.
By not acting. By not finalizing this overly restrictive and ill-conceived rule around gaming. There is an opportunity for the CFTC to effectively regulate gaming on a national level, that is to determine far more precisely what the nature of “gaming” conducted against the public interest may constitute. But that will take time to explore.
It may be time well worth taking.",0,,,ORGANIZATION,If we take a common sense step back;we;our members;we know now;Entities that offer gaming;States are unable to effectively regulate;operators have taken advantage of citizens,"The comment consistently uses collective pronouns ('we', 'our') and discusses the actions and interests of a broader group, suggesting representation of an organization rather than a single individual."

1) CFTC bringing broad gaming under its umbrella, not banning it broadly, will actually facilitate more integrity, not less.
This comment is partially a rebuttal to the NFL's position that the CFTC allowing event contracts related to its league could undermine its integrity but that couldn't be further from the truth.
For example, the NBA, under Commissioner Adam Silver, started advocating for legalized and regulated sports betting as early as 2014. Silver argued that a legal, regulated sports betting market would be better for the integrity of the games because it would bring more transparency, allow for better monitoring of betting patterns, and help identify suspicious activity more effectively than an illegal, underground market.
This came to fruition this year as a player was caught in a scheme to leave a game early. The bets were made on a legal platform therefore the scheme was found out.
The issue of election integrity also applies to election markets. Again, this year, there was a political betting scandal in the UK in which members of the Prime Minister's cabinet allegedly got news of a general elections date before the general public and placed wagers with a legal sportsbook. There is an ongoing investigation as I write this. Those ""bets"" were only discovered because they took place with a regulated entity.
This should not stop the CFTC from applying light conditions to regulated entities wishing to offer certain contracts. For example, requiring that entities void a ""Who will be president?"" event contract if one of the choices has been assassinated seems like an obvious but simple condition.
An entity wishing to offer event contracts around sports may be required to partner with an integrity-focused organization that has partnerships with leagues and authorities. Where CFTC needs to be careful is not to build out too many regulations that make it impossible for entities to offer such markets.
The more open that the world is to event contracts related to gaming, the better off we will be. Currently, I would speculate that over 80-90% of global event contract volume occurs by unregulated entities. This is become lawmakers and regulators are reluctant, perhaps for political or optical reasons.
As we move forward, event contracts will grow in demand as an increasingly social world coalesces around events: political events, sporting events, concerts, celebrities. We are all in tune all the time. Over $1 billion in event contract volume will take place around the current election cycle and that is for only one entity offering it.
A CFTC final rule now will cause strife for years to come as companies will try to find creative ways to meet billions of dollars of consumer demand for event contracts. And they will do it in an unregulated space. The CFTC should not step in the way of further innovation in this sector and delay with intent to greatly modify or eliminate this rule, if needed.",0,,,INDIVIDUAL,"""I wish to add""; ""my previous comment""; ""as I write this""; ""I would speculate""; ""consumer demand""","The comment consistently uses first-person pronouns and presents personal opinions and observations, indicating an individual perspective despite the topic's complexity."

August 7th, 2024
I write to express my disagreement with the Commission’s proposed amendments to its rules concerning event contracts (“17 CFR Part 40 Event Contracts”) [1].
Summary
I appreciate the Commission’s desire to provide clarity in the area of event contracts to reduce burden and wasted effort by registered entities, new applicants, and the Commission’s staff. However, I believe that the Commission has incorrectly evaluated the public interest consideration of these contracts - contracts involving political events are very much in the public interest, serving to strengthen, not weaken, our democratic electoral process. The volatile political events of this summer 2024, occurring after the amendments were proposed, highlight the demand and need for fast access to the wisdom of the crowds provided by these event contracts. The Commission should be wary of the unintended consequences of limiting these contracts to platforms where Americans cannot participate and where the Commission cannot regulate them. Finally, I ask the Commission to reconsider and identify alternative solutions to its concerns with regards to how to structure political event contracts (to avoid putting the Commission in the position of an elections cop), and how “activity unlawful under state law” relates to event contracts.
Outline of Arguments
1. Contracts involving political events are very much in the public interest. The political events of summer 2024 have shown the importance and demand of the wisdom generated by such event contracts.
2. If the Commission is genuinely concerned about the impact of political event contracts on the integrity of our elections, it should strongly consider the unintended consequences of further cementing the influence of unregulated offshore event contract platforms accessible only to foreign actors.
3. The Commission can enable event contracts to be structured in ways that do not put it in the position of being an elections cop.
4. The Commission’s interpretation about political event contracts “involves activity that is unlawful under state law” is misguided upon closer reading of the authority given to the Commission.
Arguments
The Commission asks: “Are there factors, in addition to those described herein, that may be relevant when evaluating whether a contract, or category of contracts, is contrary to the public interest?”
1. Contracts involving political events are very much in the public interest. The political events of summer 2024 have shown the importance and demand of the wisdom generated by such event contracts.
Commenters in favor of political event contracts have spoken at length to their value in previous comment periods relating to Nadex and, more recently, Kalshi [2]. I submit my personal support in favor of these contracts. While I personally do not trade in significant volume on platforms like PredictIt or Kalshi, I am a frequent consumer of the wisdom they provide. Those platforms, along with play-money prediction markets like Manifold, are the primary ways I get my news, especially political news. They allow me to be a more informed citizen due to their wisdom-of-the-crowds approach of aggregating all other news sources into quantitative probabilities. These markets are the most effective method we have of deriving intelligence (i.e. “price discovery” of political outcomes) that financially rewards those who are free of opinion and bias for anything but the truth.
In footnote 125 of the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Commission rightly states that “Certain commenters on the contracts subject to the Kalshi Order asserted that event contracts involving occurrences in connection with political election contests could serve as a check on misinformation and inaccurate polling, stating that market-based alternatives tend to be more accurate than polling or other methods of predicting election outcomes.” I agree with those commenters.
The Commission goes on to express the concern that “a seemingly false or unreliable poll [can cause] significant movement on an event contract market and [suggests] that such poll could have been, or at least could be, created to cause such market movement; further arguing that such false polls can have a real and detrimental effect on elections.” citing an article [3] by former FiveThirtyEight journalist Harry Enten. Since writing that article, Enten has publicly commented [4] on the usefulness of political event markets to understand the conventional wisdom and regularly references such markets in his current position as a Senior Data Reporter at CNN [5]. This suggests that the fear of fake polling having a significant negative impact on the value of prediction markets is overblown relative to the value these markets provide. In my anecdotal experience in the political forecasting twittersphere, misinformation and inaccurate polls are noticed and publicized as a result of the overall trading community having a financial incentive to identify and flag them
All this said, these arguments in favor of political event contracts do not yet seem to have been persuasive to the Commission, as suggested by these latest proposed amendments to categorize political event contracts as “contrary to the public interest”. Therefore, I implore the Commission to reconsider its position given the volatile political events of summer 2024 following the Commission’s notice of this proposed rulemaking.
This summer, which has seen unprecedented political uncertainty following the presidential debate between President Biden and former President Trump, an attempted assassination of former President Trump, President Biden’s subsequent withdrawal from the race, Vice President Harris’ quick rise to nomination, and two major party vice presidential candidate selections, has shown the importance and demand of the wisdom generated by prediction market platforms offering political event contracts or the like. Polymarket alone has hit record high trading volume [6] in both June ($111.6M) and July ($387.0M), up to over 600% of its previous high in May ($63.0M), suggesting that we are in a era that is different and distinct from the time during which the proposed rulemaking was drafted. As such, the Commission should take a renewed look at its perspective that political event contracts are “contrary to the public interest”.
2. If the Commission is genuinely concerned about the impact of political event contracts on the integrity of our elections, it should strongly consider the unintended consequences of further cementing the influence of unregulated offshore event contract platforms accessible only to foreign actors.
As evidenced by the aforementioned increase in demand of Polymarket’s political events contract product, I urge the Commission to carefully consider whether it wants to hand the gift of a monopoly on political event contracts to Polymarket. It is illegal for Americans to participate in Polymarket, and as such, it is only available to foreign actors. If the Commission is genuinely concerned about the impact of political event contracts on the integrity of our elections, and Polymarket is becoming an authoritative source on political news through its political events contracts, the Commission should consider unintended consequences of excluding Americans from these markets. These are the people who are closest to, as Chairman Benham stated [7], the “uniquely American experience of participating in the democratic electoral process” who could provide improved accuracy to “price discovery” on political topics. As such, the Commission should carefully evaluate the risks of cementing the influence of foreign actors through these unregulated offshore platforms.
3. The Commission can enable event contracts to be structured in ways that do not put it in the position of being an elections cop.
In Chairman Benham’s statement [7], he expresses the concern that “Allowing these contracts would push the CFTC, a financial market regulator, into a position far beyond its Congressional mandate and expertise.  To be blunt, such contracts would put the CFTC in the role of an election cop.” This seems like it could be easily avoided by ensuring clear resolution terms for a contract. For example, rather than a contract that resolves according to a particular winner of an election, the Commission could require event contracts along the lines of “Who will be president on January 21st, 2025?” (the day after inauguration day) with clear instructions, including potential delay in resolution as needed, in the event of any disputes. Similarly, the Commission could decide not to permit “the outcome of a political contest, including an election or elections” but permit “an occurrence or nonoccurrence in connection with such a contest or game, regardless of whether it directly affects the outcome”, such as whether a certain individual is reported by the New York Times as being sworn in on Inauguration Day. The Commission would therefore be only responsible for investigating fraud, manipulation, and the like to the reporting by such an organization, not the underlying political events themselves.
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of its proposed public interest determination with respect to contracts involving activity that is unlawful under federal or state law.
4. The Commission’s interpretation about political event contracts “involves activity that is unlawful under state law” is misguided upon closer reading of the authority given to the Commission.
Even if the Commission believes that political event contracts are contrary to the public interest, I agree with Kalshi’s argument [8] that the Commission's authority in determining whether a contract is contrary to the public interest is limited only to if “the contract “involve[s]” one of six enumerated activities [including] “activity that is unlawful under any Federal or State law”. Given that elections are not unlawful, then contracts on them should not be subject to the public interest evaluation. The Commission’s perceived authority to subject a contract to an evaluation of public interest simply because the act of trading on such contract may be unlawful under a state law is an overreach - it’s not the trading that is subject to state law, but rather the underlying event in the contract.
Thank you for your consideration,
David Glidden

The Commission requests comment on all aspects of its proposal to amend the language of §§ 40.11(a)(1)-(2) and 40.11(c) to more precisely track, in the description of “excluded commodities,” the text of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C). In particular, the Commission requests comment on its interpretation that the reference to “section 1a(2)(i),” in the parenthetical in CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C)(i), is a typographical or drafting error, and that the intention was to refer to the excluded commodities described in CEA section 1a(19)(i).
Comment. I agree.
The Commission further requests comment on the examples provided of event contracts that the Commission believes would generally fall outside of the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and § 40.11. In particular, the Commission requests comment on the following questions:
Are there additional types of event contracts that should be explicitly identified by the Commission in the non-exclusive list of contract types that would generally fall outside of the scope of CEA section 5c(c)(5)(C) and § 40.11?
Comment. Yes, there are many. The CFTC’s conception of the statute is erroneous, and that error continues to its conception of the implementing regulations. The CFTC is creating significantly more uncertainty than it is solving. It is creating new definitions, inconsistencies, and questions and is actually making a working rule worse.
In order to remedy this CFTC-created confusion, the CFTC should list all event contracts that have ever been self-certified as contracts that fall outside the scope the statute and the regulation cited above.
What indices or measures are “other macroeconomic index[es] or measure[s]” for purposes of CEA section 1a(19)(i)? Are tax rates (e.g., corporate and capital gains tax rates) among such macroeconomic measures?
Comment: There are many such contracts. It is important that the CFTC consider its implicit bias on what it considers to be a valuable metric vs one that it dismisses.  The Kalshi contract on the price of a Costco hotdog, for example, is a good measure of macroeconomic climate. Even though the attorneys and economists in the CFTC might not be familiar with this and similar ideas as macroeconomic measures, that is irrelevant. The CFTC’s familiarity, or even enthusiasm, is not the metric by which a measure becomes valuable. It is not the CFTC’s job, not their expertise, and not their purview to call people like Jenn McMillen liars, or ignore what she’s saying. I for one agree with her, and that it is sufficient to make this a valuable contract to me. Regardless of what the CFTC thinks about the wisdom of my beliefs, because that is not relevant, this, and similar contracts, are valuable macroeconomic indicators.
RFC 2
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of its proposal to amend § 40.11 to remove the terms “relate to” and “reference” wherever they appear, and to refer in the regulation only to event contracts that “involve” an Enumerated Activity or prescribed similar activity.
Comment: First, the proposed regulation fails to describe the impact of the proposed amendment, and fails to articulate a rationale for this amendment. The multiple columns of text (roughly three pages in the voting draft) devoted to this amendment, do not describe the impact of the amendment and do not provide a rationale for why it should be made. This is a per se violation of the APA, and the Commission cannot finalize this rule as proposed because of these failures.
Further, the text that the CFTC does include is an analysis of its foundational premise that a contract falls under 40.11 and the statute if the contract, taken as a whole, involves one of the enumerated activities (as opposed to the interpretation put forth by Kalshi exchange that the relevant inquiry is limited to the underlying event). In addition to being irrelevant to the change being discussed, it is wrong. The relevant inquiry is the underlying event. There have been numerous comments in the prior CFTC rounds which the CFTC references and which the CFTC has in its files, and also in the ongoing litigation with Kalshi exchange, and I incorporate those comments into mine by reference. I do not need to attach the files here, that would be duplicative, and the CFTC already has these files in its possession and has no excuse for ignoring them, as I am specifically referencing them in the context of this proposal. The CFTC’s approach, and all the implications of that approach, are incorrect and should not be finalized.
With regard to the proposed change that the RFC is referring to, in addition to being in violation of the APA, the change is certainly substantive. The original regulation added two words relate and reference to the word “involve”. There are only three choices here: Either i. The additional words have no meaning, in which case the change proposed here is not substantive, ii. The additional words expanded upon the word involve to be more expansive, or iii. The additional words restricted the meaning of involved. Choices i and ii impugn the original drafters as either careless, or in flagrant violation of the APA. Option iii makes sense.
Given this choice, it is not surprising that the drafters of this reg chose to hide the ball. Either they impugn their colleagues as bad drafters, or worse, or they have to admit that the reg as drafted is contrary to the position that they have dug in. No good choices there.
But this is to no avail. The CFTC is obligated to describe the substantive changes, and this proposed change is a major change, and the CFTC is required to  provide its rationale, and it failed at both. This does not work. The CFTC has to either explain what the words were doing in the original reg in the first place and cogently demonstrate that they were superfluous (meaning, in plain English, the CFTC will be saying “Hey folks, our first reg we wrote was garbage, so we’re fixing it”), or not make this change in the final
RFC 3
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of its proposed definition of the term “gaming.” In particular, the Commission requests comment on the following questions:
Are there examples of activities that would constitute “gaming” that may fall outside of the proposed definition?
Comment: It is not clear what this question is asking. If the question is “is there a different definition of gaming that we should consider”, then why not just ask that? This would be textbook poor reg drafting. If the question is something else, it is illogical. I’ll assume that you’re asking if there is a different definition of gaming that you should consider, and the answer is yes. And if that is not what you’re asking, no great loss, because you need to consider this alternative anyway.
But first, I believe that your preamble explanation is deficient under the APA. You state that the proposal will bring regulatory clarity, but you cannot point to any instance of regulatory ambiguity you are solving. In fact, this claim seems to be disingenuous in the extreme. At least based on what is publicly known (ErisX RSBIX contracts, and Kalshi’s election contract), there is no ambiguity here. There is a disagreement. The CFTC interprets the law one way, and exchanges the other way. That is not ambiguity, that is a legal question. An alternative, and perhaps more honest way of saying this, is that you disagree with the legal interpretations that industry has taken and you want to codify your position in order to make it more difficult for industry to take an opposing position. Your position hides this, and therefore fails to satisfy your requirements regarding the proposal.
To answer the question, though, the definition of gaming is fundamentally flawed:
Relying on state law definitions is an odd choice for the regulator of an industry that is largely illegal under those very state laws.
There is no indication that Congress intended this definition. Additionally, as you note, you pick and choose between state laws that you like and that you don’t.
The definition of gaming in the proposed relies on the definition adopted in the Kalshi order, and also in the ErisX RSBIX (at least based on the CFTC statements issued about that). That definition is flawed, as explained in the CFTC statements on ErisX RSBIX and in the Kalshi law suit filings.
The CFTC in the proposal is, in what seems to be more disingenuity, playing a bit fast and loose with its dictionary. The CFTC, happy to rely on its dictionary when it suits it, seems to conveniently forget about it when it does not. The CFTC looked at the dictionary definitions for gaming to see that it matches gambling, and then seems to have shut the dictionary rather quickly, because in addition to using gaming and gambling “interchangeably” (an arguable point), the dictionaries actually do something more; they in fact, define both gaming and gambling, and it is here that apparently the dictionary lost the CFTC. Merriam-Webster online defines gaming, in the first definition, as “the practice or activity of playing games for stakes” and then associates gaming with gambling. Gambling is defined as “the practice or activity of betting : the practice of risking money or other stakes in a game or bet.” The Cambridge dictionary online defines gaming as “the risking of money in games of chance, especially at a casino.” The same dictionary defines gambling as “the activity of betting money, for example in a game or on a horse race.” Dictionary.com defines gaming with the single word “gambling”, and defines gambling as “the activity or practice of playing at a game of chance for money or other stakes.” All dictionary definitions have three things in common. First, they contain the concept of a “game”. Second, they are all ignored by the CFTC. Third, they are incompatible with the CFTC’s proposed definition of gaming. (Number 3 likely explains number 2).
The word “game” is also defined. There is greater variety in the definitions given for games, but the large majority of dictionaries easily accessible online are variations of Britanica’s definition, “a physical or mental activity or contest that has rules and that people do for pleasure” or  dictionary.com’s “. What emerges from the normal, dictionary definitions of the word gaming and its component parts, is that gaming involves a entertainment, recreation, a passtime, or a game. Gaming requires a game.
